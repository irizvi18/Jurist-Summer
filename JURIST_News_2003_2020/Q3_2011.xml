		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said Thursday that the recent wave of Middle East and North African protests and revolutions showed a <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11194&LangID=E">basic need for human rights</a> [text]. Pillay <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/GlobalshiftsinHRcreatenewopportunities.aspx">recounted</a> [summary text] the efforts of the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in these conflict areas: fact finding missions in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-to-probe-gaddafi-over-libya-torture-allegations.php">Libya</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-human-rights-council-to-investigate-human-rights-abuses-in-ivory-coast.php">Ivory Coast</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">Syria</a> [JURIST report] and country offices created in Tunisia and Egypt. Most of her speech was not focused on the UN's efforts, but the courage and inspiration of human rights protesters:<blockquote>The collective actions of the people of North Africa and the Middle East have reaffirmed the importance and universality of human rights in a way we could not have dreamed of on 1 January this year. We all want, we all deserve, and we are all entitled to have our rights observed&#8212;not partially, not sometimes, not at the whim of dictators or other repressive rulers and authorities, but all of us, all of the time, everywhere. That is THE message of the Arab Spring, and it is a message that has reverberated all across the world, stimulating discussion and dialogue, and renewed hope in the power of people to realize change. It has also produced some other interesting, unforeseen and important shifts.</blockquote>Pillay also praised the UNHRC's <a href = "http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4242370.PDF">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF], the first UN resolution to call for an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">end to sexuality discrimination worldwide</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay also pleaded for more funding for the UNHRC, saying her office is "stretched to breaking point."

<p>Pillay referred to several ongoing conflicts in her speech, including the success of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, although she admitted conflict and injustices in both nations still exist. Last week, Tunisia <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/415C6300-58BF-4245-9BB7-F8A317966E35.htm">acceded</a> [press release] to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], which is now <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-ratifies-rome-statute-joining-icc.php">set to become effective</a> [JURIST report] in the country on September 1, 2011. A trial date for former Egyptian president <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>] was <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/egypt-to-try-mubarak-in-august.php">set</A> [JURIST report] for <a href = "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/13429/Egypt/Politics-/Mubaraks-to-be-tried-on--August-for-corruption-and.aspx">August 3 at the Cairo Criminal Court</a> [MENA report]. However, other countries remain in turmoil. Bahraini <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] announced this week that an independent commission will <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Khalifa said that the country had already begun to move forward from the violence, but maintained that the commission would seek to uncover who should be held responsible. The ICC also this week <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099314.pdf">issued arrest warrants</a> [decision, PDF] against Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and two of his high-ranking officials, for <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">alleged crimes against the people</a> [JURIST report] of <A href = "/feature/2011/06/libya.php">Libya</a> [JURIST backgrounder] to quell the revolt that began last February. Last week, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11183&LangID=E">announced</a> [text] that it <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-investigators-to-asses-yemen-human-rights-situation.php">plans to send a panel to investigate the human rights situation</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/countries/MENARegion/Pages/YEIndex.aspx">Yemen</a> [OHCHR backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/drupal6/">US District Court for the District of South Dakota</a> [official website] issued a <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/docs/16511449869c5cb1ed1[1].pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF] Thursday blocking a South Dakota <a href = "http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Bill=1217">abortion regulation</a> [HB 1217] requiring a 72-hour waiting period. Judge Karen Shreier ruled that the <a href = "http://www.aclusd.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota</a> (ACLUSD) and <a href = "http://www.plannedparenthood.org/mn-nd-sd/">Planned Parenthood Federation of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota</a> [advocacy websites] were likely to succeed on their claims provisions in the law violate doctors' and patients' First Amendment rights and creates an undue burden on woman seeking <a href = "/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive]. In addition to mandating a three-day waiting period for an abortion, the law requires that a woman seeking an abortion consult a "pregnancy help center" geared toward preventing abortions and be informed of "risk factors" of the abortion, and requires the doctor to certify that the woman has not been "coerced" into making her decision. The waiting period is the longest passed by any state. Mimi Liu, the attorney working with Planned Parenthood who argued the case, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/local-press-releases/court-blocks-south-dakota-&#8216;crisis-pregnancy-center-abortion-law-37162.htm">praised the decision</a> [press release]: <blockquote>This law takes restricting access to abortion to a whole new level. If implemented, it would have the practical effect of requiring many of our patients to drive the equivalent of halfway across the country to access an abortion. On top of that, it would force our patients to discuss their most private medical information with an unlicensed, non-medical group that is opposed to abortion. We are happy and relieved for our patients that the court&#8217;s decision today means they will not have to suffer through these outrageous and demeaning requirements.</blockquote>The judge found that the requirements on the doctor provide certain information and for the woman to retrieve certain information violated their First Amendment rights and were not narrowly tailored to meet the state's interest. Further, the waiting period and the requirement the woman go to a "pregnancy help center" created an undue burden on the women violating their constitutional right to an abortion. HB 1217 amends <a href="http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Statute=34-23A&Type=Statute">South Dakota law on abortions</a> [SDCL 34-23A].

<p>South Dakota <a href = "http://sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] HB 1217 into law in March. Daugaard has said he was prepared for the state attorney to defend the law against the ACLU and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">challenge</a> [JURIST report] alluding to a private donor willing to finance the endeavor. South Dakota is one of many states which has recently been introducing more restrictive abortion laws. The <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in June in favor of a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy</a> {JURIST report], making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. Earlier that week, Minnesota <a href="http://markdayton.org/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks.

The judge ruled, based on expert testimony, that materials by L Ron Hubbard "aimed at creating an isolated social group whose members are trained to flawless execution of their functions, much of which is to fight with the world." In addition to <em>What Is Scientology?</em>, <a href = "http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/scientology-literature-declared-extremist/439845.html">two dozen essays</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] were also banned.

<p>In 2009, the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] found that Russia <a href = "http://www.coe.int/T/d/Kommunikation_und_politische_Forschung/Presse_und_Online_Info/Presseinfos/2007/20070405-208-GH-Ru.asp">discriminated</a> [press release] against the Church of Scientology by <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/europe-rights-court-rules-russia.php">barring their attempts to re-register as an organized religion</a> [JURIST report]. In 2008, the German government <a href = "/paperchase/2008/11/germany-government-drops-scientology.php">ended an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the practices of the <a href="http://www.scientology.org/">Church of Scientology</a> [church website].

When Leal Garcia was arrested for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl, he was denied consular access, as required by the <A href = "http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [text, PDF]. As a result, he was assigned a public aid attorney who had been sanctioned numerous times for ethical violations, which he contends caused his conviction. There was then a hearing in the <a href = "http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website], which <a href = "http://www.humbertoleal.org/docs/Avena-Judgment-full-text.pdf">held</a> [judgment, PDF] that Leal Garcia was entitled to a hearing on the consular rights violation in his case. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] wrote a personal letter to Perry asking for Leal Garcia's sentence to be commuted. In addition, two UN Special Rapporteurs made <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11198&LangID=E">statements</a> [text] that if the death sentence is carried out, it will be "tantamount to an arbitrary deprivation of life." Another spokesperson for the OHCHR, Rupert Colville, said, "The lack of consular assistance and advice raises concerns about whether or not Mr. Leal Garcia's right to a fair trial was fully upheld." Leal Garcia's execution is scheduled for July 7, which <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/07/us-texas-humberto-leal-execution">Perry has stated will go on as planned</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Leal Garcia's defense team filed a <a href = "http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/58930660?access_key=key-1dg0n5yfla13y5aboxs7"><em>writ of certiorari</em></a> [text] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] earlier this week in an attempt to stay the execution. The government of Mexico <a href = "http://tcadp.org/2011/06/28/u-s-supreme-court-urged-to-stay-execution-of-humberto-leal-garcia/">filed</a> [press release] an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief as well.

<p>US President Barack Obama and former president George W. Bush both denounced the sentence, with Bush issuing an <A href = "http://www.humbertoleal.org/docs/Bush-memorandum.pdf">executive memoranda</a> [text, PDF] that Texas had to comply with the ICJ's ruling.  The Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/medvtex">Medellin v. Texas</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-rules-in-federally.php">report</a>], that Bush did not have the authority to direct a state court to comply with a ruling from the ICJ. However, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Congress could make the treaty binding in domestic law. Senator <A href = "http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] is attempting to do this by introducing the <a href = "http://leahy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/BillText-ConsularNotificationComplianceAct.pdf">Consular Notification Compliance Act</a> [text, PDF] earlier this month, which is currently <a href = "http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-1194">in committee</a> [bill materials]. Texas has already executed <a href = "/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-second-foreign-national.php">two Mexican nationals</a> [JURIST report] who were denied consular access.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/">Greek Parliament</a> [official website, in Greek] passed the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-greece-austerity-20110701,0,4755540.story">new austerity measures</a> [LAT report] Thursday with $40 billion in budget cuts, in addition to selling $72 billion in state assets, under pressure from them <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) and the <a href="http://www.ecb.int/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> [official websites], which want to stave off Europe's first sovereign default. But Lumina urged a balancing of this interest with Greece's human rights obligations. Lumina said: <blockquote>The implementation of the second package of austerity measures and structural reforms, which includes a wholesale privatization of state-owned enterprises and assets, is likely to have a serious impact on basic social services and therefore the enjoyment of human rights by the Greek people, particularly the most vulnerable sectors of the population such as the poor, elderly, unemployed and persons with disabilities. The rights to food, water, adequate housing, and work under fair and equitable conditions should not be compromised by the implementation of austerity measures strike a careful balance between austerity and the realization of human rights, taking into account the primacy of States' human rights obligations. ... A shrinking economy cannot generate any revenue and contributes to a reduced capacity to repay the debt. More time should have been allowed for the restructuring measures already in place to work. The problem of insolvency needs to be addressed as part of the rescue plan.</blockquote> Thousands of people across Greece have been rioting and demonstrating in protest to the austerity measures.

<p>Dimitrios Ioannidis of Roach, Ioannidis &#38; Megaloudis, LLC, has <a href="http://jurist.org/sidebar/2011/06/dimitrios-ioannidis-greek-tragedy.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the debt crisis in Greece is in part the result of deregulation of US financial markets coupled with the strategic use of complex financial instruments. He argues that hedging by financiers on the Greece's default similar and related to the credit default swaps that drove the US housing market meltdown. Last month, Greek <a href="http://www.papandreou.gr/papandreou/content/Home.aspx?d=6&rd=7739474&f=-1&rf=-1&m=-1&rm=-1&l=1">Prime Minister George Papandreou</a> [official website] proposed undertaking a constitutional referendum arguing its necessity in order to eliminate the systemic governmental inefficiency and waste that led to the country's recent economic crisis [BBC backgrounder] and to prosecute corrupt officials. But opponents described the proposal as a politically-motivated tactic to shift the dialogue away from questions of Papandreou's competency. In May 2010, the EU and IMF announced the initial &#8364;110 billion bailout package for Greece, which was subsequently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8669488.stm">approved by euro-zone leaders</a> [BBC report]. The following day, Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/german-high-court-rejects-temporary-injunction-for-greece-bailout-funds.php">refused to issue a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the country's &#8364;22.4 billion contribution to the bailout fund. The suit, brought by the same group that had previously sought to block Germany's adoption of the euro, claimed that the contribution was unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Anonymous typically engages in distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), which disrupt bandwidth allocations causing web page owners to incur heavy fees and their websites to crash. LulzSec, who claimed to retire earlier this month, is primarily devoted to exposing holes in major websites' security, but also has taken up some political causes, such as attacking Arizona's <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=SB 1070">recent immigration legislation</a> [JURIST news archive]. They've released documents, usernames and passwords from several organizations, including: Fox News, PBS, Sony, the US Senate, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Arizona Department of Public Safety, AT&#38;T, Viacom, Disney, EMI, NBC Universal, and the US Navy. Several nations have made arrests from members of both organizations.

<p>Several countries have attempted to bolster cymbercrime security enforcement in recent years. Last week, the <a href="http://australia.gov.au/">Australian Government</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/www/ministers/mcclelland.nsf/Page/MediaReleases_2011_SecondQuarter_22June2011-Strongerlawstotacklecybercrime">introduced legislation</a> [press release] aimed at <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/australia-introduces-cybercrime-legislation-seeks-to-join-international-treaty.php">reinforcing current cybercrime laws</a> [JURIST report] and improving Australia's international cybercrime security. In early June, US authorities announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-investigating-google-allegations-of-china-hacking.php">investigating claims by Google</a> [JURIST report] that hundreds of personal Gmail accounts were breached by hackers in China. In November 2009, the Iranian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/iran-sets-up-committee-to-fight.php">announced the establishment of a new police unit</a> [JURIST report] to fight Internet crime, though opposition leaders said its true purpose was to crack down on protesters and voices of dissent, who rely on the Internet to get their message out. The Finnish legislature passed the <a href="http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2003/en20030460.pdf">Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media Act</a> [unofficial translation, PDF] in December 2008 that now <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-finds-finland-violated.php">provides a remedy to victims of Internet crime</a> [JURIST report], but it was not in effect at the time of an incident of Internet pedophilia. The <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/us-senate-ratifies-coe-cybercrime.php">US Senate ratified</a> [JURIST report] the COE Convention on Cybercrime, which is intended to improve information- and evidence-sharing  between national governments to prevent crimes on the Internet, in August 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecutor's office in the capital Abidjan <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE76013E20110701?sp=true">issued the warrants</a> [Reuters report], most notably for Charles Ble Goude, the leader of Gbagbo's youth militia, accusing him of inciting ethnic violence and attacks against UN workers. Other members of Gbagbo's government also had warrants issued for them including the government spokesman Ahoua Don Mello, industry minister Phillipe Attey, and the ambassador to Israel Raymond Koudou Kessie. Further, 21 others already in detention were charged for violence and inciting tribalism and xenophobia. Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured and forced from office</a> [JURIST report] after refusing to leave despite losing last November's election of now <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile], which resulted in months of fighting between Ouattara's and Gbagbo's forces. Goude was instrumental in Gbagbo's fight to remain in power rounding up a youth militia to help fight. 

<p>The Ivory Coast has begun the process of investigating the violence after the fight between Gbagbo and Ouattara. Last week, the Ivory Coast granted the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] permission to proceed with its investigation into the violence. As the Ivory Coast is not a member state of the ICC because it is not a signatory of the <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/0D8024D3-87EA-4E6A-8A27-05B987C38689/0/RomeStatuteEng.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], the ICC can only investigate with the Ivory Coast's express permission. The Ivory Coast announced earlier this month it would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">establish its own commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections. This investigation may take <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE75L02M20110622">up to two years</a> [Reuters report]. Also, an official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of ousted leader <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] earlier this month. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled that this unduly burdened minorities by abusing a political process where minorities were likely to have no redress.<blockquote>The Supreme Court's statements in Hunter and Seattle clarify that equal protection of the laws is more than a guarantee of equal treatment under the law substantively. It is also an assurance that the majority may not manipulate the channels of change in a manner that places unique burdens on issues of importance to racial minorities. In effect, the political process theory hews to the unremarkable belief that, when two competitors are running a race, one may not require the other to run twice as far, or to scale obstacles not present in the first runner's course. Ensuring the fairness of political processes, in particular, is essential, because an electoral minority is by definition disadvantaged in its attempts to pass legislation; and "discrete and insular minorities" are especially so given the unique hurdles they face.</blockquote>The Sixth Circuit's ruling reverses a 2008 decision by the <a href = "http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] to <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/michigan-affirmative-action-ban-ruled.php">dismiss the challenge</a> [JURIST report] with prejudice. Judge David Lawson had found that Proposal 2 was "facially neutral" regarding racial discrimination and did not violate the US Constitution.

<p>Michigan voters <A HREF="/paperchase/2006/11/michigan-voters-approve-affirmative.php">approved</A> [JURIST report] the constitutional amendment in November 2006, and it was initially expected to take effect in late December. In December 2006, a federal judge ruled that the <A HREF="/paperchase/2006/12/federal-judge-delays-michigan.php">universities could delay implementing the proposal</A> [JURIST report] until the they had completed the 2006-2007 admission cycle under current procedures, but that order was later <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/06a0476p-06.pdf">stayed</a> [opinion, PDF] by the Sixth Circuit. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2007/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to consider whether the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University could delay implementing Proposal 2 in early 2007. The amendment explicitly applied to the University of Michigan, whose affirmative action policies in admissions were reviewed by the US Supreme Court in the <span class="casename">Grutter</span> and <span class="casename">Gratz</span> cases in 2003. The court ruled that the US Constitution permitted the university to consider race as a factor in the admissions process, <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZS.html">upholding the University law school admissions policy</a> [<span class="casename">Grutter</span> opinion text] while <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-516.ZS.html">rejecting the more rigid undergraduate admissions system as discriminatory</a> [<span class="casename">Gratz</span> opinion text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs, responsible for the temporary storage of nuclear waste, challenged both a decision of the DOE to withdraw its application from the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (NRC) [official website] for Yucca Mountain and its apparent abandonment of that project. Chief Judge David Sentelle wrote the opinion of the panel's decision with the other two judges concurring, holding that the claims were not ripe since the NRC has not completed its four-year review process for the application filed by the Bush administration which will be complete in 2012. Santelle said:<blockquote>Between the Commission's possible review of the denial order and the Licensing Board's consideration of the Yucca Mountain license application, the only administrative outcome that will fail to resolve the issues presented in Petitioner's first claim would be if the Commission reviews and overturns the Licensing Board's denial, permitting the DOE to withdraw its license application. At that point, petitioners would have the opportunity to demonstrate whether the effects of the DOE action are felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.</blockquote> Further, Santelle held that the determination of the DOE to abandon the project was "simply not reviewable by this court." Also, President Barack Obama had promised to stop the plan to use Yucca Mountain, but last July, the three administrative law judges with the NRC <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/aslbpfuncdesc.html">Atomic Safety and Licensing Board</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/judges-rule-obama-cannot-close-yucca-waste-site-without-congressional-approval.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] by the Obama administration and the DOE to withdraw the government's application for a license to construct a permanent repository in Yucca Mountain. 

<p>The nuclear repository has not been welcomed by Nevada government officials, who have been mounting challenges against the site since Congress approved government plans to construct the facility in 2002. Government officials fear that the repository, which will be located 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, will negatively effect the city's $28 billion tourism industry. Rejecting challenges by Nevada officials, the DC Circuit ruled in 2004 that federal plans to build a nuclear waste site in the state were <a href="/paperchase/2004/07/appeals-court-rules-yucca-mountain.htm">constitutional under the Takings Clause</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2006 Nevada filed a lawsuit against the federal government, <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/nevada-sues-us-government-to-gain.php">seeking documents related to the repository</a> [JURIST report], including documents which allegedly contain information that the proposed site cannot meet <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/epa-puts-forward-new-radiation.php">radiation safety standards</a> [JURIST report] mandated by the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website]. Later that year Nevada filed suit in the DC Circuit Court challenging the DOE's Record of Decision (ROD) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) governing the transportation of waste to Yucca Mountain, alleging that both violated the National Environmental Policy Act. The court declined to review a DOE proposal to move nuclear waste to the repository by rail, finding that some <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-denies-nevada.php">claims by Nevada lacked merit</a> [JURIST report] while others were unripe. The application for the repository has been pending since 2008 when it was filed by former president George W. Bush. The repository was approved by Congress in 1987 to contain highly toxic waste from nuclear complexes that built atomic bombs during the Cold War.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If not for Judge Carlos Murguia's decision, two of the state's three clinics would have been <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/07/02/judge_puts_kansas_abortion_law_on_hold/">forced to close</a> [AP report], as they were unable to meet requirements from the <a href="http://www.kdheks.gov/">Kansas Department of Health and Environment</a> [official website], which were issued last month and took effect on Friday. The clinics' inability to conform to the health department's regulations that control aspects of the their operations ranging from what drugs must be stocked to the minimum size of recovery rooms, prevented them from obtaining a license as required by SB36, which also took effect on Friday. The injunction stemmed from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-group-sues-to-block-kansas-abortion-licensing-laws.php">lawsuit filed earlier this week</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of two doctors by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website], who allege that the regulations violate providers' due process as well as place an undue burden on patients seeking abortions.

<p>Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/about-the-office/governor-sam-brownback">Governor Sam Brownback</a> (R) [official website], a known opponent of abortion, approved the regulation at issue in May, one month after <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">signing</a> [JURIST report] two other pieces of legislation restricting abortions. In April, the governor approved the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF], requiring unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed, and the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">"fetal pain bill"</a> [HB 2218, PDF], which restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation. While states have been busy passing legislation seeking to restrict abortions, the courts are not always on board. In a move similar to the one taken by the District Court of Kansas, a judge for the <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/drupal6/">US District Court for the District of South Dakota</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-south-dakota-abortion-law-with-72-hour-waiting-period.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week, blocking a South Dakota <a href="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Bill=1217">abortion regulation</a> [HB 1217] requiring a 72-hour waiting period. Judge Karen Shreier ruled that the <a href="http://www.aclusd.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota</a> (ACLUSD) and <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/mn-nd-sd/">Planned Parenthood Federation of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota</a> [advocacy websites] were likely to succeed on their claims provisions in the law violate doctors' and patients' First Amendment rights and creates an undue burden on woman seeking abortions. The waiting period is the longest passed by any state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With 94 percent of polling stations reporting and 98 percent of voters in approval, Interior Minister Taib Cherkaoui <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hMmQQ_PBhEDDrJfhA__J91Gqp18g?docId=CNG.6b07e1d5b9141d93e660216b69b0b89d.b21">announced</a> [AFP report] that the revisions had passed. Under the new constitution, King Mohammed VI, who previously enjoyed almost absolute power, remains head of the army, but a variety of his other political powers are now held by the prime minister and parliament. In addition to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/07/20117154535570851.html">curbing the king's powers</a> [Al Jazeera report], the revision also guarantees more rights for women and makes Berber, an indigenous language, official. Mohammed <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/morocco-king-announces-constitutional-reforms.php">announced the changes</a> [JURIST report] last month, which many viewed as an attempt to put an end to the "Arab Spring" street protests that had been becoming more prevalent throughout the region. Prior to the king's announcement, in April, thousands of protesters <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/morocco-protesters-seek-radical-constitutional-reform.php">engaged in peaceful demonstrations</a> [JURIST report], vocalizing their demands for greater reform to the constitution as well as an end to corruption within the country. 

<p>Similar protests have occurred recently throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], and have resulted in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports]. Protests were also widespread in <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a> [JURIST backgrounder], where leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and his inner circle have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">accused of perpetrating violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, a three-person commission for the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) [official website] appointed to investigate violence in Libya <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] saying that government forces have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes under orders from Gaddafi and other high-ranking officials. The commission's 92-page report said Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances, and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law, passed by the <a href="http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/">Legislative Assembly</a> and issued by the president, places requirements on the judgments of the <a href="http://www.csj.gob.sv/constitu/sabia.htm">Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court</a> [official websites, in Spanish]. Knaul <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38917&Cr=&Cr1=">said</a> [press release] that requiring unanimous rulings will harm the judges' ability to function effectively. She said:<blockquote>El Salvador, as a country that is consolidating its democracy, should pay particular attention to the full independence of the judiciary and the principle of separation of powers enshrined in international instruments of which it is a party and which are enshrined in the Salvadoran constitution. The other branches of government cannot force the country's highest court to take judicial decisions unanimously, as the matters that fall within its competence are, by their very nature and complexity, controversial. [If followed, it] would block the activity and the effective functioning of the country's highest court and therefore substantially limit the rights of Salvadorian citizens to appeal to that court in defence of their fundamental rights.</blockquote> The law has been controversial in El Salvador where civic organizations are <a href="http://www.elsalvadornoticias.net/2011/06/15/organizaciones-continuan-su-ofensiva-por-la-derogacion-del-decreto-743/">pushing for its repeal</a> [<em>El Salvador Noticias</em> report], and it has sparked debate between the branches of government. 

<p>El Salvador has struggled with judicial independence in the past. In 2008, Hundreds of judges and lawyers in El Salvador <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/el-salvador-judges-protest-judicial.php">marched to the Supreme Court of Justice</a> [JURIST report] to protest challenges that the attorney general made to the rulings of four judges. Attorney General Felix Safie asked the Supreme Court to investigate judges' decisions, which freed prisoners convicted of acts of murder, robbery and rape prior to the expiration of their sentence. Other countries have also been passing laws restricting the independence of judges. Last month, the Taiwan <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/">Judicial Yuan</a> [official website] President Lai Hau-min <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/taiwan-passes-controversial-new-law-to-remove-judges.php">announced a new law to remove judges</a> [JURIST report] which subjects judges to committees that can discipline or fire them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/PIs'%20Prelim%20Injunction%20Mot%20filed%206.30.11.pdf">motion for a preliminary injunction</a> [text, PDF] Thursday to block a new Texas requiring a woman to have a sonogram with the doctor describing the fetus in detail before having an <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive]. The CRR <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] earlier last month challenging <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/HB00015E.pdf#navpanes=0">HB 15</a> [text; <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=HB15">materials</a>] and is now seeking to block its implementation, which is set to take place in September. The CRR argues that without an injunction the law will cause irreparable harm to physician facilities providing the services and to woman seeking abortions and seeks to enjoin its enforcement until a decision on the merits is made. The lawsuit claims that by forcing the physician to deliver government-mandated materials to the patient, it violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights of both the patient and of the physician. It forces patients to hear what CRR claims is politically-motivated speech before making a decision and forces physicians to deliver unwanted information. The complaint further argues that the law violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder] "by subjecting women to burdens not imposed on men; by perpetuating patronizing and paternalistic stereotypes of women as in need of special 'protections' and unable to make medical decisions on their own; and by enforcing the notion that a woman's primary and proper role is that of mother." 

<p>Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">signed HB 15 into law</a> [JURIST report] in May. It requires doctors to conduct a vaginal ultrasound and display the images at least 24 hours prior to an abortion, and strips them of their medical licenses should they fail to do so. The law also requires doctors to provide "a simultaneous verbal explanation of the results of the live, real-time sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of arms, legs, external members, and internal organs." The Texas law is one of a number of state laws passed recently attempting to restrict abortion rights. Last week, the CRR won a preliminary injunction in the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] to block a Kansas <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/sb36/">regulation</a> [SB36] requiring clinics within the state to obtain a license to perform abortions. Earlier last week, a judge for the <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/drupal6/">US District Court for the District of South Dakota</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-south-dakota-abortion-law-with-72-hour-waiting-period.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking a South Dakota <a href="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Bill=1217">abortion regulation</a> [HB 1217] requiring a 72-hour waiting period. Multiple states have enacted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsame-sex.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Rhode Island <a href="http://www.governor.ri.gov/">Governor Lincoln Chafee</a> [official website] on Saturday signed into law a <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText11/HouseText11/H6103Aaa.pdf">bill</a> [H6103, PDF] that legalizes same-sex civil unions in the state. The bill effectively adds a "Civil Unions" chapter to the Rhode Island General Laws section governing domestic relations, affording same-sex couples many of the same rights and benefits available to married couples. The bill is modeled on similar legislation in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">Illinois</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">Delaware</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-senate-approves-same-sex-unions-governor-to-sign-into-law-soon.php">Hawaii</a> [JURIST reports], and defines a civil union as "a legal union between two individuals of the same sex" who are consenting adults not party to a separate civil union or marriage. However, the civil unions bill passed with an amendment granting recognition exceptions to organizations that are or are connected to religious or denominational organizations. Pro-equality groups like <a href="http://www.marriageequalityri.org/">Marriage Equality Rhode Island</a> (MERI), <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/">Freedom to Marry</a> and the <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a> (GLAD) [advocacy websites] have condemned the law entirely because of this provision, which essentially allows many organizations to ignore a legally formed civil union. MERI Board Chair Martha Holt issued a statement after the bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rhode-island-senate-approves-civil-union-bill.php">passed the state Senate</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week:<blockquote>We are extremely disappointed that the Senate brazenly ignored the commonsense objections raised by equality and civil rights leaders here and across the country. This civil union bill contains dangerous and discriminatory language that, without question, will cause significant harm to countless gay and lesbian couples in loving, committed relationships, and we will continue to fight it through whatever means are necessary. Furthermore, we renew our request that the governor veto this hurtful and ill conceived bill. To not do so would be a slap in the face to the gay and lesbian community, and every Rhode Islander who cares about equal rights and protections for all our state's citizens.</blockquote>Chafee, as well as advocacy groups, <a href = "http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wrni/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1795388/news/Civil.Union.bill.disappoints.Chafee">initially called</a> [NPR report] for the legalization of <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=%22same-sex+marriage%22">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] but the House <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rhode-island-house-approves-civil-union-bill.php">did not approve the necessary amendment</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial and divisive issue throughout the US, although a recent <a href = "http://people-press.org/2011/03/03/fewer-are-angry-at-government-but-discontent-remains-high/">poll</a> [materials] suggests support for legalization is growing. New York recently became the nation's most populous state to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">pass a same-sex marriage bill</a> [JURIST report] while the <a href = "http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/">Minnesota Senate</a> [official website] in May <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-senate-approves-referendum-on-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">approved a voter referendum</a> [JURIST report] to amend the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In April, a Montana judge <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that had called for the state to provide legal status to same-sex relationships. Also in April, the <a href = "http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the state constitution that would ban same-sex marriage or any "substantially similar" status, and the <A href = "http://legisweb.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Senate</a> [official website] in February approved a bill that would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">void in Wyoming any same-sex marriages and civil unions</a> [JURIST report] performed in other jurisdictions. In addition to being legal in New York, same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <A href = "/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington, DC</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdeathpenalty.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] Friday filed an <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SG-amicus-in-Leal-execution-7-1-11.pdf"><em>amicus brief</em></a> [text, PDF] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in an attempt to stay the execution of Mexican national <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/">Humberto Leal Garcia</a> [advocacy website]. Leal Garcia's defense team filed a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/58930660?access_key=key-1dg0n5yfla13y5aboxs7"><em>writ of certiorari</em></a> [text] with the Supreme Court earlier this week. The Obama administration has serious concerns for how the execution could affect foreign policy since it would violate <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [text, PDF]. The DOJ argued Leal Garcia's execution would cause irreparable harm to relations with Mexico and violate the US's obligations under international law. The brief pointed particularly to the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice's</a> (ICJ) [official website] decision in <span class="casename">Case Concerning Avena &#38; Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.S.)</span>, where the ICJ held the US violated Article 36 by failing to inform consular authorities of 49 Mexican nationals in detention. The brief argued: <blockquote>Most immediately, petitioner's execution would result in serious damage to United States relations with Mexico. The United States' failure to comply with <span class="casename">Avena</span> has generated increasing concern by the Mexican government and thus posed an ever-greater obstacle to United States-Mexican relations. Those relations are enjoying an unprecedented level of cooperation but they are also unusually sensitive, so that a breach resulting from petitioner's execution would be particularly harmful. As explained in a letter to the Secretary of State from the Mexican Ambassador, the United States' continued non-compliance with the ICJ's decision has already placed great strain on [the] relationship between the United States and Mexico.</blockquote> Attached to the brief are letters of support for Leal Garcia from several nations, including Mexico, Chile, El Salvador, Honduras, Switzerland, Uruguay, as well as the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> [official website]. Although Leal Garcia's defense team filed for an overall review of his case in addition to the stay, the Obama administration seeks a delay of the execution until the <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/BillText-ConsularNotificationComplianceAct.pdf">Consular Notification Compliance Act</a> [text, PDF] passes, thus giving Leal Garcia an avenue to appeal his conviction as a violation of his consular rights. Stays of execution can be handled singularly by the Circuit Justice for that area, in this case, Justice Antonin Scalia. Typically, though, the Justice will bring the stay to the other eight justices for deliberation. Scalia is not expected to respond until Texas' government files an answer in the stay. Leal Garcia's execution is scheduled for July 7, which Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] has stated <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/07/us-texas-humberto-leal-execution">will go on as planned</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report].

<p>When Leal Garcia was arrested for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl, he was denied consular access, as required by Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. As a result, he was assigned a public aid attorney who had been sanctioned numerous times for ethical violations, which he contends caused his conviction. Further, the strongest evidence against him were statement he made when not in police custody, and also without access to the consulate. There was then a hearing in the ICJ, which <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/docs/Avena-Judgment-full-text.pdf">held</a> [judgment, PDF] that Leal Garcia was entitled to a hearing on the consular rights violation in his case. A Texas trial court differed, holding that because Leal Garcia was not in custody no one was required to contact the consulate. Last week, officials from the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-urges-texas-to-halt-execution.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] directly to Perry, alleging Leal Garcia did not receive a fair trial. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] wrote a personal letter to Perry asking for Leal Garcia's sentence to be commuted. Former president George W. Bush denounced the sentence when he was in office, issuing an <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/docs/Bush-memorandum.pdf">executive memoranda</a> [text, PDF] that Texas had to comply with the ICJ's ruling in approximately 50 Mexican nationals' planned executions. The Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/medvtex">Medellin v. Texas</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-rules-in-federally.php">report</a>], that Bush did not have the authority to direct a state court to comply with a ruling from the ICJ. However, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Congress could make the treaty binding in domestic law. Texas has already executed <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-second-foreign-national.php">two Mexican nationals</a> [JURIST report] who were denied consular access.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Throughout the proceedings, Mladic was hostile, gesturing to the crowd and refusing to enter a plea without lawyers of his choice representing him. The ICTY assigned Mladic a lawyer, Aleksander Aleksic, while Mladic wanted his Serbian lawyer Milos Saljic and Russian lawyer Aleksandr Mezayev to represent him. Judge Alphons Orie denied this request. Saljic has said that he <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/04/ratko-mladic-ejected-court">could not adequately represent Mladic</a> [Guardian report], because he does not speak English. As Orie attempted to read the charges, Mladic interrupted him and argued with the judge, contesting the court's legitimacy.

<p>Saljic <a href = "http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Disruptive-Mladic-removed-from-hearing-at-UN-court-1451528.php#ixzz1R92vFX3v">stated</a> [AP report] that Mladic's behavior is proof he is not fit to stand trial. Mladic, in arguing with Orie, also stated that "half his body is not working" and that his head was cold and he should be allowed to wear his cap. Orie said that since Mladic has not given the court appropriate medical information, he will not be given special allowances. A plea of not guilty was entered for Mladic. Orie has not set a date for Mladic's next hearing.</p>

<p>Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] last month at the ICTY, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. Before that, he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague late Tuesday night</a> [JURIST reports]. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for allegedly ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the massacre of Srebrenica during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two were <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/20/zine-el-abidine-ben-ali-former-tunisia-president-jail-sentence-_n_880696.html">sentenced to 35 years in prison</a> [Reuters report] and fined USD $65.6 million. Ben Ali's defense team asked for an adjournment to put together a defense and consult with their client, but their request was denied. One lawyer, Hosni Beji, said the charges were <A href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jFSPD-kWTZDYY8VGbk43UbnnwwHg?docId=CNG.0265cd9766a48297f8255d02da64b8df.d11">irrational</a> [AFP report] arguing a small amount of cannabis resin should not support charges of intention to sell it.

<p>Ben Ali fled Tunisia to Saudi Arabia in January during protests against his 23-year autocratic rule in which his <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE75J0MI20110620?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">family amassed substantial wealth</a> [Reuters report] that many Tunisians say was at their expense. But Ben Ali said that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=">he was "duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis, according to a statement released through his lawyer. He said that he was trying to get his family out of the country after assassination threats and that the plane left him in Saudi Arabia despite orders to wait for him. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges against him</a> [JURIST report] which stem mostly from allegations that he authorized the use of force against protesters during the Tunisian revolution, resulting in more than 200 deaths. <a href="http://www.businessnews.com.tn/details_article.php?t=525&amp;a=23107&amp;temp=1&amp;lang=">Justice Minister Lazhar Karoui Chebbi</a> [profile, in French] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-former-president.php">issuance of an arrest warrant</a> for Ben Ali in January, though the country has not received a response to its <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tunisia-calls-for-saudi-arabia-to-extradite-ousted-president.php">request to extradite</a> [JURIST reports] the former leader from Saudi Arabia, where he remains in exile.

He had <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2011/07/05/iran_jails_dissident_lawyer_for_9_years/">represented</a> [AP report] some of the activists involved in the protests following the disputed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. He was an associate of Nobel laureate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ebadi">Shirin Ebadi</a> [JURIST news archive] and co-founded the <a href="http://www.humanrights-ir.org/english/">Defenders of Human Rights Center</a> (DHRC) [advocacy website], an organization that issues regular reports about human rights violations in Iran. Dadkah was also fined for having a satellite TV receiver in his home. The conviction is seen as an attempt by the government to quell dissidents in light of protests across the Middle East. Fellow DHRC co-founders have been prosecuted for acting against the government. Iranian human rights lawyer Mohammed Seifzadeh was also sentenced to nine years in prison and a 10-year ban from practicing law for acting against national security in helping establish the DHRC. DHRC's co-founders, Nobel Prize winner Ebadi and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=soltani">Abdolfatah Soltani</a> [JURIST news archive] have been similarly charged.

<p>Dadkah was involved in some other high-profile cases. In 2007, he <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/iran-court-sentences-students-for.php">represented three university students students</a> [JURIST report] who were ultimately sentenced to two to three years in prison for insulting Islam and Islamic clerics. Iran continues to silence opposition leaders and dissidents.

In January, Iranian chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi delivered a speech at Tehran University indicating that he would prosecute opposition leaders for political unrest that took place after the country's 2009 presidential election. Dolatabadi <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/world/02iran.html?_r=1">threatened to prosecute</a> [NYT report] Mousavi and Karroubi and former Iranian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3027382.stm">Mohammad Khatami</a> [BBC profile]. Mousavi and the other leaders called for <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/iran-opposition-candidate-mousavi-calls.php">continuing protests</a> [JURIST report] to oppose the results of the 2009 presidential election, arguing that it was fraudulent.

The <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/multimedia/national/australian-evasion">documents</a> [text] show that Major George O'Kane worked closely with US authorities as a military lawyer and helped author the manual for processing prisoners. He also advised on the legality of interrogation methods and denied the Red Cross access to prisoners deemed by the US as "high value detainees." One document shows the O'Kane was part of the mission "Operation Eel" involving the transfer of a high-value detainee from a US warship to Abu Ghraib. The mission's <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/adf-knew-of-abuses-at-abu-ghraib-20110704-1gz95.html">timing was significant</a> [<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> report] because it coincided with the capture of Saddam Hussein. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre has called for a full government inquiry into Australia's involvement in the abuse and detention of detainees at Abu Ghraib. 

<p>Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] initiated a grand jury investigation into the torture and death of Manadel Al-Jamadi, a detainee at Abu Ghraib. In 2006, Australian television published additional <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/new-abu-ghraib-photos-shown-on.php">photographs</a> [JURIST report] and video depicting abuse of prisoners by US personnel at Abu Ghraib. The photographs drew <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/abu-ghraib-abuse-violated.php">criticism</a> from the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website], which said they showed clear violations of international humanitarian law. The Red Cross had previously criticized US practices at Abu Ghraib, saying that in some instances the <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/Sections/News/International%20News/Mideast%20and%20N.%20Africa/Iraq%20conflict/Red%20Cross%20report.pdf">abuse of Iraqi prisoners was "tantamount to torture"</a> [ICRC report, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2004/05/red-cross-report-said-us-abuses-of.htm">report</a>]. The original Abu Ghraib photographs led to the jailing of several US soldiers including <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/breaking-news-graner-found-guilty-in.php">Charles Graner</a> [JURIST report], who appears in some of the new images, and <a href="/currentawareness/england.php">Lynndie England</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Australian producer of SBS television's <em>Dateline</em> program <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060216/wl_mideast_afp/australiausiraqmilitaryprisonabuse_060216100214;_ylt=AsEyyHPJiRhTNazIq8smMc2FOrgF;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA">defended the decision to broadcast the photographs</a> [AFP report] and videos. Mike Carey dismissed criticism from the Pentagon that the pictures could increase the danger to American soldiers, saying that his team, as journalists, had a responsibility to air the images. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held the Netherlands liable for the deaths of three Bosnian Muslims, Bosiniaks, of about 5,000 who took refuge in a <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=S/Res/819(1993)">UN-designated "safe area"</a> [resolution materials] controlled by the Dutch battalion, Dutchbat, after then General <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/cis/en/cis_mladic_en.pdf">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY backgrounder, PDF; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>] invaded Srebrenica. Dutchbat <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14026218">forced the refugees to leave</a> [BBC report] the compound after which they were killed during the massacre. The court held that Dutchbat knew that men were being beaten and killed by the invading army and thus should reasonably have known that by forcing the men out of the compound it was putting them in grave danger. But court specified that the ruling only applies to the specific refugees in this case and that it was not making a broader ruling as to the liability for others killed at Srebrenica. The massacre resulted in the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys.

<p>Relatives of the victims <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/srebrenica-victims-file-complaint-against-dutch-peacekeepers.php">filed the complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the Dutch prosecutor's office in July 2010 alleging that three Dutch soldiers, operating as UN peacekeepers, were complicit in the commission of war crimes and genocide during the 1995 Srebrenica massacre. The complaint argued that the soldiers knew the victims would be killed if they were handed over to Serbian troops. Relatives of the victims of the Srebrenica massacre had previously sought justice for the actions of Dutch peacekeeping forces, which they say led to the massacre. In March, The Hague Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/dutch-court-upholds-un-immunity-for.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the UN's immunity from prosecution by <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/dutch-court-upholds-un-immunity-for.php">rejecting claims</a> [JURIST report] brought by relatives of victims of the massacre. The relatives, known as the Mothers of Srebrenica, alleged that the Netherlands should be liable for the deaths because Dutch soldiers operating under the UN flag negligently failed to protect civilians by forcing the victims out of "safe area" and turning them over to Bosnian Serbs. Ratko Mladic was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in May and is currently on trial in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] for charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. He was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">thrown out of his latest court appearance</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week for causing a disruption and refusing to issue a plea. </p>]]></content:encoded>

There is <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/2/8/15621/World/Region/Lebanon-opposition-demands-Mikati-back-UN-Hariri-c.aspx">debate over a policy statement</a> [AFP report] issued by Mikati on his support for the tribunal. Pro-Western opposition groups are pushing for stronger support from Mikati. MP Fuad Siniora, chairman of the <a href="http://www.almustaqbal.org/">Futures Bloc</a> [official website], issued a statement saying calling the policy statement a <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2011/Jul-02/Future-bloc-rules-out-confidence-vote-for-Cabinet.ashx#axzz1RFolMEjb">coup against the tribunal</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report]. The debate comes after the STL issued last week to Lebanese authorities an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-lebanon-tribunal-hands-down-sealed-indictment-in-hariri-assassination-case.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] with four arrest warrants against alleged members of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder] in relation to the assassination of former Lebanese prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4264359.stm">Rafik Hariri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">news archive</a>]. The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.

<p>In February, the appeals chamber of the STL issued a unanimous <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/News/Summary%20of%20Decision_16%20February%20(EN).pdf">ruling</a> [summary, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/sid/250">press release</a>] on several procedural issues, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-defines-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">including the definition of terrorism</a> [JURIST report], in judicial proceedings. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine which laws to apply in the case against persons accused of involvement in the February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. Using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Article 314 of the Lebanese Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF] the court held that a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger," that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case. In August, Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">submitted evidence to the STL</a> [JURIST report] linking Israel with the bombing. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">asked for the evidence</a> [JURIST report] a week earlier after Hezbollah Secretary General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile] claimed to have proof that Israel was behind the bombing. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Cairo Criminal Court <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/15651/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-court-clears-Mubaraks-ministers-of-inform.aspx">found three ministers not guilty</a> [<em>Al-Ahram</em> report]: Ahmed Maghrabi, former minister of housing, Yousef Boutros-Ghali, former minister of finance, and former minister of information Anas el-Fiqqi. The verdict is the first time former ministers of Mubarak have been found not guilty on corruption charges since the former president stepped down in February. The court did sentence former trade minister Rachid Mohammed Rachid <em>in absentia</em> for squandering public funds and profiteering. Maghrabu and Boutros-Ghali will remain in custody as they are facing other charges. The decision was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hF_3CbePBKnTPvj2SDvN9i-otklg?docId=dd76a80d62da45d2be7affd4cdcefffc">not well received by many Egyptians</a> [AP report] who feel that the Cairo criminal court is rushing corruption trials while failing to bring more cases for human rights abuses against protesters. A trial date for Mubarak was <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/egypt-to-try-mubarak-in-august.php">set</A> [JURIST report] for <a href = "http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/13429/Egypt/Politics-/Mubaraks-to-be-tried-on--August-for-corruption-and.aspx">August 3 at the Cairo Criminal Court</a> [MENA report].

<p>In May, an Egyptian criminal court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-court-convicts-former-tourism-minister-for-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] the country's former tourism minister, Zoheir Garranah, of corruption and sentenced him to five years in prison. In April, Egyptian prosecutors <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/former-egypt-officials-charged-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Boutros-Ghali, former prime minister Ahmed Nazif and former interior minister Habib el Adly with corruption. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused the former president</a> [JURIST report] and the country's police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations. The joint commission submitted their report to Egypt's top prosecutor for further investigation. The Supreme Military Council of Egypt, which assumed power after Mubarak's resignation, instructed Egypt's top prosecutor to <a href = "http://en.rian.ru/world/20110323/163161631.html">investigate the death of protesters</a> [RIA Novosti report] during the three weeks of demonstrations in the country.

The SBU is investigating UESU's potential embezzlement of USD $405 million from the government. Although the press release did not mention targeting Tymoshenko's time as head of the company, she stated the probe was another attempt to persecute her based on <a href = "http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/73154/">fake documents</a> [Interfax report]. Her <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-goes-on-trial-for-abuse-of-power.php">ongoing trial</a> includes charges of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/ukraine-ex-prime-minister-charged-with-abuse-of-office.php">abuse of office</a> in connection with signing gas import contracts with Russia, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ukraine-prosecutors-charge-ex-pm-tymoshenko-with-misusing-state-funds.php">misappropriating state funds</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ukraine-prosecutors-launch-new-investigation-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">abuse of authority</a> [JURIST reports] by purchasing "1000 Opel Combo" medical vans at a 20 percent mark-up during her time as prime minister from 2007-2010. Tymoshenko expressed confidence that a new probe indicates those cases against her have collapsed.

<p>Last month, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], alleging violations of the <A href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. ECHR President Jean Paul Costa <a href = "http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/1235011-v-espch-ne-kommentiruyut-perspektivu-iskov-timoshenko-k-ukraine">refused to comment on the complaint</a> [Korrespondent report, in Russian], but said it was before the court. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontrussia2.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] said that the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in pre-trial was the result of criminal acts, differing from the previous explanation that had blamed prison doctors. Medvedev was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joyDWZOSrwmRBeOTY6QCVe0mWk-w?docId=CNG.9dbab75e3418bf50a4b7b8244b8b6207.2a1">presented with a report</a> [AFP report] on Magnitsky's death during a <a href="http://kremlin.ru/news/11838">meeting</a> [press release, in Russian] with the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights that said Magnitsky was beaten to death by prison guards before his death. An investigation into the death had explained the death as a denial of health care. Magnitsky was arrested on allegations of tax fraud after implicating Russian police in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal, while working as outside counsel for the London-based investment fund <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Management</a> [corporate website]. He was held in detention without a trial for over a year before he  officials. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/russia-lawyer-death-prompts-criticism.php">died</a> [JURIST report] in a Moscow prison in November 2009. The report says that there were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/06/us-russia-lawyer-death-idUSTRE76521120110706">serious conflicts of interest</a> [Reuters report] with the investigation of Magnitsky since the investigators were the same ones against whom he testified in the embezzlement scandal. Magnitsky's pre-trial death is a blow to Medvedev's desire for <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/russia-president-medvedev-says-lack-of-commitment-to-rule-of-law-holding-country-back.php">legal and judicial reform</a> [JURIST report] and Russia's commitment to the rule of law. 

<p>Prior to his death, Magnitsky was held in prison for 358 days with little to no access to legal representation, his family or medical professionals. In February, the Council began investigating Magnitsky's death and the verdicts handed down against former Russian oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] and his business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website]. The Council's goal is to submit to Medvedev, "expert legal analysis in connection with specific cases causing public outcry or defining trend of judicial practice." The Council began its work shortly after a group of independent UN human rights experts started its own investigation into the circumstances around Magnitsky's death. Last year, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/us-lawmakers-seek-to-ban-visas-for-russia-officials-linked-to-lawyers-death.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] from issuing visas to individuals, or their family members, who are connected to Magnitsky's death. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Thomas Thrash issued a preliminary injunction for the plaintiffs&#8212;the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] and other rights groups&#8212;last week. Thrash granted the injunction request for sections 7 and 8 of HB 87, saying that the plaintiffs would face irreparable harm should the law take effect and that the public interest weighed in favor of issuing the injunction. The bill, which was scheduled to take effect on July 1, allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. The law also imposes fines and prison sentences of up to one year for anyone who knowingly transports illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the immigration status of potential employees, providing that workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment could face up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Georgia's appeal will be filed within the week in the <a href = "http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>The Georgia suit does not mark the first time the ACLU and other groups have taken legal action against immigration laws in recent months. Last month, the ACLU filed a class action suit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">challenging an Indiana immigration law</a> [JURIST report] that requires individuals to provide proof of their legal status at all times and calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only. Also last month, the ACLU and other groups filed a class action suit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">against a Utah immigration law</a> [JURIST report] that requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. Federal judges have enjoined both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-enjoins-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">Utah</a> laws [JURIST reports]. Similar legislation has been approved in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports]. Arizona's legislation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law last April</a>, is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">enjoined</a>, and Governor Jan Brewer has <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-ask-supreme-court-to-lift-injunction-on-controversial-immigration-law.php">pledged to appeal to the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI said that its investigation revealed that during a security sweep in Tell Kalakh beginning May 14, security forces conducted killings, mass arrests, arbitrary detentions and torture forcing many to flee across the border to Lebanon. AI said it was unable to gain access to Syria but interviewed families who had fled to Lebanon. AI said that every family it interviewed had at least one family member in detention. The report said:<blockquote>On the basis of this and other research, Amnesty International considers that the Syrian army and security forces committed crimes and other violations during the security operation in Tell Kalakh that, when taken in the context of other crimes and human rights violations elsewhere in Syria, amount to crimes against humanity. This is because they appear to be part of a widespread, as well as systematic, attack against the civilian population involving multiple commission of a range of crimes against a multiplicity of victims in an organized manner and pursuant to a state policy to commit such an attack. These crimes include murder, torture, arbitrary detention and other severe deprivation of liberty, and other inhumane acts committed intentionally to cause great suffering or serious damage to mental or physical health.</blockquote>Human rights investigators have been shut out of Syria, including a UN commission that <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">published a preliminary report</a> [JURIST report] alleging Syrian security forces have used live ammunition against unarmed civilians, arbitrarily detained protestors, and tortured and killed over 1,000 people. The report also calls for further investigation into violence in Syria.

<p>Earlier this month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said that the recent wave of Middle East and North African protests and revolutions showed a basic need for human rights. Pillay pointed to the efforts of the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in these conflict areas: fact finding missions in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-to-probe-gaddafi-over-libya-torture-allegations.php">Libya</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-human-rights-council-to-investigate-human-rights-abuses-in-ivory-coast.php">Ivory Coast</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">Syria</a> [JURIST report] and country offices created in Tunisia and Egypt. There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. In June, Syrian and international human rights groups urged the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the hundreds of civilian deaths during protests against Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], in an emergency special session in April, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4dbfe77d2.pdf">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">report</a>] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">called for Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also in April, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests continue. Earlier in the same month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">stopped medical personnel</a> [JURIST report], sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] in March to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, released last week, indicated that most of the attacks were committed by the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/fdlr.htm">Democratic Liberation Force of Rwanda</a> (FDLR), but some were also perpetrated by the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/mayi-mayi.htm">Mai Mai</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounders] and followers of army deserter Emmanuel Nsengiyumva, all Congolese rebel groups. The report describes the rapes as systematic and clearly used as a strategic tactic in the conflict:<blockquote>In view of the consistent statements that were collected, the team can conclude that at least 387 civilians were raped, including 300 women, 23 men, 55 girls, and 9 boys during the attack on villages along the Kibua-Mpofi axis. It is highly likely that the number of victims is higher, as some victims did not come forward for the reasons given in paragraph 5 of this report. According to local sources, the attacks were a punitive strike intended to subjugate local communities living along the Kibua-Mpofi axis, considered as "traitors" for reportedly sympathizing with Government forces, and aimed at equipping the coalition of armed groups. The armed groups allegedly decided to scare them forever through extremely humiliating acts, hence the planning of mass rapes. According to the statement of a local victim from the Nianga ethnic group, "It is better to die than being raped by FDLR and their allies, because such rape is the worst humiliation against a human being."</blockquote>MONUSCO declared that  the rapes could be war crimes as well as crimes against humanity and recommended further judicial action and more investigation. In February, a military court found Lt Col Kibibi Mutware <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/drc-colonel-sentenced-to-20-years-imprisonment-for-mass-rapes.php">guilty of involvement in mass rapes</a> [JURIST report] that took place on New Year's Day and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment, dismissing him from the military. This has been the only action taken on the issue.

<p>DRC has been struggling with a number of human rights issues. Last month, a military court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/congo-court-sentences-4-to-death-for-rights-activist-murder.php">sentenced four policemen to death</a> for killing prominent human rights activist Floribert Chebeya last year. In early October, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">called for the DRC government</a> [JURIST report] to arrest general Bosco Ntaganda pursuant to an outstanding warrant for war crimes issued by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Earlier that same week French authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-authorities-arrest-drc-war-crimes-suspect-under-icc-warrant.php">arrested a leader</a> [JURIST report] of the FDLR for crimes committed by that group in the DRC. In October, UN peacekeeping forces and the DRC government <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-forces-arrest-rebel-leader-for-drc-mass-rapes.php">arrested Mai Mai Cheka</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly leading a rebel group responsible for mass rapes in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="https://ecf.idd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Idaho</a> [official website] has issued a <a href="http://media.spokesman.com/documents/2011/07/prelim-inj-7-5-11.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [ruling text, PDF] blocking the enforcement of an Idaho anti-union <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1007.pdf">law</a> [SB 1007] that bans a union program that subsidizes employment for its members. The law, called the Fairness in Contracting Act, prohibits union programs used by construction workers unions that pool portions of union wages on a voluntary basis to subsidize union labor to enable union members to be hired at the collectively bargained salary. The plaintiffs, Idaho Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO and Southwest Idaho Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO, representing building tradesmen use such a system to keep the cost of using union workers competitive with non-union laborers. Idaho passed the law pursuant to the federal Right to Work Act which Congress has explicitly exempted from the preemption by federal law. But the unions argued that that the Fairness in Contracting Act was beyond the Right to Work Act conflicting with collective bargaining rights and preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Judge B Lynn Winmill agreed:<blockquote>Time and time again, the Supreme Court has reiterated that the NLRB should serve as the principal arbiter of labor disputes. Thus the Court sees no justification for a court to abandon consideration of the threshold question, which is whether the matter at issue is peripheral to the concerns of the NLRA or a matter of particular local concern. This would require the Court to discard more than half a century of federal policy that places exclusive jurisdiction over issues of national labor relations in the hands of the agency created by Congress to deal with them. Absent more explicit direction from Congress or the Supreme Court, the Court sees no reason to do so.</blockquote>The Fairness in Contracting Act was passed with heavy Republican support <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2011/07/06/1716432/federal-judge-to-idaho-anti-union.html">despite warnings</a> [AP report] from the <a href="http://www.ag.idaho.gov/index.html">Idaho Attorney General's office</a> [official website] that it was based on shaky legal ground. It was set to take effect on July 1.

<p>Anti-union fervor has been spreading among state legislatures. Last month, 10 Wisconsin unions filed a lawsuit in the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] challenging the state's new collective bargaining law. The lawsuit alleges that the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11 text, PDF] violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [texts]. According to the plaintiffs, the bill discriminates among groups of public employees and eliminates basic union rights, like bargaining, organizing and associating. Phil Neuenfeldt, president of <a href="http://www.wisaflcio.org/">Wisconsin State AFL-CIO</a> [official website], condemned Wisconsin <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] for implementing the law and described the law as unconstitutional: "Not only have Scott Walker and his deep-pocketed corporate allies sought to silence the voices of Wisconsin workers, they have also violated those workers constitutional rights."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Among those charged is the head of the rebel group the <a href = "http://www.ntclibya.com/">National Transition Council</a> [official website]. Khalifa plans to try the 21 suspects <em>in absentia</em> in a closed trial before a panel of three judges, and then seek international arrest warrants through <a href = "http://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a> [official website]. He did not comment on whether the recent <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi and two of his high-ranking officials would be honored. If convicted, the rebels will likely receive the death penalty.

<p>Earlier in June, ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] presented the materials to Pre-Trial Chamber. He said his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">gathered "direct evidence"</a> [JURIST report] that shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protestors and that his forces used live ammunition on crowds, attacked civilians in their homes, used heavy weapons against people in funeral processions and placed snipers to shoot those leaving mosques after prayer services. Moreno-Ocampo announced last month that his office was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">pursuing arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi and the two others in his "inner circle." He said al-Islam was acting as Gaddafi's "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister" and called al-Sanussi Gaddafi's "right-hand man" and "executioner." At that time, Moreno-Ocampo said his office was almost prepared for trial, having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes and human rights violations over the Libyan revolt which has persisted since February. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Obama administration has brought Somali terror suspect Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame to the US to face a civil trial in New York, a decision that has sparked harsh criticism. Warsame was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/07/05/somali.terror.suspect/">captured by US forces in April</a> [CNN report] somewhere in the Gulf region and detained on a US Navy ship for questioning until being sent to the US for trial. He made an appearance on Tuesday in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York where he pleaded not guilty to charges of providing material support to a terrorist group and conspiring to teach and demonstrate how to make explosives. The decision to bring Warsame to the US suggests how the Obama administration will handle other terror suspects captured outside Iraq and Afghanistan. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] lauded the decision but questioned the long detainment overseas. Hina Shamsi of the ACLU released a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-supports-moving-terror-suspect-us-court-questions-unlawful-military-detention">statement</a> [text]:<blockquote>We welcome the announcement that the Obama administration will prosecute Warsame in the criminal justice system. Unlike the discredited military commissions, federal courts are able to achieve justice and unquestionably have jurisdiction over the material support and conspiracy crimes with which Warsame is charged. But the Obama administration has put a criminal conviction at risk by holding Warsame in unlawful military detention for over two months. The government could have obtained intelligence through law enforcement rather than military interrogation, as it successfully has in hundreds of terrorism cases, without jeopardizing its criminal case. We are deeply concerned that the Obama administration continues to assert a worldwide war authority wherever terrorism suspects are found, and it is incumbent upon Congress to impose necessary and wise limitations on the administration.</blockquote>Senate Minority Leader <a href="http://mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Home">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) [official website] criticized the decision to bring Warsame to the US for trial arguing that terror suspects should be held in Guantanamo Bay. He made a state on the Senate floor Wednesday denouncing the move: <blockquote>It is truly astonishing that this administrations is determined&#8212;determined&#8212;to give foreign fighters all the rights and privileges of US citizens, regardless of where they are captured. ... It has become abundantly clear that the administration has no intention of utilizing Guantanamo unless an enemy combatant is already being held there. Instead, the administration has purposefully imported a terrorist into the US and is providing him of all the rights of a US citizen in court. This ideological rigidity being displayed by the administration is harming the national security of the United States of America.</blockquote>

<p>US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">consistently advocated</a> [JURIST report] that terror suspects should be tried in civilian courts despite finding little support from Congress. Last month, Holder gave a speech defending the civil court system for terror suspects saying he will, "defend the exclusive right of the executive branch to determine appropriate venues and mechanisms for all criminal trials," and that he will, " continue to point&#8212;one indisputable fact ... proven repeatedly by this administration and the previous one: in disrupting potential attacks and effectively interrogating, prosecuting, and incarcerating terrorists, there is quite simply, no more powerful tool than our civilian court system." In April, Holder announced that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder, who wanted the accused be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report], referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US. Holder refused to delay the trial any longer for the sake of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families, explaining that the restrictions are not likely to be repealed in the immediate future. The Obama administration changed its position despite repeated appeals from rights groups to utilize civilian courts over military commissions for the trials of suspected terrorists. However, international pressure to use civilian courts remains. Last March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">hold civilian trials</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and other suspected terrorists saying that the military commissions system is fatally flawed and cannot be reformed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontun.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Women around the world are still facing discrimination, according to a <a href = "http://progress.unwomen.org/pdfs/EN-Report-Progress.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href = "http://progress.unwomen.org/">materials</a>] released Wednesday by <a href = "http://unwomen.org/">UN Women</a> [official website] detailing the legal and humanitarian struggles of women across the globe. The report, "Progress of the World's Women: In Pursuit of Justice," is the first out of the UN's new agency, which is devoted to reducing gender inequalities around the world. Part of the report examined how, internationally, the rule of law discriminates against women:<blockquote>[F]or millions of women and girls, the reality is that the rule of law means little in practice. While law is intended to be a neutral set of rules to govern society, in all countries of the world, laws tend to reflect and reinforce the privilege and the interests of the powerful, whether on the basis of economic class, ethnicity, race, religion or gender. Justice systems also reflect these power imbalances. In all societies, women are less powerful than men and the two areas in which women's rights are least protected, where the rule of law is weakest and men's privilege is often most entrenched, are first, women's rights in the private and domestic sphere, including their rights to live free from violence and to make decisions about their sexuality, on marriage, divorce and reproductive health; and second, women's economic rights, including the right to decent work and the right to inherit and control land and other productive resources. There are challenges at every stage, starting with legal frameworks. In some cases, laws overtly discriminate against women, according them fewer rights than men. Examples of this include laws that limit women's rights within the family, or those that prohibit women from passing on their citizenship to their husband or children, impacting on their civil and political rights, and access to public services. In other cases, the protection of the rule of law is not extended to the private domain where millions of women work and where they are most likely to experience violence.</blockquote>The report made a number of recommendations for governments to better work toward equality: supporting women's legal associations, implementing gender-sensitive reform, reducing attrition in the justice chain, putting women in more positions of power in law enforcement, training judges in gender sensitivity and monitor their decisions, increasing women's access to judicial processes, implementing gender-responsive reparations programs and using quotas to boost the number of women legislators.

<p>Equality and women's rights continue to be an issue for much of the world.  UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/women/rapporteur/docs/RashidaManjoo.doc">Special Rapporteur Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile, DOC] released a report last month that said there is a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">continued prevalence of violence and discriminatory treatment of women in the US</a> [JURIST report], with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. In March, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-tunisia-egypt-to-protect-womens-rights.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Tunisia and Egypt on Tuesday to ensure that women's rights receive constitutional protection and to include women in the dialogue to shape the future of their countries. In January, a US Military panel <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/military-commission-recommends-allowing-women-to-serve-in-direct-military-combat.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that women should be allowed to serve on the front lines of combat. Last year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/afghanistan-government-must-protect-women's-rights-during-reconciliation-efforts:-hrw.php">called on the Afghan government to protect the rights of women</a> [JURIST report] during integration and reconciliation efforts conducted with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/taleban.htm">Taliban</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and other militants. Earlier in 2010, India's upper house of parliament, the <a href="http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rsweb.asp">Rajya Sabha</a> [official website], <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/india-upper-house-approves-quota-for.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that one-third of seats in parliament are reserved for women. The <a href="http://www.esocialsciences.com/data/articles/Document12472008550.2347834.pdf">Women's Reservation Bill</a> [2008 text, PDF] increased the number of women serving in the 543-seat legislature, which currently has no gender quota, from 59 to at least 181.</p>]]></content:encoded>

USA</a> [case materials], ordering an immediate end to enforcement of the military's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell"</a> (DADT) policy [10 USC &#167; 654 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don't+ask+don't+tell">news archive</a>], due to the Obama administration's assertion that it is <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. This decision comes after the Ninth Circuit's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-declines-to-put-dont-ask-dont-tell-appeal-on-hold.php">denial</a> [JURIST report] of a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/03/10-56813_Abeyance.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] by the US government that the court suspend the government's appeal of an <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-orders-military-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Central District of California</a> [official website] requiring the US military to end enforcement of DADT. In November, the government requested and received a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/11/01/10-56634_order_granting_stay.pdf">stay</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] that suspended enforcement of the injunction. The government requested that the appeal be placed on hold in light of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [text and materials], arguing that moving forward with the appeal would interfere with the repeal schedule that the Act sets in place. After hearing seven months worth of arguments and briefs, the Ninth Circuit rejected this appeal and released the stay.<blockquote>Appellee/cross-appellant's motion to lift this court's November 1, 2010, order granting a stay of the district court's judgment pending appeal is granted. In their briefs, appellants/cross-appellees do not contend that 10 USC &#167; 654 is constitutional. In addition, in the context of the Defense of Marriage Act, 1 USC &#167; 7, the United States has recently taken the position that classifications based on sexual orientation should be subjected to heightened scrutiny. Appellants/cross-appellees state that the process of repealing Section 654 is well underway, and the preponderance of the armed forces are expected to have been trained by mid-summer. The circumstances and balance of hardships have changed, and appellants/cross-appellees can no longer satisfy the demanding standard for issuance of a stay.</blockquote>Neither of the original parties to the suit, the Obama administration nor the <a href = "http://www.logcabin.org/site/c.nsKSL7PMLpF/b.5468093/k.BE4C/Home.htm">Log Cabin Republicans</a> [advocacy website], have commented on the decision.

<p>In May, the US House of Representatives passed the $690 billion <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.1540:">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> [HR 1540 materials], which contains a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c112:2:./temp/~c112lBmZpg:e286772:">provision</a> [Sec. 533] that would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/us-house-passes-690-billion-defense-authorization-bill.php">delay the repeal of DADT</a> [JURIST report]. The repeal had reportedly been <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/military-training-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-to-be-complete-midsummer.php">on track</a> [JURIST report] to be completed by midsummer. The provision would require the chiefs of each military branch to provide written certification that the repeal of DADT be harmful to the "readiness, effectiveness, cohesion, and morale" of armed forces units. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved in the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/topstoryphoto/frontryan.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] An appeals court on Wednesday rejected convicted former Illinois governor George Ryan's appeal seeking to overturn his 2006 conviction on corruption charges. The 77-year-old Ryan was <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/breaking-news-former-illinois-governor.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 on multiple counts of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2003/warner_ryan.pdf">corruption and fraud</a> [indictment, PDF] in connection with a bribes-for-licenses scandal that occurred during Ryan's term as Illinois Secretary of State. Ryan appealed his conviction after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1394">Skilling v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-holds-publicity-did-not-prevent-fair-trial-in-enron-case.php">report</a> ] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001346----000-.html">"honest services" doctrine</a> [18 USC &#167; 1346 text] is not unconstitutionally vague when construed narrowly. Ryan brought a collateral attack arguing that he was convicted under pre-<span class="casename">Skilling</span> jury instructions, and under this new "honest services" precedent, he should be released from prison and his convictions for mail fraud and for violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Rackteer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 <em>et seq.</em>] should be thrown out. But Judge Frank Hoover Easterbrook held, "there is no doubt that a properly instructed jury <em>could</em> have deemed the payments bribes or kickbacks; the inference that they were verges on the inescapable. The district court's opinion canvasses the evidence and demonstrates why a reasonable jury could find that Ryan sold his offices to the high bidders." Last year, District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/illinois-ex-governor-ryan-appeals-conviction-following-honest-services-ruling.php">rejected</a> Ryan's appeal holding that the different instructions were harmless error.

<p>Illinois has two convicted former governors as <a href="http://www.thepublicityagency.com/rod-blagojevich/index.htm">Rod Blagojevich</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blagojevich">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-convicted-on-corruption-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on 17 of 20 counts including attempting to sell or trade the US Senate seat vacated by President Barack Obama. Blagojevich had also tried to cite <span class ="casename">Skilling</span>, but a district judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/blagojevich-judge-refuses-to-delay-trial-after-supreme-court-honest-services-ruling.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] to delay the trial. In 2008, Ryan <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-illinois-governor-ryan-issues.php">issued his first public apology</a> [JURIST report] for the crimes that resulted in his imprisonment. Ryan was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-illinois-governor-sentenced-to.php">sentenced in 2007</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/former-illinois-governor-heads-to.php">jailed</a> [JURIST reports] on corruption charges. Ryan's <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/ex-illinois-governor-heading-to-trial.php">trial</a> began in 2005, and, in 2006, a jury found him <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/breaking-news-former-illinois-governor.php">guilty</a> [JURIST reports] on multiple counts of <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/indict/2003/warner_ryan.pdf">corruption and fraud</a> [indictment, PDF] in connection with a bribes-for-licenses scandal that occurred during Ryan's term as Illinois Secretary of State. Ryan made national headlines and won praise in some quarters in January 2003 when, just before leaving office, he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2649125.stm">commuted the executions</a> [BBC report] of all Illinois inmates then on death row.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hani al-Majali, the delegation's head, <a href="http://sabanews.net/en/news243457.htm">warned of the potential crisis</a> [<em>SABA</em> report] during a press conference after meeting with Yemeni officials to discuss the findings of the delegation's 10-day mission to the country. Al-Majali said that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hctSQ3X6Q1d0D85ZW1jusUgOS1GQ?docId=CNG.400d0f07f2d2e0899ef48311491aa56c.871">Yemeni people are suffering</a> [AFP report] as a result of political violence and conflict in the country, which he stated has negatively impacted the economy, education, medical services, employment and the ability to transport food to rural areas of the country. He said peaceful protests should continue but warned that the government's use of excessive force could cause the protests to escalate into violence. Al-Majai called for international aid to avoid a crisis situation and reminded government officials that any form of punishment due to the country's ongoing power struggle violates international laws. The delegation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-investigators-to-asses-yemen-human-rights-situation.php">sent to Yemen late last month</a> [JURIST report] to gather information about the country's human rights situation by meeting with officials, civilians, members of opposition groups, religious leaders and victims of rights violations. An official report on the delegation's visit is <a href="http://sabanews.net/en/news243450.htm">expected to be released in August</a> [<em>SABA</em> report].

<p>The delegation's investigation comes as many rights groups have criticized Yemen for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have persisted since February. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] in April urging the international community to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate protestor deaths. Just days earlier, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-yemen-to-halt-use-of-force-against-protesters.php">urged the Yemeni government</a> [JURIST report] to stop using force against peaceful protesters. The Yemeni Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">enacted several emergency measures</a> [JURIST report] in March at the request of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic] in an effort to end anti-government protests. Saleh, who <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down in April</a> [JURIST report], and his party, the General People's Congress (GPC), had caused mounting political tensions due to attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand their political power. In December, the parliament stoked outrage among opposition parties and independents when it <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipKDkB5w7UaeP0M9e8bZ1XdjZokQ?docId=CNG.9eab6633bebd069b5f0a3ec51e79b6e5.b51">amended the constitution</a> [AFP report] to eliminate provisions requiring that opposition parties be represented on the high election commission.

Upholding the <a href = "http://www.brennancenter.org/page/-/d/download_file_36365.pdf">injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] issued by the <a href = "http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website], the court agreed that the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode22/usc_sup_01_22_10_83.html">US Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003</a> [22 USC &#167; 7601 text] violates free speech with Section 7631(f): "[n]o funds made available to carry out this Act ... may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution." The court ruled that this unconstitutionally requires potential fund recipients to "espouse the government's views."<blockquote>Furthermore, the targeted speech, concerning prostitution in the context of the international HIV/AIDS-prevention effort, is a subject of international debate. The right to communicate freely on such matters of public concern lies at the heart of the First Amendment. The Policy Requirement offends that principle, mandating that Plaintiffs affirmatively espouse the government's position on a contested public issue where the differences are both real and substantive. For example, the World Health Organization ("WHO") and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS ("UNAIDS") have recognized advocating for the reduction of penalties for prostitution&#8212;to prevent such penalties from interfering with outreach efforts&#8212;as among the best practices for HIV/AIDS prevention. Plaintiffs claim that being forced to declare their opposition to prostitution "harms [their] credibility and integrity as NGOs, which generally avoid taking controversial policy positions likely to offend host nations [and] partner organizations," and risks "offending all of the groups whose approach to HIV/AIDS may differ from that of the government," not to mention some of the very people, prostitutes, "whose trust they must earn to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS."</blockquote>The plaintiffs, Alliance for Open Society International and <A href = "http://www.pathfind.org/site/PageServer">Pathfinder International</a> [advocacy website] are both international nonprofit organizations working to eradicate HIV/AIDS. Their attorney, Rebekah Diller, was <a href = "http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202499513882&AntiProstitution_Pledge_Violates_Speech_Rights_Circuit_Finds&slreturn=1&hbxlogin=1">pleased with the decision</a> [<em>New York Law Journal</em> report], saying that it allows the organization to spend funding the most effective way they can.

<p>Prostitution is controversial across the globe. Last month, a five-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Ontario Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/ontario-court-extends-stay-upholding-anti-prostitution-laws-until-court-ruling.php">extended a stay of a lower court decision</a> [JURIST report] striking down laws banning prostitution-related activities, leaving the activities illegal pending ruling of the court. Although prostitution is legal in Canada, virtually all of the acts ancillary to exchanging sex for money are not. In September, the classified advertising website <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist</a> [website] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/craigslist-removes-adult-services-section-under-pressure-from-state-ags.php">removed its "adult services" section</a> [JURIST report] in the US, replacing it with a "censored" label after 18 state attorneys general criticized the section in a <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/cwp/view.asp?A=2341&Q=464992">letter</a> [text] sent last month. The letter, written by Connecticut <a href="http://www.ct.gov/ag/site/default.asp">Attorney General Richard Blumenthal</a> [official website] and joined by the attorneys general of 17 other states, called on Craigslist to remove the section due to alleged "rampant prostitution advertisements" and because it is supposedly used to facilitate human trafficking of women and children. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Samsung claimed that Apple <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-30/samsung-novozymes-microsoft-prince-intellectual-property.html">violated five patents</a> [Bloomberg report] also related to smartphones and tablets.

In <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Al-Skeini%20%7C%20Others%20%7C%20v.%20%7C%20the%20%7C%20United%20%7C%20Kingdom&sessionid=73253529&skin=hudoc-en">Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom</a> [judgment text] the ECHR held that the UK's assumption of authority for security and maintenance gave it a duty to uphold human rights under Article 1 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] and that the UK's failure to properly investigate the deaths of civilians killed during operations violated that duty. The case was brought on behalf six Iraqi civilians killed by British soldiers during the UK's occupation of Iraq from May 1, 2003, to June 28, 2004. Normally, the Convention only applies to actions within a nation's own borders, but the ECHR said that jurisdiction extended to Iraq since the UK was an occupying power. It further held that the failure to properly investigate the deaths constituted a violation of the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention. In the second case, <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=Al-Jedda%20%7C%20v.%20%7C%20the%20%7C%20United%20%7C%20Kingdom&sessionid=73256285&skin=hudoc-en">Al-Jedda v. the United Kingdom</a> [judgment text], the ECHR ruled that the detention of a dual Iraqi-British citizen for three years in Iraq detention facility at Basrah City violated Article 5's right to liberty and security. 

<p>The ECHR's ruling to apply UK jurisdiction to Iraq could have far reaching implications for European nations' human rights obligations during operations abroad. Last year, the UK <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_1">1998 Human Rights Act</a>, which incorporates the Convention into English law, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-supreme-court-rules-no-human-rights-protections-for-soldiers-abroad.php">does not apply to armed forces on foreign soil</a> [JURIST report] and that a soldier's family does not have an automatic right to an investigation into cause of death in the battlefield. The case involved Private Jason Smith, who died of heat stroke in Iraq after making several complaints to his commanding officers. Smith's mother filed suit against the government, claiming that the UK owed her son a duty to respect his right to life, which was protected by Article 2 of the Convention, and that the government must launch an investigation into the alleged breach of that right. The UK Court of Appeal held that Smith had been protected by the Human Rights Act at all times and ordered a new investigation. The Supreme Court overruled the decision, holding that the act does not extend to troop operations abroad. The court held that, since Smith died outside of the UK's Iraqi army base, he was on foreign soil and was not protected by human rights. Justice Lord Alan Rodger noted that the lower court's ruling would require the government to protect soldiers from risks caused by conflict or face potentially costly lawsuits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Seselj <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/125075134.html">entered his not guilty plea</a> [AP report] at his initial appearance before the Trial Chamber in The Hague. The Trial Chamber filed an <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/contempt_seselj3/ind/en/110524.pdf">order in lieu of an indictment</a> [text, PDF] in May against Seselj for his failure to comply with a May 9 order to remove from his website <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/index.php?c=10">three books he authored</a> and five <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/index.php?c=11">confidential filings</a> [defense website] that reveal the identities of protected witnesses who testified against him.

Seselj's war crimes trial, which began in 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/icty-resumes-seselj-trial-after-delay.php">resumed in early 2010</a>, after <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">being delayed</a> [JURIST reports] for nearly a year over fears that witnesses were being intimidated. In February, Seselj <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icty-begins-contempt-trial-over-witness-identity-revelations.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] on charges that he released the names of 11 ICTY witnesses in violation of a confidentiality order. Last May, the ICTY appeals division <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icty-upholds-contempt-conviction-of-serb-nationalist-leader.php">upheld</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-convicts-seselj-of-contempt-for.php">2009 contempt verdict</a> [JURIST reports] against Seselj for revealing the identities of other witnesses that were supposed to remain confidential. Seselj is accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the SRS, which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mpambara, a former member of extremist Hutu militia <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/interahamwe.htm">Interahamwe</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], which was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Tutsis, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/rwanda-hutu-convicted-in-netherlands.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of torture in 2009 and sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Dutch national court in agreement with the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist_search.php?q=INTERNATIONAL+CRIMINAL+TRIBUNAL+FOR+RWANDA">news archive</a>]. He was arrested in the Netherlands and accused of attacking a church, kidnapping, torture, and the murder of two mothers and their four children in Rwanda. The appeals court <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/125152694.html">upheld</a> [AP report] his conviction and convicted him on additional war crimes charges. Mpambara's brother, Georges Rutaganda, former vice president of the Interahamwe, was convicted of genocide by the ICTR. He <a href="https://appablog.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/ictr-press-release-death-of-convict-georges-rutaganda-in-benin/">died last year</a> [ICTR press release] in prison.

<p>The Dutch court decision comes weeks after the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-ex-military-chief-bizimungu-3-others.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan army chief Augustin Bizimungu and three others involved the Rwandan genocide.

The court found Hategekimana guilty of three counts of genocide stemming from his involvement in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, specifically in the massacre of civilian Tutsis in the Rwandan town of Butare. Three months ago, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ictr-removes-us-defense-lawyer-from-tribunal-work.php">removed</a> US lawyer and JURIST <a href="/forum/">Forum</a> [website] contributor <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> [professional profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=erlinder">news archive</a>] from his position as an ICTR defense lawyer.

Stressing the importance of rebuilding after Haiti's recent earthquake, Kang said reform must create a new focus on human rights and equality in the nation. A major point of this is trying Duvalier, but Kang also alluded to the possibility of trying Duvalier on an international level.<blockquote>Impunity for past violations remains a major concern. In January of this year, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, reminded the Haitian authorities of their obligation to investigate the serious human rights violations that took place during the rule of Jean Claude Duvalier, and for which no statute of limitations exists under international law. Today, I reiterate the High Commissioner's offer of support and technical assistance to the authorities of Haiti and I hope to work with the new authorities in this regard. In addition to the judicial process, I fully support the initiative to establish a Truth Commission. I hope it will thoroughly examine this period of Haitian history as well as others, promote memory and reconciliation, and raise awareness of the need to protect and promote human rights, particularly among young persons.</BLOCKQUOTE>More than <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hDG8IqnpT_sMI_gaLRTvoowOkoog?docId=7d843ad062da4c12a348d832e92b3a0f">20 criminal suits have been filed against Duvalier</a> [AP report], but the case is reportedly moving slowly, with Duvalier only undergoing questioning sessions before a judge. His defense attorney asserted that the statute of limitations in Haiti has expired and that Duvalier should be a free citizen. Duvalier is currently under house arrest.

<p>Duvalier, also known as "Baby Doc," is the son of former Haitian leader Francois Duvalier, or "Papa Doc," whom he <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/22/newsid_2525000/2525501.stm">succeeded as leader</a> [BBC report] in 1971. Following a tumultuous reign, which included accusations of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2003/07/01/some-alleged-torturers-living-exile">thousands of murders by his regime</a> [HRW report], Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986, and had since resided in France, until his return to Haiti in January. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-to-probe-alleged-rights-violations-by-former-dictator-report.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Haitian authorities will <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/haiti-authorities-commit-investigation-jean-claude-duvalier-rights-violations-2011-">investigate crimes committed against humanity</a> [press release] allegedly committed under the rule of Duvalier during the 1970s and 80s. This came shortly after Duvalier was detained and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-files-theft-and-corruption-charges-against-former-president-duvalier.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with corruption, embezzlement and a number of other crimes. Four people, including former UN spokesperson Michele Montas, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-ex-presdient-accused-of-crimes-against-humanity.php">filed criminal complaints</a> [JURIST Report] as well.

Medvedev was <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110705/165041538.html">receptive</a> [RIA Novosti report] to the granting amnesties with the Council in the South Caucasus city of Nalchik, but the issue of amnesty is the authority of the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian]. The Council head said the amnesties would not exclude certain criminals convicted under the crimes, thus freeing Khodorkovsky, who was once CEO of <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">Yukos Oil</a> [JURIST news archive] and one of the richest men in Russia. He has served half of a 13-year sentence for fraud, theft and money laundering along with his business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Platon+Lebedev">news archive</a>], who is serving time for similar charges. At the meeting Medvedev <a href="http://eng.state.kremlin.ru/face/2516">told the council</a> [statement, text]:<blockquote>Amnesties, of course, are something that come under the State Duma's powers, although ultimately, the decision to grant an amnesty is a reflection of the authorities' policy overall. We should look at which categories an amnesty would apply to. But there is absolutely no ignoring that our criminal law, after decades of inertia, is finally changing and advancing. My hope is simply that you will all do more to help me in this work, help me with your advice and the positions you take.</blockquote>But many say the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-07/kremlin-council-urges-amnesty-for-economic-crimes-khodorkovsky.html">amnesty is unlikely</a> [Bloomberg report] since it would boost Medvedev at the expense of former president and current <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] who will likely run against Medvedev in the 2012 election. During the meeting, the Council also said that the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in pre-trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-president-medvedev-admits-jailed-lawyer-was-beaten-to-death.php">was the result of criminal acts</a> [JURIST report], differing from the previous explanation that had blamed prison doctors. 

<p>Medvedev has been trying to play the role of reformer to separate himself from Putin heading into the 2012 elections. A former lawyer, he has pushed for legal reform expressing the need for Russia to improve its legal system to make a better commitment to the rule of law. In December 2008, Medvedev's first year in office, he <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">proposed Russian courts become more transparent</a> [JURIST report] in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. Speaking at the seventh All-Russian Congress of Judges, Medvedev said that the ECHR cannot and should not replace Russian courts. Russia is the source of more applications to the ECHR than any other country. Medvedev proposed measures to improve the quality of judges and provide broader access to court documents. He encouraged the congress to discuss his concerns and make concrete proposals. In June 2008, Medvedev said he was committed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-president-pledges-support-for.php">improving Russia's human rights record</a> and enforcing the rule of law, reiterating pledges he made at his <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/incoming-russia-president-stresses.php">May inauguration</a> [JURIST reports]. Medvedev has also promised top legal officials he would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/russia-president-vows-reforms-to-rid.php">tackle corruption and intimidation in the Russian judicial system</a> [JURIST report], calling for reforms to better train and support judges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As part of the nonprosecution agreement, JPMorgan admits to and takes responsibility for its former employees engaging in anticompetitive practices to rig bidding for municipal securities that involved the investment of proceeds from municipal bonds. JPMorgan <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-143.htm">agreed to pay</a> [press release] $51.2 million to the affected municipalities, and its affiliates agreed to pay $177 million to settle parallel charges from other federal and state authorities including 25 states' attorneys general, the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC), the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS), the <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</a> (OCC) and the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve Board</a> (Fed) [official websites]. The SEC enforcement <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2011/comp-pr2011-143.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleged that JPMorgan used, "fraudulent practices, misrepresentations, and omissions affected the prices of the reinvestment instruments, deprived the municipalities of a conclusive presumption that their reinvestment instruments were purchased at fair market value, and/or jeopardized the tax-exempt status of the underlying securities, thereby injuring numerous Municipalities."

<p>The investigation into the municipal bond investment market also led to a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/May/11-at-567.html">$160 million settlement</a> [press release] with <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS AG</a> in May and a similar settlement with <a href="http://www.bankofamerica.com/index.cfm?page=about">Bank of America</a> [corporate websites] last December. Last month, JPMorgan reached a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">$153.6 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] for fraud charges brought by the SEC for allegedly misleading investors during the housing crisis. JPMorgan agreed to pay a $133 million fine, in addition to $20.6 million for fraudulent profits and interest.

The ban, though not dissolved, had been relaxed in recent years. In 2007, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/fcc-overturns-media-consolidation.php">changed the rule</a> [JURIST report] to allow companies to own newspapers and television stations in the 20 largest media markets provided there were at least eight media outlets in the market to compete. The court found that the FCC did not fulfill the "notice and comment requirements" of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sup_01_5_10_I_30_5.html">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) [5 USC &#167; 551 text], by allowing comments for only 28 days instead of the traditional 90, and giving notice in a <em>New York Times</em> op-ed. It also criticized the vagueness of the published Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPR):<blockquote>While the new rule varies limits depending on characteristics of markets&#8212;specifically, market size and the number of media voices&#8212;it was not clear from the FNPR which characteristics the Commission was considering or why. The phrase&#8212;"characteristics of markets" was too open-ended to allow for meaningful comment on the Commission's approach. In addition, many central elements of the rule are not based on "characteristics of markets" at all. For example, key aspects of the rule rely on: the amount of "local news" produced by an individual station involved in a potential merger and how that term is defined; the definition of "major media voices," including what counts as a major newspaper; how "market concentration" is measured; whether a station is "failing"; whether a station exercises "independent news judgment" and how that term is defined; and whether a case-by-case approach or a categorical approach to proposed mergers would better serve the public interest. The FNPR also did not solicit comment on the overall framework under consideration, how potential factors might operate together, or how the new approach might affect the FCC's other ownership rules. These were significant omissions.</blockquote>One of the parties to the case, the <a href = "http://www.mediaaccess.org/">Media Access Project</a> [advocacy website] said they were <a href = "http://www.mediaaccess.org/2011/07/appeals-court-broadcast-ownership-decision-is-a-vindication-of-the-publics-right-to-have-a-diverse-media-environment/">pleased with the decision</a> [press release]: "This decision is a vindication of the public's right to have a diverse media environment."

<p>In 2004, the Third Circuit <a href="/pdf/prometheusvfcc.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] a previous FCC effort to relax the media ownership rules. The appeals court found the commission did not sufficiently justify or use reasoned analysis to arrive at some of the proposed rule changes. The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/supreme-court-turns-back-appeal-of.php">let the decision stand without comment</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

When Leal Garcia was arrested for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl, he was denied consular access, as required by <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [text, PDF]. There was then a hearing in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/docs/Avena-Judgment-full-text.pdf">held</a> [judgment, PDF] that Leal Garcia and other Mexican nationals were entitled to hearings in Texas on the consular rights violation in their cases. As neither Texas nor the federal government has codified the treaty, Leal Garcia never received this appeals hearing. The US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] argued Leal Garcia's execution would <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/doj-files-brief-in-supreme-court-to-stay-execution-of-mexico-national.php">cause irreparable harm</a> [JURIST report] to relations with Mexico and violate the US's obligations under international law, and asked that the execution be stayed until the <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/BillText-ConsularNotificationComplianceAct.pdf">Consular Notification Compliance Act</a> [text, PDF] passes, thus giving Leal Garcia an avenue to appeal his conviction as a violation of his consular rights. In a split <em>per curiam</em> opinion, the majority rejected the Obama administration's arguments that Leal Garcia's execution would be detrimental to foreign policy to the degree that they needed to introduce a stay, and cited their previous ruling in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/medvtex">Medellin v. Texas</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/supreme-court-rules-in-federally.php">report</a>], not to stay an execution in a similar situation:<blockquote>First, we are doubtful that it is ever appropriate to stay a lower court judgment in light of unenacted legislation. Our task is to rule on what the law is, not what it might eventually be. In light of <span class="casename">Medellin I</span>, it is clear that there is no "fair prospect that a majority of the Court will conclude that the decision below was erroneous," and our task should be at an end. Neither the United States nor Justice Breyer cites a single instance in this Court's history in which a stay issued under analogous circumstances. Even if there were circumstances under which a stay could issue in light of proposed legislation, this case would not present them. ... It has now been seven years since the ICJ ruling and three years since our decision in <span class="casename">Medellin I</span>, making a stay based on the bare introduction of a bill in a single house of Congress even less justified. If a statute implementing <span class="casename">Avena</span> had genuinely been a priority for the political branches, it would have been enacted by now.</blockquote>Leal Garcia's defense team also made a <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] argument, which the court rejected. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing the dissent, argued that Leal Garcia was entitled to the "procedure" of a consular rights hearing, and the Court should not question the administration's understanding of foreign policy needs:<blockquote>Thus, on the one hand, international legal obligations, related foreign policy considerations, the prospect of legislation, and the consequent injustice involved should that legislation, coming too late for Leal, help others in identical circumstances all favor granting a stay. And issuing a brief stay until the end of September, when the Court could consider this matter in the ordinary course, would put Congress on clear notice that it must act quickly. On the other hand, the State has an interest in proceeding with an immediate execution. But it is difficult to see how the State's interest in the immediate execution of an individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago can outweigh the considerations that support additional delay, perhaps only until the end of the summer. Consequently I would grant the stay that the petitioner requests. In reaching its contrary conclusion, the Court ignores the appeal of the President in a matter related to foreign affairs, it substitutes its own views about the likelihood of congressional action for the views of Executive Branch officials who have consulted with Members of Congress, and it denies the request by four Members of the Court to delay the execution until the Court can discuss the matter at Conference in September. In my view, the Court is wrong in each respect.</blockquote>Leal Garcia was <a href = "http://www.ktsm.com/news/texas-executes-mexican-after-court-stay-rejected">executed</a> [KTSM report] Thursday evening, an hour after the decision. The decision has drawn criticism from several sources, including a number of US diplomats and US Senator <a href = "http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website], the author of the Consular Notification Compliance Act, who said, "Americans detained overseas rely on their access to US consulates every day. If we expect other countries to abide by the treaties they join, the United States must also honor its obligations."

<p>A stay to Leal Garcia's execution garnered international support. Officials from the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-urges-texas-to-halt-execution.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] directly to Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] alleging Leal Garcia did not receive a fair trial. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] wrote a personal letter to Perry asking for Leal Garcia's sentence to be commuted. Letters of support for Leal Garcia arrived from several nations, including Mexico, Chile, El Salvador, Honduras, Switzerland, Uruguay, as well as the EU. Former president George W. Bush denounced the sentence when he was in office, issuing an <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/docs/Bush-memorandum.pdf">executive memoranda</a> [text, PDF] that Texas had to comply with the ICJ's ruling in approximately 50 Mexican nationals' planned executions. The Supreme Court ruled in <span class="casename">Medellin v. Texas</span> that Bush did not have the authority to direct a state court to comply with a ruling from the ICJ. However, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Congress could make the treaty binding in domestic law. Texas has already executed <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-second-foreign-national.php">two Mexican nationals</a> [JURIST report] who were denied consular access.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontushouse.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted Thursday for a measure to restrict funding for US military operations in Libya but voted down a measure to entirely defund it. In another contradictory message from the House on approval for operations in Libya, it narrowly defeated a bipartisan <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.02219:">measure</a> [materials] <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll514.xml">199-229</a> [roll call vote] sponsored by <a href="http://kucinich.house.gov">Dennis Kucinich</a> (D-OH) and <a href="http://amash.house.gov/">Justin Amash</a> (R-MI) to defund all operations in Libya but passed a separate <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.02219:">measure</a> [materials] <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll513.xml">225-201</a> [roll call vote] sponsored by <a href="http://cole.house.gov/">Tom Cole</a> (R-OK) [official websites] to deny funding for equipment and training related to the operations in Libya. Last month, the House <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/house-votes-down-authorization-for-libya-but-continues-to-fund-it.php">overwhelmingly defeated a measure</a> [JURIST report] to authorize the operations in Libya while also defeating a measure to defund it. US forces have been in Libya beyond the time limit imposed by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_33.html">1973 War Powers Resolution</a> [50 USC &#167; 1541 <em>et seq.</em>], which requires congressional authorization for further use of force. However, even if the measure to defund was passed, it had little chance of passing the <a href="http://senate.gov">Senate</a> [official website] which has a Democratic majority. The Senate was set to pass a resolution authorizing operations in Libya, but Senate Majority Leader <a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Harry Reid</a> (NV) [official website] <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/house-narrowly-rejects-measure-to-defund-libyan-mission/2011/07/07/gIQALcvN2H_blog.html">postponed it</a> [WP report] for procedural reasons. 

<p>The recent House votes show limited support for US military operations in Libya after the expiration of presidential authority under the War Powers Act. However, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-releases-report-justifying-actions-and-cost-in-libya.php">released a report arguing he is not violating the War Powers Act</a> [JURIST report] since the US is merely providing support as is required by several international treaties and does not have enough participation in the conflict to declare war. However, it was reported that Obama came to this conclusion on the advice of White House counsel, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-lawyers-divided-over-legality-of-us-operations-in-libya.php">overriding the official interpretations</a> [JURIST report] of both the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel</a> [official websites]. Last month, Speaker of the House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] had threatened to defund the mission after sending Obama a letter earlier in the month warning him that he was within five days of violating the War Powers Act. Also last month, Kucinich and <a href="http://jones.house.gov">Walter Jones</a> (R-NC) [official websites] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/lawmakers-file-suit-against-obama-for-continuing-actions-in-libya.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking to enjoin further action in Libya. Obama's report endorsed a <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:194:./list/bss/d112SE.lst::">pending resolution</a> [bill materials] that would provide some congressional support for continued efforts in Libya, though not approval of declaring war. The report also detailed that the US has spent USD $716 million and will spend $1.1 billion by the end of September.</p>

Mounir Ali pleaded guilty in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] to being involved in the hijacking of a US yacht called Quest, in which four Americans were taken hostage and later killed by the pirates. They were the first US citizens to die in the recent wave of international <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pirates">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive]. Ali admitted that he willingly joined four other men in a pirated Somali ship as they attempted to hijack the US vessel. He noted in his plea agreement that he personally did not shoot any of the hostages nor did he order them be shot. Neil MacBride, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/vae/">US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website], said Ali, "admitted today that his greed for ransom money ultimately led to the cold-blooded murder of the four U.S. hostages. This latest guilty plea again shows that modern piracy is far different than the romantic portrayal in summer-time movies. Pirates who attack on U.S. citizens on the high seas will face justice in a U.S. courtroom." In March, a grand jury in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia indicted 14 suspects, 13 Somali and one Yemeni, for hijacking the Quest. They were charged with piracy, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and the use of firearms during a crime. Ali awaits sentencing scheduled for October.

<p>Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. In April, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">Somali pirate was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to 25 years in prison for attacking a Danish ship off the coast of Somalia in 2008, for which he and other pirates received a $1.7 million ransom. The few countries that have attempted to prosecute them include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Commission, while criticizing the coup, did note that there is no formal judicial process in the <a href = "http://www.honduras.net/honduras_constitution2.html">Constitution of Honduras</a> [text, in Spanish] to remove a corrupt elected official, as Zelaya allegedly was.<blockquote>This way [a coup] of processing the political crisis, using a procedure outside the law, using force to oust the president abroad and using the military to resolve a political conflict, first, showed the low capacity of the political class to reach an agreement and, second, the inability of democratic institutions to resolve the crisis using the mechanisms and provisions of the laws of Honduras.</blockquote>The Commission had several <a href = "http://www.elheraldo.hn/Pa%C3%ADs/listado-nota/Ediciones/2011/07/07/Noticias/Recomendaciones-de-la-Comision-de-la-Verdad">recommendations</a> [<em>Heraldo</em> report, in Spanish] for Honduras, including: revise the Constitution to grant more rights and limit Executive power, clarify the role of the Armed Forces in a crisis, create a new structure for choosing the judiciary, and investigate and prosecute all human rights violations that occurred during Zelaya's removal. The <a href = "http://www.oas.org/en/default.asp">Organization of American States</a> (OAS) [official website] <a href = "http://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-755/11">praised the report</a> [press release], saying they "hoped Honduran society would retake the active road towards facing the serious problems of its population: poverty, crime, and the need for economic and social development."

<p>Zelaya signed an <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/honduras-ex-president-zelaya-signs-agreement-allowing-return-to-country.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] in May allowing his return to the country after nearly two years in exile. Earlier that month, a Honduran court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/honduras-court-dismisses-conspiracy-charges-against-ex-president-zelaya.php">dismissed the two remaining conspiracy charges</a> [JURIST report] against Zelaya, clearing the way for his return to the country. In March, the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/2011-3-22-%20Complaint%20-%20FINAL.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-brings-foia-suit-against-us-agencies-over-honduras-coup.php">compel the release of documents related to the coup</a> [JURIST report]. The complaint names the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> and <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> [official websites] as defendants, alleging the agencies withheld documents regarding if and how the US government and its interests affected the coup. In November, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/structure+of+the+court/office+of+the+prosecutor/biographies/the+prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icc-begins-preliminary-investigations-in-honduras-and-nigeria.php">opened a preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the coup. Last July, a Honduran court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/honduras-judge-drops-abuse-of-power-charges-against-ousted-leader-zelaya.php">dismissed abuse of power charges</a> against Zelaya because his successor <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-president-pardons-military.php">granted amnesty</a> [JURIST reports] to Zelaya and those involved in his removal. In June 2010, <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-honduras-to-investigate-violations-stemming-from-2009-coup.php">accused the Honduran government</a> [JURIST report] of failing to address human rights violations stemming from the coup.

The lawsuit was filed in the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] to block the budget that North Carolina lawmakers passed by overriding <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website]. PPCNC said that over the last fiscal year, it provided health family planning and reproductive health exams for nearly 7,000 women, as well as approximately 8,289 tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The North Carolina budget does <a href="http://www.wral.com/news/state/nccapitol/story/9830150/">not block Medicaid funds</a> [WRAL report] to Planned Parenthood as the Indiana budget that was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-issues-injunction-against-indiana-abortion-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge last month, but prevents PPCNC from even applying for grants. Janet Colm, president of PPCNC, released a statement denouncing the budget: <blockquote>This budget may target Planned Parenthood, but the men, women and teens of North Carolina are the ultimate victims of this discriminatory legislation. This is the first time in North Carolina's history that a single health care provider has been carved out in the budget and banned from applying for competitive grants from the state. ... Not only is this bill bad policy, but it's also bad politics. We hope the court will work to protect the people we serve, and will ensure that Planned Parenthood can continue to receive state and federal funding to assist us in providing critical health services to North Carolina women, men, and teens.</blockquote>PPCNC said that over the last fiscal year, it provided health family planning and reproductive health exams for nearly 7,000 women, as well as, providing approximately 8,289 tests for sexually transmitted diseases. 

<p>Last month, Perdue also <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina bill that would have required women seeking an abortion to wait 24 hours and to view an ultrasound of the fetus before an <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive]. Perdue called it "a dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors." Indiana is <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/indiana-to-appeal-ruling-on-planned-parenthood-funding.php">appealing</a> [JURIST report] the preliminary injunction to its denial of funding for <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana</a> (PPIN) [advocacy website]. The Obama administration has taken a stance against the Indiana law an the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a brief <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-indiana-ban-on-medicaid-funds-to-abortion-providers-violates-federal-law.php">urging the court to grant an injunction</a> [JURIST report] to stop the enforcement of the law. The ban includes disbursement of grant money, including federal Medicare funds, a provision PPIN claims is not legal under the federal Medicaid Act's "freedom of choice" provision, which allows states to disallow Medicare funding for medical providers based on deficiencies in quality of service. In May, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that would have restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaclu.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] announced Friday that it is filing a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/1-0_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging a controversial Alabama <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">law</a> [HB 56 text; <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/ViewBillsStatusACASLogin.asp?BillNumber=hb56">materials</a>] that expands restrictions on undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit, filed in the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website], seeks injunctive relief to stop the law's enforcement and a declaration that the entire law is unconstitutional. The law contains measures comparable to those <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">passed in Arizona</a> [JURIST report] last year including authorizing police officers to detain an individual on "reasonable suspicion" the individual is in the country illegally, and requirements that businesses use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. The ACLU argues that HB 56 is preempted by federal law and that, among other constitutional violations, it violates the Fourth Amendment by subjecting citizens and non-citizens with permission to be in the US to unreasonable searches and seizures. The complaint says, "HB 56 is reminiscent of the worst aspects of Alabama's history in its pervasive and systematic targeting of a class of persons through punitive state laws that seek to render every aspect of daily life more difficult and less equal." The law indicates that unlawful immigration increases education costs, crime, and economic hardship, and that the bill protects the public interest of Alabama citizens.

<p>Alabama <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed the HB 56 into law</a> last month a week after it the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">legislature passed it</a> [JURIST report]. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. In May, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-coalition-seeks-to-block-additional-provisions-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] an Arizona employment law that imposes penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text].

The Senegalese government had <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/arrested-chad-ex-leader-in-legal-limbo.php">refused to extradite</a> [JURIST report] Habre, despite ongoing international pressure to prosecute him for crimes against humanity. The Senegalese Minister of Communication and Spokesperson of the Government, Moustapha Guirassy, in confirming the announcement, stated their decision was based on a desire to be in compliance with the <a href = "http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> [official website]. Habre will be returned on July 11, although Senegal has <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jH-pff-zV5PgimXNAvN5-eooE9EQ?docId=CNG.b25e50471bf7cd80f49ff0b9169e31d7.a41">not confirmed that he is in custody</a> [AFP report].

<p>Last year, an <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/senegal-security-forces-violating-human-rights-with-impunity-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] cited the case of Habre as a prime example of Senegal's "contempt" for the rule of law. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.african-court.org/">African Court on Human and People's Rights</a> (AfCHPR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/africa-rights-court-refuses-to-take.php">found that it lacked jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to hear a case against Senegal on whether charges against Habre should be dropped. Habre has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. He later fled to Senegal after being removed from power in 1990. Belgium has sought to try him under the principle of universal jurisdiction, but Senegal has long refused extradition. Earlier that year, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/icj-denies-belgium-request-to-force.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Belgium's request to compel Habre's extradition. Belgium had accused Senegal of violating international law, including Article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, by not trying Habre in Senegal, where he has lived under house arrest since 1990. The ICJ found that assurances made by Senegal that Habre would remain in custody until trial were sufficient and that "the risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights claimed by Belgium is not apparent."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] dismissed the lawsuit in 2009. Plaintiffs alleged that ExxonMobil hired members of the Indonesian military as security that it knew had committed human rights abuses in the past. They claim that the security forces committed abuses including genocide, extrajudicial killing, torture, crimes against humanity, sexual violence and kidnapping in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Torture Statute</a> (ATS) [28 USC &#167; 1350] and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victims Protection Act of 1991</a> [text]. The plaintiffs appealed that decision and ExxonMobil issued a cross-appeal arguing for the first time that it was immune from the lawsuit since it is not subject to the ATS. The court held that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient facts to prove ExxonMobil was guilty of aiding and abetting and that "neither the text, history, nor purpose of the ATS supports corporate immunity for torts based on heinous conduct allegedly committed by its agents in violation of the law of nations." One judge dissented arguing that the ATS is meant to apply to conduct within the US or on the high seas, not in foreign countries, and that the ATS does not apply to corporations since it depends on customary international law that does not recognize corporate liability. 

<p>The federal courts have recently allowed lawsuits alleging violations of the ATS and TVPA for violence overseas by paramilitary troops hired by US corporations. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-permits-suits-against-chiquita-over-colombia-violence-to-continue.php">permitted lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] under the ATS and TVPA against <a href="http://www.chiquitabrands.com/">Chiquita Brand International</a> [corporate website] to move forward. Family members of several thousand victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia filed suit against Chiquita Brand International, which has admitted to funding <a href="http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/auc.cfm">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CDI backgrounder], a right-wing paramilitary group in Colombia. In May, the <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] allowed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-allows-argentine-suit-against-daimler-ag-for-involvement-in-dirty-war.php">lawsuit by Argentine citizens</a> against <a href = "http://www.daimler.com/dccom">Daimler AG</a> [official website] for the actions of <a href = "http://www.mercedes-benz.com.ar/content/argentina/mpc/mpc_argentina_website/es/home_mpc/passengercars.html">Mercedes-Benz Argentina</a> [official website, in Spanish] during the nation's 1976-1983 <A href = "http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>]. The suit, which was dismissed by the <a href = "http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for  the Northern District of California</a> [official website] in 2005 due to a lack of jurisdiction, alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina "collaborated with state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill the plaintiffs and/or their relatives."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Chairman of the UN Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries, Jose Luis Gomez del Prado, said in a press conference that there is currently a gap in the jurisdictional rights of countries when non-governmental forces exceed their authority in another nation.

<p>Gomez specifically pointed to the use of contractors by the US in Iraq, and cited that as a reason for the urgent regulation of these agencies: "While US troops are scheduled to leave Iraq by the end of the year, security contractors are there to stay."</p>

<p>A former contractor for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater</a> [JURIST news archive], now known as <a href="http://www.xeservices.com/">Xe Services</a> [corporate website], was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Convicted-ex-blackwater-contractor-sentenced-to-2.5-years-for-manslaughter.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] last month to two-and-a-half years in prison for the 2009 shooting of an unarmed Afghan civilian in Kabul. Earlier that month, four former Blackwater contractors <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/blackwater-guards-challenge-reinstatement-of-manslaughter-case.php">appealed</a> the April decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-case-against-blackwater-guards.php">reinstate</a> manslaughter charges against them in connection with their alleged roles in a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">2007 shooting incident</a> [JURIST reports] in Baghdad, Iraq. In April 2010, a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-blackwater-executives-indicted.php">indicted five former Blackwater executives</a> [JURIST report] on charges of weapons violations and lying to investigators. In February 2010, the Iraqi government ordered 250 former Blackwater employees to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">leave Iraq</a> [JURIST report] in reaction to the dismissal of charges against former Blackwater employees <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">accused in the deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] in 2007. That month, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/blackwater-under-investigation-for.php">opened an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether Blackwater bribed the Iraqi government to be permitted to continue operating in Iraq following the 2007 shootings. Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">ceased operations in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 when its security contracts expired and were not renewed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay said that the US <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11214&LangID=E">denied consular access</a> [press release] to Leal Garcia, which was his right under <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [text, PDF]. Although the State of Texas convicted and sentenced Leal Garcia for murder in 1998, Pillay noted the broad reach of the state's actions:<blockquote>Today's execution will undermine the role of the International Court of Justice, and its ramifications are likely to spread far beyond Texas. It is also the responsibility of all federal countries ensure that all individual states respect the international obligations assumed by the country as a whole.</blockquote>Officials from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] earlier this month appealed unsuccessfully to Texas <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website; <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-urges-texas-to-halt-execution.php">JURIST report</a>] and the <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/bpp/">Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles</a> [official website] to stay the execution. The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution-of-mexican-national.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution Thursday, with the majority in a split <em>per curiam</em> opinion rejecting the Obama administration's arguments that Leal Garcia's execution would be detrimental to foreign policy to the degree that they needed to introduce a stay. Texas officials <a href="http://www.ktsm.com/news/texas-executes-mexican-after-court-stay-rejected">executed</a> [KTSM report] Leal Garcia an hour after the decision. 

<p>The execution has drawn criticism from several sources. The <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/Comunicados/English/2011/67-11eng.htm">criticized the US for the execution</a> [press release] on Friday, saying that Leal Garcia did not receive a fair trial. A number of US officials have also criticized the execution, including diplomats and US Senator <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website], the author of the Consular Notification Compliance Act, who said, "Americans detained overseas rely on their access to US consulates every day. If we expect other countries to abide by the treaties they join, the United States must also honor its obligations." Mexico, Chile, El Salvador, Honduras, Switzerland, Uruguay and the EU had sent letters to the US requesting a stay of the execution. Former president George W. Bush denounced the sentence when he was in office, issuing an <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/docs/Bush-memorandum.pdf">executive memoranda</a> [text, PDF] that Texas had to comply with the ICJ's ruling in approximately 50 Mexican nationals' planned executions. Texas has already <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-second-foreign-national.php">executed two Mexican nationals</a> [JURIST report] who were denied consular access.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If convicted, the men <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2011/three-somalis-charged-with-death-eligible-counts-in-murder-of-four-u.s.-citizens">could face death sentences</a> [FBI press release] for a majority of the counts, which include kidnapping, hostage-taking and murder. US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Neil MacBride noted the serious nature of the charges: <blockquote>The superseding indictment accuses these three men of summarily executing the hostages&#8212;without provocation&#8212;while the military was attempting to negotiate their release. With the additional charges, the defendants now potentially face a death sentence if convicted of these horrendous crimes, and the superseding indictment constitutes another important step in bringing to justice those accused of being directly responsible for the killing of innocent Americans. Today's charges underscore that we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to attacks on our citizens.</blockquote> The men are accused of hijacking a US yacht called Quest in February, in which four Americans were taken hostage and later killed by the pirates. They were the first US citizens to die in the recent wave of international <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pirates">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive]. The FBI and the <a href="http://www.ncis.navy.mil/Pages/publicdefault.aspx">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a> [official website] are investigating the case and the court has scheduled an arraignment for July 20. In March, a grand jury in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia indicted 14 suspects, 13 Somali and one Yemeni, for hijacking the Quest. The Yemeni suspect <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/yemeni-pirate-pleads-guilty-to-hijacking-vessel-that-killed-4-us-citizens.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] Thursday and awaits sentencing scheduled for October. Several other suspects <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/two-more-somali-pirates-plead-guilty-in-us-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May.

<p>Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. In April, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">Somali pirate was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to 25 years in prison for attacking a Danish ship off the coast of Somalia in 2008, for which he and other pirates received a $1.7 million ransom. The few countries that have attempted to prosecute them include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/politica/2011/07/09/visualizza_new.html_787922607.html">ruling</a> [ANSA report, in Italian] represents a reduction from the 750 million euro award originally imposed by the <a href="http://www.tribunale.milano.it/">Court of Milan</a> [official website, in Italian] in October 2009. The complaint stems from Fininvest's 1991 acquisition of Italian publishing company <a href="http://www.mondadori.com/">Mondadori</a> [corporate website], during which Fininvest bribed a judge in exchange for favorable decisions. The judge and a Fininvest lawyer were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gsLAn4a58G2R5MoQZrIyuQzM2Kow?docId=CNG.1919b38c39ffd7eaad2577b64ff09bb8.11">convicted</a> [AFP report] of criminal corruption charges in 2007. Fininvest announced its intention to appeal the ruling, though the fine is due immediately regardless of appellate status.  

<p>Berlusconi has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases, including ongoing cases involving <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-appears-in-court-calls-tax-fraud-hearing-a-waste-of-time.php">tax fraud</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">fraud and embezzlement</a> [JURIST reports].

In the capital city of Juba, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12107760">President Salva Kiir</a> [BBC profile] was <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/07/10/bloomberg1376-LO2QK40D9L3501-6209VG7IOLIUESPE4KHMDO2DG3.DTL">sworn in</a> [Bloomberg report] for a four-year term, in which he hopes to lead the world's newest nation into a time marked by less corruption and violence. After taking his oath, Kiir offered amnesty to rebel groups that continue to create conflict within the country. Voters living in southern Sudan overwhelmingly showed their support for the Southern Sudan's Independence Referendum in January 2011, when it passed with 98.83 percent of the vote. In February, Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>], who campaigned against secession, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sudan-president-accepts-southern-sudans-vote-for-independance.php">issued a formal decree</a> [JURIST report] accepting the result of the referendum.

<p>Tensions between the newly independent country and Sudan have been especially high as of late. Much of the recent violence stems from action in the South Kordofan region of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/820864.stm">Sudan</a> [BBC backgrounder] between Sudanese troops and troops loyal to South Sudan's army. Last month, A UN official <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-criticizes-sudan-for-human-rights-abuses.php">denounced continued human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against civilians in the region. The UN Under-Secretary-General for <a href="http://www.un.org/en/humanitarian/">Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] and Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=145">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] said that the UN knows of more than 70,000 people who have been displaced by the conflict, many of whom are subject to violence and targeting due to their ethnic heritage. Additionally, the UN reported that several <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38798&Cr=Kordofan&Cr1=">peacekeepers had been held and tortured</a> [UN News Centre report] in the region, and that those providing humanitarian relief are vulnerable.South Kordofan is a state in the center of Sudan, and has been a disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan, due to its oil reserves. Despite months of negotiations, a final deal regarding how the two countries will share oil revenue has not been reached.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The filings seek to dissolve the Puea Thai party on grounds that the party's campaign involved former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and other banned politicians. A spokesperson for the Democrat Party <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/07/09/Challenge-filed-to-Thailand-election/UPI-76751310241338/">denied being involved</a> [UPI report] with the legal challenge. Wirat Kallayasiri, a part of the Democrat legal team, stated that the Constitution prohibits executives from any disbanded party to be involved with any other party during the suspension period.

They were arrested on terrorism charges stemming from their involvement in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thailand+protests">anti-government protests</a> [JURIST news archive] in Bangkok.

Pillay advised Senegal to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jXpnrXdfAShoHBS3RhjJzJMpa6QA?docId=CNG.a51e0ccb6c8ecb11fbc3a0a97df80911.a01">review its decision</a> [AFP report] to return Habre, citing a possible violation of international law due to the absence of guarantees that he would be free from torture and receive a fair trial. Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-to-deport-former-chad-president-habre.php">announced its decision</a> [JURIST report] to deport Habre on Friday, with his return scheduled to take place Monday. After refusing to extradite him for years, Senegalese leaders stated their recent decision is based on a desire to be in compliance with the <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website]. A commission for the AU met last month to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/06/28/african-union-press-senegal-extradite-habr">discuss a report</a> [HRW report] in which Senegal's progress in organizing a trial was described as "marginal." A court in Chad <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/chad-court-sentences-ex-dictator-habre.php">sentenced Habre to death</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 during a trial from which he was absent.

<p>Last year, an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/senegal-security-forces-violating-human-rights-with-impunity-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] cited the case of Habre as a prime example of Senegal's "contempt" for the rule of law. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.african-court.org/">African Court on Human and People's Rights</a> (AfCHPR) [official website] found that it <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/africa-rights-court-refuses-to-take.php">lacked jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to hear a case against Senegal on whether charges against Habre should be dropped. Habre has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. He later fled to Senegal after being removed from power in 1990. Belgium has sought to try him under the principle of universal jurisdiction, but Senegal has long refused extradition. Earlier in 2009, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/icj-denies-belgium-request-to-force.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Belgium's request to compel Habre's extradition. Belgium had accused Senegal of violating international law, including Article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, by not trying Habre in Senegal, where he has lived under house arrest since 1990. The ICJ found that assurances made by Senegal that Habre would remain in custody until trial were sufficient and that "the risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights claimed by Belgium is not apparent." <br />

The court ruled that the appeals were inadmissible because the complaints failed to meet the requirements of Article 35 Section 3 and 4 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. Specifically, the court found that since the appeals were only meant to challenge a constitutional provision in a general manner in Switzerland, the applicants had failed to show any specific injury. Supporters and opponents were <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/Strasbourg_minaret_ruling_causes_no_surprise.html?cid=30645168">not surprised</a> [Swissinfo report] by the ECHR's decision.

<p>Ouardiri <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-minaret-ban-challenged-in.php">filed his complaint</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009, alleging that the ban violates his rights to freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination under Articles 9, 13, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2009, a group of <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/switzerland-liberals-call-for.php">Swiss intellectuals called for</a> [JURIST report] the ban's reversal. Swiss Supreme Court President Lawrence Meyer also <a href="http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/politik/schweiz/minarett-verbot_bereits_beim_bundesgericht_1.4116034.html">said</a> [NZZ report, in German], in December 2009 that two suits had been filed in federal court challenging the ban's legality.

Sanader had begun an appeal of his extradition arguing that it would be impossible to receive a fair trial in Croatia, but he <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-ex-pm-drops-extradition-appeal-faces-corruption-charges.php">dropped it after media speculation</a> [JURIST report] suggested the appeal process could harm Croatia's accession to the EU.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.european-council.europa.eu/home-page.aspx?lang=en">European Council</a> [official website] agreed to grant <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/croatia/index_en.htm">Croatia</a> [EC materials] EU membership following six years of accession negotiations. The decision calls for negotiations to close by the end of the month and the accession treaty to be signed by year's end, allowing for the country to become the 28th member of the EU on July 1, 2013. In the interim, EU leaders strongly encouraged Croatia to continue pursuing crucial reform initiatives. On the same day Sanader was arrested, former interior ministry official Tomislav Mercep was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/top-croatia-official-arrested-for-war-crimes.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of committing war crimes. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE201012081974&amp;lang=e">press release</a>] calling for the prosecution of individuals responsible for war crimes the day before Mercep's arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kwoyelo denies committing the crimes.

<p>The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] in May 2008, said it was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/icc-investigating-new-uganda-attacks-by.php">investigating possible new war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed by the LRA in recent attacks on Ugandan villages.

The four ICC-issued warrants were executed in 2005 and include LRA leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4320858.stm">Joseph Kony</a> and LRA senior member <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7083311.stm">Vincent Otti</a> [BBC profiles].

Kony, who remains in hiding, is wanted for orchestrating the killing of thousands of civilians and the enslavement of thousands more children over two decades of conflict. The government has said that <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/uganda-officials-say-rebel-leader.php">Kony is willing to face trial at home</a> [JURIST report], but not at the ICC.

Senegal <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZdYzAbPVET-CAHKVNwBvXralETw?docId=CNG.5daf9b1852bed4e2e24c039d0b187f02.661">suspended plans late Sunday</a> [AFP report] just hours before Habre was set to board a plane. The decision came after Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued a plea</a> [JURIST report] not to return Habre to Chad, which has already sentenced him to death <em>in absentia</em> and where she fears he will be tortured. Senegal had announced Friday it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-to-deport-former-chad-president-habre.php">deporting Habre to Chad</a> [JURIST report] to face charges for war crimes. However, Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11217&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] that Habre would not receive a fair trial in Chad and that extradition may violate international law:<blockquote>I urge the Government of Senegal to review its decision and to ensure that Habre's extradition is carried out in a way that ensures his fair trial rights will be respected and he will not be subjected to torture or the death penalty. As a party to the Convention Against Torture, Senegal may not extradite a person to a state where there are substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of being subjected to torture. At the very least Senegal must obtain fair trial guarantees from the Government of Chad before any extradition takes place. ... Extraditing Habre in the present circumstances, in which those guarantees are not yet in place, may amount to a violation of international law. ... Justice and accountability are of paramount importance and must be attained through a fair process in accordance with human rights law.</blockquote>Habre is also wanted in Belgium under a universal jurisdiction law that allows Belgian courts to here cases over violations of international law, but Senegal has long refused extradition. Habre has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. He later fled to Senegal after being removed from power in 1990. 

<p>Senegal government spokesman, Moustapha Guirassy, said Friday that the decision to deport Habre was based on a desire to be in compliance with the <a href = "http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> [official website]. Senegal has been under pressure to send Habre to a country where he will face trial for his alleged war crimes committed during his rule of Chad. Last year, an <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/senegal-security-forces-violating-human-rights-with-impunity-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] cited the case of Habre as a prime example of Senegal's "contempt" for the rule of law. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.african-court.org/">African Court on Human and People's Rights</a> (AfCHPR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/africa-rights-court-refuses-to-take.php">found that it lacked jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to hear a case against Senegal on whether charges against Habre should be dropped. Also in 2009, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/icj-denies-belgium-request-to-force.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Belgium's request to compel Habre's extradition. Belgium had accused Senegal of violating international law, including Article 7 of the Convention Against Torture, by not trying Habre in Senegal, where he has lived under house arrest since 1990. The ICJ found that assurances made by Senegal that Habre would remain in custody until trial were sufficient and that "the risk of irreparable prejudice to the rights claimed by Belgium is not apparent."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/german-appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-british-bishop-for-holocaust-denial/2011/07/11/gIQAVTdi8H_story.html">reduced his punishment</a> [AP report], however, to a fine of 6,500 euro from the initial 10,000 euro fine as a result of Williamson's financial circumstances. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/germany-court-convicts-uk-bishop-for.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] stemmed from an interview to Swedish TV channel SVT1, broadcast in January 2009, in which Williamson said he <a href="http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2010-04/williamson-holocaust-urteil">doubted</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Die Zeit</span> report, in German] that six million Jews were killed in gas chambers. The interview was rebroadcast over the Internet in Germany, where Holocaust denial is a crime. When Williamson gave the interview to the Swedish TV channel he asked the crew not to broadcast the interview in Germany. In 2009, the same court issued a 12,000 euro fine against Williamson in connection with this case, but Williamson contested the decision, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4879438,00.html">forcing the public trial</a> [DW report].  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/world/europe/25pope.html">lifting of Williamson's excommunication</a> [NYT report] following the conviction by <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/index.htm">Pope Benedict XVI</a> [Vatican profile] caused international outrage. 

<p>Several countries have passed similar laws that punish Holocaust denial. In February 2010, the <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/">Hungarian Parliament</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/hungary-parliament-passes-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that prohibits denials of the Holocaust. In November of the same year, the German <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-constitutional-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] legislation prohibiting public support and justification of the Nazi regime. After six years of contentious debate, the European Union <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/eu-approves-framework-decision.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a framework aimed at criminalizing denial of the Holocaust and other genocides in 2007. Also in 2007, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/german-court-sentences-zundel-to-5.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] anti-Semitic writer <a href="http://www.adl.org/learn/Ext_US/zundel.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=zundel">Ernst Zundel</a> [ADL profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zundel">news archive</a>] to five years in prison after finding him guilty on 14 counts of incitement, libel and disparaging the dead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Investigations into possible war crimes committed by the Gaddafi government are on-going. In June, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099321.pdf">Gaddafi</a>, his son <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a>, the "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister," and his brother-in-law <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099332.pdf">Abdullah al-Sanussi</a> [warrants, PDF], the head of intelligence. Moreno-Ocampo said his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">gathered "direct evidence"</a> [JURIST report] that shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protestors and that his forces used live ammunition on crowds, attacked civilians in their homes, used heavy weapons against people in funeral processions and placed snipers to shoot those leaving mosques after prayer services. Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] last month that his office was pursuing arrest warrants against Gaddafi and the two others in his "inner circle." At that time, Moreno-Ocampo said his office was almost prepared for trial, having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes and human rights violations over the Libyan revolt which has persisted since February. Earlier this month, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmalaysia.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] UN Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression Frank La Rue <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11225&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] Monday that Malaysia's response to protests on Saturday was too strong, restricting freedom of association and hindering democratic process. La Rue was responding to media reports that Malaysian authorities used tear gas and water cannons against protestors as part of a rally organized by <a href="http://bersih.org/">Bersih 2.0</a> [advocacy website], a coalition of non-government organizations pushing for democratic reforms in Malaysia. La Rue said that reports claimed that the Malaysian authorities' reaction resulted in injuries, at least one death and the arrest of more than 1,600 people in Kuala Lumpur, the nation's capital. La Rue said:<blockquote>The right to freedom of opinion and expression, including in the form of peaceful protests, is essential for democracy. By declaring the demonstration illegal, sealing off parts of the capital in advance and responding in such a heavy-handed manner against peaceful demonstrators, the Government of Malaysia risks undermining democratic progress in the country. ... Actions taken by the authorities prior to and during the rally unduly restricted the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and association. Declaring Bersih illegal based on claims that it is trying to topple the Government or is a risk to national security and public order&#8212;in the absence of any credible evidence to substantiate such claims&#8212;is also an unnecessary restriction of civil and political rights.</blockquote>Bersih 2.0 posted this video on its website which appears to be of Saturday's protests:
<p>
<center><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/odU5gJ7UHII" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Malaysian Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said there will be an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g0oqf2G517CsO3HBYO8G4u6Vp9og?docId=CNG.e5a20e02b0418da2580676458f4fa4e8.d1">investigation into allegations of police brutality</a> [AFP report] during the protests. He said the rally was on the verge of violence and that it did not have official permission.  </p>

<p>Last year, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] urged Malaysia to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-group-urges-malaysia-to-amend-internal-security-laws.php">repeal or amend its internal security laws</a> [JURIST report], which allow indefinite detainment without trial. At the end of an official visit, the group said amending the laws would allow Malaysia to conform to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. Malaysia's internal security laws have been heavily criticized. Last August, a Malaysian court <a href="/2009/08/malaysia-court-charges-protesters-for.php">charged 29 protesters</a> [JURIST report] for their alleged involvement in rallies against the country's Internal Security Act. The demonstration was allegedly started by the <a href="http://abolishisa.wordpress.com/">Abolish ISA Movement</a> [advocacy blog]. The law was protested by an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people in Kuala Lumpur, resulting in 589 arrests and the use of tear gas and water cannons by police. The protesters were charged with aiding an illegal organization or participating in an illegal rally since a police permit was not obtained. At the time, <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7973872.stm">profile</a>] dismissed the protest as being unnecessary since he previously pledged to review the controversial law. In 2008, Malaysian rights group <a href="http://www.suaram.net/index.php">Suaram</a> [advocacy website] said in a report that the human rights situation in Malaysia had deteriorated over the past year citing citing the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=malaysia+judicial">judicial fixing scandal</a> [JURIST news archive] and lax prosecution of human rights offenders by the <a href="http://www.suhakam.org.my/en/">Human Rights Commission of Malaysia</a> [official website]. It also criticized the continued use of the ISA, under which it said more than 70 prisoners, including some <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/malaysia-court-rules-ethnic-indian.php">human rights protesters</a> [JURIST report], were still being held without charge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] following the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us0711webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "Getting Away with Torture: The Bush Administration and Mistreatment of Detainees," HRW provided evidence suggesting that Bush and senior administration officials authorized torture and ill-treatment of detainees, rendition and the use of CIA secret detention programs, and alleged that such conduct was in violation of the laws of war, international law and US federal criminal law. HRW indicated that the criminal investigation should focus on Bush, as well as three other top officials including former vice president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3344815.stm">Dick Cheney</a> [BBC profile], defense secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Donald+Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive], and CIA director George Tenet. Though a number of key documents containing incriminating evidence against the Bush administration remain classified and those documents that have been disclosed are heavily redacted, HRW has compiled evidence supporting the allegation that the US committed crimes against detainees. HRW also indicated that Bush officials requested that politically appointed government lawyers create legal justifications to support the administration's conduct. HRW Executive Director Kenneth Roth said the current administration has failed to use adequate legal avenues for stopping the abusive conduct:<blockquote>President Obama has treated torture as an unfortunate policy choice rather than a crime. His decision to end abusive interrogation practices will remain easily reversible unless the legal prohibition against torture is clearly reestablished. The US has a legal obligation to investigate these crimes. If the US doesn't act on them, other countries should.</blockquote> HRW called for an independent, nonpartisan commission to investigate the abuses because investigations that have already been conducted were limited in scope, not independent and lacked thoroughness. 

<p>Several human rights groups have urged investigations into alleged detainee abuses authorized by the Bush administration. In February, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) and the <a href="http://www.ecchr.eu/">European Center for Human Rights</a> (ECCHR) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the signatory states of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text] to <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/human-rights-groups-announce-bush-indictment-convention-against-torture-sign">pursue criminal charges</a> [press release] against Bush. Other calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">rejected consistently by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] urged US Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Bush for violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00002340---A000-.html">federal statute prohibiting torture</a> [18 USC &#167; 2340A]. The ACLU argued that the use of waterboarding has historically been prosecuted as a crime in the US. Failure to investigate Bush would harm the US's ability to advocate for human rights in other countries, the ACLU said. Rumsfeld has also faced possible criminal charges in Europe, when, in 2007, a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/rumsfeld-war-crimes-complaint-filed-in.php">war crimes complaint was filed against him</a> [JURIST report] in Germany for his involvement in detainee treatment. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">case was later dismissed</a> [JURIST report]. In June 2010, the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-renews-call-accountability-start-torture-awareness-month">called</a> [press release] on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/aclu-renews-calls-for-bush-era-detainee-torture-investigation.php">stop shielding Bush administration officials</a> [JURIST report] from civil suit and criminal prosecution in relation to the treatment of detainees in US custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The High Court in the UK, before whom the case is still pending had asked the ECJ "a number of questions concerning the obligations to which a company operating an internet marketplace may be subject in order to prevent trade mark infringements by its users." The ECJ concluded that Member States have the jurisdiction to require website operators to enforce prevention of infringement. The court held once a product is targeted at consumers in the EU that EU trademark rules apply but that the operator is not liable if it merely allows users to post trademarked products on its website. However, the court further held that an operator could be liable for infringement if it takes an active role in assisting with or optimizing the presentation of trademarked products for sale.

<p>The L'Oreal case is not the first infringement claim against eBay. Last year, the Paris Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-appeals-court-upholds-judgment-against-ebay-but-reduces-damages.php"> upheld</a> [JURIST report] a 2008 judgment against eBay for its role in the sale of counterfeit goods but significantly reduced the amount of damages eBay had to pay. The appeals court <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=11553381">cut the damages</a> [AP report] to be paid to French luxury goods giant <a href="http://www.lvmh.com/">LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton</a> (LVMH) [corporate website] from 38 million euros (USD $49 million) to 5.7 million euros (USD $7.3 million). The <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/france-court-orders-ebay-to-pay-63.php">original judgment against eBay</a> [JURIST report] found that the website failed to prevent the sale of counterfeit luxury goods that infringed on registered designs. It <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100903005510/en/LVMH%C2%A0--Paris-Court-Appeal-Confirms-eBay's-Liability">established</a> [press release] that in France, eBay was liable for the sale of counterfeit goods or goods that were selected for special distribution. The court dismissed eBay's claim that it was just a mere host for selling services. Both sides claimed the appeals court ruling a victory. LVMH was pleased that the judgment was not overturned, while eBay claimed it as a win for the company and French consumers since the damages were so drastically reduced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court said that it appeared from the merit briefs in <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000492">Log Cabin Republicans v. USA</a> [case materials] that the government was not prepared to defend the constitutionality of DADT because it has only asserted that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [text and materials] is constitutional and has not addressed the specific constitutionality of DADT. The repeal act is set to repeal DADT, but currently the policy remains in effect. The court ordered the Obama administration either to defend the constitutionality of DADT or submit a letter to Congress from the Attorney General stating the administration's intention to refrain from defending it pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00000530---D000-.html">28 USC &#167; 530D(a)(1)(B)(ii)</a> [text]. The court said that if the Obama administration chooses not to defend DADT, it will allow one <em>amicus curiae</em> to participate in oral arguments in defense of the policy. The court's order comes a week after a Ninth Circuit panel <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/07/06/20110606_Order.pdf">lifted a stay</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-immediate-end-to-enforcement-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] blocking a lower court injunction against DADT, allowing for an immediate end to enforcement of the controversial policy. Monday's order was unsigned by the judges, and it is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5haitvvhqgJ3exMV419YipnMmIEAw?docId=708a750c8f54454e8534911e47bfc1a5">not known</a> [AP report] whether it came from the same judges who lifted the stay. 

<p>In November, the government requested and received the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/11/01/10-56634_order_granting_stay.pdf">stay</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">report</a>] that suspended enforcement of the injunction. The government had requested that the appeal be placed on hold in light of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, arguing that moving forward with the appeal would interfere with the repeal schedule that the Act sets in place. After hearing seven months of arguments and briefs, the Ninth Circuit rejected that appeal and lifted the stay. That decision came after the Ninth Circuit's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-declines-to-put-dont-ask-dont-tell-appeal-on-hold.php">denial</a> [JURIST report] of a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/03/10-56813_Abeyance.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] by the US government that the court suspend the government's appeal of an <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-orders-military-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Central District of California</a> [official website] requiring the US military to end enforcement of DADT. Congress recently tried to delay the repeal of DADT when it passed the $690 billion <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.1540:">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> [HR 1540 materials], which contains a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c112:2:./temp/~c112lBmZpg:e286772:">provision</a> [Sec. 533] requiring the chiefs of the branches of the military to submit written certification that DADT's repeal will not be harmful. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved in the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Israeli <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/main/eng/home.asp">Knesset</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5huQmcGZNWGBtu1GFURaCnOUO8E3g?docId=CNG.37ba0b8c634ad640bbd2c527ede773d8.5f1">passed the law</a> [AFP report] Monday making it illegal to boycott the West Bank settlements and its products in protest of further settlements in the contested region. The <a href="http://zope.gush-shalom.org/home/he/events/1310332766">challenge argues</a> [press release, in Hebrew] that the law harms democracy by silencing people who have a certain position and violates the freedom of expression and right to equality. The challenge says that boycotts are a fundamental part of democracy and pointed to boycotts of British products in India led by Mahatma Ghandi and the African American boycotts during the civil rights movement in the US. Numerous groups against further expansion into the West Bank, including <a href="http://peacenow.org.il/eng/">Peace Now</a> [advocacy website], have taken a position against the law. 

<p>The anti-boycott law was passed despite controversy over the legality of further settlement into the West Bank, home to many Palestinians. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-illegal-west.php">Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank "illegal"</a> [JURIST report]. The statement came two weeks after Israel announced the construction of 1,600 new housing units in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/jerusalem.htm">East Jerusalem</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], where Palestinians hope to establish the capital of their future state. Ban said, "the world has condemned Israel's settlement expansion plans in East Jerusalem. Let us be clear, all settlement activities [are] illegal anywhere in Occupied Territory... I urge all parties to respect sensitives and promote calm. We can and must find a way for Jerusalem to emerge from negotiations as the capital of two states with arrangements for holy sites acceptable to all." Also last year, Israel began rerouting a segment of its West Bank <a href="http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/default.htm">security barrier</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=security+fence+%2Bisrael">news archive</a>] shifting the controversial barrier's path <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israel-begins-moving-west-bank-security.php">several hundred yards west</a> [JURIST report] of its current location to return more than 800,000 square yards of land to Palestinian farmers. The move comes more than two years after the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/israel-high-court-orders-partial-re.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the government must change the route because it excessively encroached on Palestinian territory and infringed on residents' rights to access fields and orchards blocked by the barrier. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bradley+manning">news archive</a>] is accused of leaking a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzYTxuW2vmzk">controversial classified video</a> [YouTube video] of a 2007 US helicopter strike in Iraq and classified <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] documents on <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">Wikileaks</a> [website] last year. Manning was detained in pre-trial solitary confinement at <a href="http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/activities/?Section=SECBN">Quantico Confinement Facility</a> [official website], and subsequently <a href="http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4813">transferred</a> [DOJ press release] to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/CorrectionalFacility.pdf">Joint Regional Correctional Facility</a> [DOJ report, PDF] at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Mendez argues that the <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/UN-official-says-US-breaks-rules-in-torture-probe-1461996.php">US is obstructing his investigation</a> [AP report] of Manning's treatment during detention. Mendez emphasized his need for open conversation with the inmate:<blockquote>I am assured by the US Government that Mr. Manning's prison regime and confinement is markedly better than it was when he was in Quantico. However, in addition to obtaining first hand information on my own about his new conditions of confinement, I need to ascertain whether the conditions he was subjected to for several months in Quantico amounted to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. For that, it is imperative that I talk to Mr. Manning under conditions where I can be assured that he is being absolutely candid.</blockquote>The US military has prohibited unmonitored conversations between Mendez and Manning, who has been detained for the past year.

<p>A <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] panel of experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">declared Manning competent to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] in April. Manning faces <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/2010/Manning-charge-sheet.pdf">two charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-soldier-charged-for-releasing-classified-video-docs.php">report</a>] under the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) [text] for the transfer of classified information and exceeding his authorized computer access. His prosecution has sparked heated debate between defenders and critics. Those who support Manning's actions refer to him as <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/manning1/petition.html">courageous for acting as a whistleblower</a> [advocacy petition] against government crime and corruption. He has been compared to famous US whistleblowers such as <a href="http://www.frankserpico.com/">Frank Serpico</a> and <a href="http://www.ellsberg.net/">Daniel Ellsberg</a> [personal websites], who leaked information regarding corruption in the New York Police Department and the Pentagon, respectively. <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Secretary of Defense Robert Gates</a> [official profile] has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704895204575321080522272718.html">criticized the video</a> [WSJ report], claiming it provides the public a view of warfare "as seen through a soda straw." He noted that public attention was not drawn to what was discovered by US ground forces following the helicopter gunfire, including AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. He also defended the reality of fighting terrorist organizations, which is made up of combatants who do not wear enemy uniforms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Smith</a> [backgrounder], involving a same-sex couple who want both their names on the birth certificate of an adopted child. Though adopted in New York, the child was born in Louisiana, where the couple was refused their request. The couple appealed, and in April, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-30036-CV2.wpd.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/fifth-circuit-strikes-order-to-put-names-of-gay-adoptive-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">report</a>] <em>en banc</em> against the parents, finding that "adoption is not a fundamental right," and that "Louisiana has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children." In a <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/la_20110711_us-supreme-court.html">statement</a> [press release], Lambda Legal said, "We have long since abandoned the notion that the government can punish children to express disapproval of their parents or their families. The state of Louisiana cannot withhold a birth certificate for this child simply because it doesn't like who his parents are."

<p>The appeals court ruling in April overturned a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-orders-state-to.php">prior decision</a> [JURIST report] in February by a panel of three judges from the Fifth Circuit ordering that the revised birth certificate be issued. Lambda Legal, which represents the parents, <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/federal-judge-rules-oklahoma-gay.php">successfully argued a similar case</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, when the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/finstuen-victory.html">struck down an amendment</a> [press release] to the Oklahoma Constitution that would have prevented the state from recognizing adoptions by gay parents that were finalized in other US or foreign jurisdictions. Same-sex adoptive parents have recently been involved in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=adoption">numerous legal battles</a> [JURIST news archive]. In April, the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/arkansas-high-court-upholds-decision-to-strike-gay-adoption-ban.php">struck down a ban on adoptions</a> [JURIST report] by same-sex couples, finding the ban to be a violation of the state constitution. Last year, a Florida appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/florida-appeals-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">struck down a similar law</a> [JURIST report], finding that it failed rational basis review and violated the state constitution's equal protection clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which seeks to deter such crimes, was sent to the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian], the lower house of Parliament, for further debate. Medvedev first <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110712/165154754.html">proposed that the chemical castration procedure be voluntary</a> [<em>Ria Novosti</em> report], but the <a href="http://www.edinros.ru/">United Russia</a> [party website, in Russian] party, which holds a majority in parliament, contends that the procedure should be mandatory. In addition to providing a measure for compulsory medical treatment, the bill proposes life sentences as possible punishment for pedophiles who are repeat offenders. The <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?langpair=ru|en&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&u=http://www.komitet2-10.km.duma.gov.ru/&usg=ALkJrhhirLIkvQROWOTyXfVjUoBoGtN2sQ">State Duma Committee on Civil, Criminal, Arbitral and Procedural Legislation</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.komitet2-10.km.duma.gov.ru/site.xp/053048124053052056.html">said</a> [press release, in Russian] that pedophilia is a social evil and a disease that requires medical and psychiatric attention in addition to tougher penalties.

<p>The chemical castration process consists of a series of chemical injections that hinder the effects of the male hormone testosterone. In an earlier version of the bill, punishment for sexual crimes committed against children would <a href="http://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp2_l205402708_Criminal%20law%20and%20procedure">range from 20 years to life imprisonment</a> [Library of Congress report]. A person would be eligible for parole and conditional early release only upon his voluntary request for and agreement to undergo medical castration. Several countries including Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Poland and some US states use the chemical castration process. In his <a href="http://rt.com/politics/official-word/transcript-address-federal-assembly/">annual address to Parliament</a> [transcript text] last November, Medvedev emphasized the need for measures that protect children, including harsher penalties for those who commit sexual crimes against children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HTC <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/07/11/apple-accuses-htc-more-patent-violations-in-itc-suit/">denied</a> [Dow Jones report] this claim.

Last year, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/apple-files-patent-infringement-suit.php">filed suits</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> and with the USITC alleging patent infringements.

The Netherlands <a href="http://www.om.nl/">Public Prosecution Service</a> [official website, in Dutch] spokesman, Wim De Bruin, <a href="http://www.scanpix.no/spWebApp/preview.action?search.offset=35&search.rid=104346&search.rbase=DV&search.searchId=1058410522&search.previewNumResults=21662&search.tabId=video">said</a> [statement, video] the Somalis were between 20 and 30 years old and could face up to 15 years for "sea robbery." The Somalis are accused of hijacking the South African yacht, Choizil, and kidnapping two of its crew members. One of the crew members was rescued by an EU anti-piracy task force while the De Bruin said the other two are still in the custody of pirates. The court is asserting jurisdiction over the suspected pirates under a law that allows it to try cases of international law. 

<p>Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The Netherlands is one of the few countries that has attempted to try suspected pirates. Last year, a Netherlands court in Rotterdam <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">sentenced five convicted Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report] to five years in prison for hijacking a cargo ship registered in the Netherlands Antilles. The five men were arrested in 2009 during an attempt to forcibly board a cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden after a Danish navy frigate sunk their boat. The five men had <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/dutch-court-begins-europes-first-somali-pirate-trial.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report], saying they were fishermen who were seeking help after an equipment malfunction. They also challenged the court's jurisdiction and claimed that the severe poverty in Somalia had driven them to piracy. In rejecting these claims, the court emphasized the growing threat of piracy to international shipping that convicted pirates must face strict consequences. The few countries that have attempted to prosecute them include the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/three-somali-pirates-charged-in-highjacking-that-killed-4-americans.php">US</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nazif was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE76B0LX20110712">sentenced to one year</a> [Reuters report], while former interior minister Habib el Adly, who is already serving a 12-year prison sentence, was sentenced to five years. Former finance minister Yousef Boutros was tried and sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to 10 years. The three former officials, all of which <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/former-egypt-officials-charged-with-corruption.php">were charged in April</a> [JURIST report] and served under former Egyptian president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hosni+mubarak">news archive</a>], <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201141715562214192.html">granted a no-bid contract</a> [Al Jazeera report] to a German businessman to sell license plates in Egypt. The deal wasted USD $15 million of public funds by paying more for the plates than market price.

<p>The men were charged just days after the court ordered Mubarak moved to a hospital to recover from an unspecified ailment, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-postpones-questioning-after-mubarak-hospitalized.php">causing a delay in questioning</a> [JURIST report] regarding his alleged roles in protester deaths and embezzlement of government money.

The military intervention began on March 19 in response to violent reactions from Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] after pro-democracy protests erupted February 15, 2011, in the eastern city of Benghazi. A 2008 reform measure requires parliamentary debate and voting for any military operation ordered by France's president four months after the order is handed down. The debate <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20110712-french-national-assembly-approves-military-operation-libya-nato">focused on the cost of the operation</a> [France 24 report], with many voters having concerns that the cost of the operations would exceed the military budget. Both the  <a href="http://www.u-m-p.org/site/index.php">Union for a Popular Movement</a> (UMP) party and the <a href="http://www.parti-socialiste.fr/">Socialist party</a> [party websites, in French] supported authorization. The Senate will likely vote on the measure later Tuesday evening.

<p>Participation in military operations in Libya has been the focal point of contentious debate in the US. The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] in two votes in June <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/house-votes-down-authorization-for-libya-but-continues-to-fund-it.php">sent contradictory messages</a> [JURIST report] over authorization of US military operations in Libya, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll493.xml">voting down 123-295</a> [roll call vote] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.J.RES.68:">resolution</a> [HJ RES 68] that would have authorized further operations in Libya, and later <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll494.xml">voting down 180-238</a> [roll call vote] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.2278:">measure</a> [HR 2278] that would have defunded the operations, save for rescue and intelligence efforts to assist NATO. Obama disagrees with certain members of Congress regarding his legal authority to continue military operations in Libya. Obama's position is that he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-releases-report-justifying-actions-and-cost-in-libya.php">not in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the War Powers Resolution. His office maintains that US activities in Libya do not amount to "hostilities" because the US is only playing a supporting role in the NATO-led mission pursuant to and limited by the UN Security Council Resolution authorizing military action in Libya to protect civilians. But earlier in June, it was reported that Obama came to this conclusion <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-lawyers-divided-over-legality-of-us-operations-in-libya.php">overriding the legal interpretations</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel</a> [official websites]. Last month, Speaker of the House <a target="_blank" href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] had threatened to defund the mission after sending Obama a letter earlier in the month warning him that he was within five days of violating the War Powers Act. Also last month, <a href="http://kucinich.house.gov">Dennis Kucinich</a> (D-OH) and <a href="http://jones.house.gov">Walter Jones</a> (R-NC) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/lawmakers-file-suit-against-obama-for-continuing-actions-in-libya.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking to enjoin further action in Libya. Obama's report endorsed a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:194:./list/bss/d112SE.lst::">pending resolution</a> [bill materials] that would provide some congressional support for continued efforts in Libya, though not approval of declaring war. The report also detailed that the US has spent USD $716 million and will spend $1.1 billion by the end of September.</p>

She stressed, though, that Habre should not be expected to live with impunity in Senegal, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed its decision</a> [JURIST report] Sunday to send Habre back to Chad after Pillay warned he could be tortured and would not receive a fair trial. On Senegal's reversal, Rupert Colville, Pillay's spokesperson, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11233&LangID=E">said</a> [press release]: <blockquote>It is important that rapid and concrete progress is made by Senegal to prosecute or extradite Habre to a country willing to conduct a fair trial. This has been High Commissioner's position all along. It is also the position of the African Union, as well of much of the rest of the international community; It is a violation of international law to shelter a person who has committed torture or other crimes against humanity, without prosecuting or extraditing him.</blockquote>Colville also mentioned that Belgium is the only country willing to try Habre as he is also wanted there under a universal jurisdiction law that allows Belgian courts to hear cases over violations of international law. 

<p>Senegal <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZdYzAbPVET-CAHKVNwBvXralETw?docId=CNG.5daf9b1852bed4e2e24c039d0b187f02.661">suspended plans to extradite late Sunday</a> [AFP report] just hours before Habre was set to board a plane. The decision came after Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued a plea</a> [JURIST report] not to return Habre to Chad, which has already sentenced him to death <em>in absentia</em>. Senegal had announced Friday it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-to-deport-former-chad-president-habre.php">deporting Habre to Chad</a> [JURIST report] to face charges. However, Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11217&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] that Habre would not receive a fair trial and that extradition may violate international law. Habre has been accused of involvement in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents during his rule from 1982 to 1990. He later fled to Senegal after being removed from power in 1990.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group released a report that says it has evidence authorities used the state machinery to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE76B0PL20110712?sp=true">influence the referendum</a> [Reuters report] on the country's new constitution, calling for an immediate judicial investigation into the referendum's legitimacy. The AMDH alleges that authorities used state media to sway public opinion and used religious pressure to encourage people to vote in favor of passage. Moroccan voters on July 1 <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/morocco-voters-overwhelmingly-approve-revised-constitution.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] a revised version of the constitution, highlighted by fewer powers reserved for King Mohammed VI. But some argue that the referendum only reflected half the vote, despite reports by the Interior Ministry, which ran the election. 

<p>Under the new constitution, Mohammed, who previously enjoyed almost absolute power, remains head of the army, but a variety of his other political powers are now held by the prime minister and parliament. In addition to curbing the king's powers, the revision also guarantees more rights for women and makes Berber, an indigenous language, official. Mohammed <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/morocco-king-announces-constitutional-reforms.php">announced the changes</a> [JURIST report] last month, which many viewed as an attempt to put an end to the "Arab Spring" street protests that had been becoming more prevalent throughout the region. Prior to the king's announcement, in April, thousands of protesters <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/morocco-protesters-seek-radical-constitutional-reform.php">engaged in peaceful demonstrations</a> [JURIST report], vocalizing their demands for greater reform to the constitution as well as an end to corruption within the country. Similar protests have occurred recently throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], and have resulted in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports]. Protests were also widespread in <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya</a> [JURIST backgrounder], where leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and his inner circle have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-rights-chief.php">accused of perpetrating violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW Asia director Brad Adams said, "we want these trials to succeed in bringing the people responsible for the horrific crimes of 1971 to justice. While the amendments are a significant improvement, key problems still need to be fixed to ensure fair trials and avoid unnecessarily lengthy appeals." The ICTB is scheduled to hold a hearing Thursday to review the charges against Sayedee.

<p>HRW had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hrw-urges-further-amendments-to-bangladesh-international-crimes-tribunal.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to the Bangladesh government, in May, praising the establishment of the ICTB to to prosecute those responsible for atrocities committed during the 1971 struggle for independence, but urged the government to ensure that the trials are carried out in accordance with international human rights expectations. The letter, sent to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, did praise the parliament's passage of amendments to its <a href="http://www.internationallawbureau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-International-Crimes-Tribunals-Act-1973.pdf">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act of 1973</a> (ICA) [text, PDF], including instituting civilian judges rather than military judges and mandating independence for the tribunal's judicial functions.

Trustee <a href = "http://www.madofftrustee.com/">Irving Picard</a> [official website] has regained more than $7.6 billion from the Madoff estate. In May, Picard released his fifth <a href = "http://www.madofftrustee.com/CourtFilings-Download.aspx?Docket=870">interim report</a> [text, PDF], stating he has filed "over one thousand lawsuits to recover avoidable transfers and other monies in claimed amounts totaling over $90 billion for the benefit of the Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC [BLIMIS] estate."

Barbara Picower agreed to return all profits received from the Madoff firm but insists that her husband was unaware of Madoff's fraudulent activities and was never charged with a crime. The month before, Picard filed close to 60 lawsuits in an <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">attempt to recover more than $40 billion</a> [JURIST report] from numerous banks, hedge funds and individuals, coinciding with the two-year deadline for seeking compensation.

In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/burma0711_OnlineVersion.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "Dead Men Walking: Convict Porters on the Front Lines in Eastern Burma," HRW and KHRG argue that convicts imprisoned in Myanmar are tortured and forced to participate in dangerous military operations and act as "human shields" to protect soldiers or trip landmines. The convicts are randomly selected to serve as porters in the military government's counterinsurgency against the country's ethnic minority and receive no compensation for their work. Vignettes from escaped prisoners provide insight into the dismal front-line conditions and ill-treatment by the Myanmar military. Wounded porters are often abandoned, and prisoners who try to escape are executed, the report alleges. Poe Shan, director of KHRG, said the conduct is ongoing and constitutes only one component of military abuses:<blockquote>The barbaric practice of using convict porters has been a feature of armed conflict in Burma for at least 20 years, exposing them to the hazards of armed conflict with complete disregard for their safety. The army forces other civilians to work as porters as well, but since civilians often flee conflict areas, the use of prisoners continues. Recent accounts from former convict porters show that the Burmese army's abusive tactics have not changed since last year's sham elections. The brutal treatment of porters is just one facet of army atrocities against civilians in ethnic conflict areas.</blockquote> The rights groups alleged that the conduct violates international humanitarian and human rights law, called for an independent, impartial investigation into the alleged abuses and urged the international community to support a UN commission of inquiry.

<p>Continued ethnic violence in Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-ethnic-violence-limiting-transition-to-democracy-un-rights-expert.php">presents "serious limitations"</a> [JURIST report] to the government's transition to democracy, according to <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tomas+ojea+quintana">news archive</a>], the UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar. In May, Myanmar began releasing close to 15,000 prisoners, but many human rights groups claim the government is still holding many more political prisoners. Quintana urged Myanmar's military government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">release 2,202 political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] last December. Quintana called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," many of whom, he says, suffer from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy. In March, Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">underwent a transfer of power</a> [BBC report] from a military regime to a civil system after holding its first elections in 20 years. However, critics argue that the new regime is merely a sham since it is made up of military generals with the military party winning 80 percent of the vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontchinaflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/">State Council Information Office</a> (SICO) [official website, in Chinese] of China said Wednesday that they are in the process of drafting a new human rights plan to be fully implemented by 2015. Declaring the <a href = "http://english.gov.cn/official/2009-04/13/content_1284128.htm">National Human Rights Action Plan of China</a> (NHRAP) [text] of 2009 <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/wz/201107/t955216.htm">completed</a> [press release, in Chinese], the director of SICO, Wang Chen, announced the <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/wz/201107/t955955.htm">development of the new plan</a> [transcript text, in Chinese] in a speech to the NHRAP assessment review meeting. Although Wang praised China's government for their new human rights stances, he also noted there are areas that could be improved under the new plan:<blockquote>Of course, we are soberly aware that China is a developing country, China's human rights is also a developing process. Unbalanced development and lack of coordination issues are still outstanding, such as resource and environmental constraints of economic growth, a greater gap in income distribution, inflation pressures, prices in some cities have risen too high, food safety issues are more prominent, higher quality education, a total lack of medical resources, uneven distribution of development between urban and rural areas, illegal land acquisition and other social conflicts caused by increased population. It should also be noted that in the protection of people's democratic rights, China is still insufficient. By natural, historical, cultural, economic and social development and constraints, China's human rights development still faces many difficulties and challenges, and enjoying full human rights to achieve the lofty goals remains to be done.</blockquote>At the review meeting, further recommendations were made by committees on <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/wz/201107/t956014.htm">disabled persons</a>, <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/wz/201107/t956015.htm">poverty</a>, <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/wz/201107/t956016.htm">labor rights and protections</a>, and the <a href = "http://www.scio.gov.cn/zxbd/wz/201107/t956017.htm">judiciary</a> [speech transcripts, in Chinese], including creating better standards for applying the death penalty. China has consistently defined "human rights" as <a href = "http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/chinese-official-says-country-is-drawing-up-plan-to-improve-human-rights-record/2011/07/13/gIQAwX8vBI_story.html">improving living conditions overall</a> [WP report], rather than granting citizens greater freedoms, much to the criticism of the international community. In January, <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] declared that China had <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/china-fails-to-deliver-on-human-rights-promises-hrw.php">failed to achieve the goals it set out in the NHRAP</a> [JURIST report], decrying China's continued use of torture, illegal detentions and the government's overuse of the death penalty. HRW also noted China's lack of commitment in cooperating with the international human rights community, as well as a number of human rights issues not slated for improvement in the NHRAP. The rights group did praise China for working to eradicate poverty, although conceded that further steps should be made.

<p>Since then, there have been continuous allegations of human rights in China. The Chinese government implemented measures aimed at <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/china-suppressing-lawyers-pursuing-human-rights-cases-ai.php">suppressing lawyers pursuing human rights cases</a> [JURIST report], <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/018/2011/en/20ed6bf3-aaa9-4da5-8220-6c07615e531b/asa170182011en.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] last month. Chinese lawyers and law firms undergo "annual assessments" which, the government claims, are conducted by independent lawyers associations. AI contends, however, that the lawyers defending human rights disproportionately fail the assessment and expressed general concern with the treatment of human rights lawyers in China. In May 2010, two Chinese human rights lawyers who have represented <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong</a> [group website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/401268.stm">backgrounder</a>] defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/China-disbars-rights-lawyers .php">permanently disbarred</a> [JURIST report] after being accused of disrupting courtrooms. AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/chinese-human-rights-defenders-subjected-absurd-disbarment-hearing-2010-04-22">criticized the disbarment hearing</a> [press release] calling it "absurd" and claiming that "[g]overnment authorities in China continue to harass and disrupt the work of lawyers taking politically sensitive cases." In April 2009, the <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/">Information Office of the State Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/china-issues-first-human-rights.php">published the National Human Rights Action Plan of China (NHRAP)</a> [JURIST report], which aimed to protect ethnic minorities, promote gender equality, guarantee suspects the right to an impartial trial, and prohibit illegal detentions and the use of torture to extract confessions from suspects. In February 2009, the Chinese delegation to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-defends-rights-record-in-review.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] China's human rights record while presenting a <a href="http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/CN/A_HRC_WG6_4_CHN_1_E.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] in compliance with the UNHRC's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [official website] process. Ambassador Li Baodong said that China has been taking steps to improve its legal system, promote democracy, and encourage non-governmental organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.avp.org/documents/NCAVPHateViolenceReport2011Finaledjlfinaledits.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] presented findings that hate violence against LGBT individuals increased by 13 percent from 2009 to 2010 and anti-LGBT murders increased by 23 percent. Moreover, 44 percent of LGBT murder victims were transgender women, while 70 percent of LGBT murder victims were people of color. Over 50 percent of survivors of anti-LGBT violence do not report the incidents, and many victims were reportedly treated with indifferent or negative police attitudes. Sandhya Luther from the <a href="http://www.coavp.org/">Colorado Anti-Violence Program</a> (COAVP) [advocacy website], a member of the NCAVP, emphasized the need for measures that seek to reduce anti-LGBT violence:<blockquote>The findings of this report are troubling and reveal a need for the serious commitment of organizations, institutions, funders and policymakers towards research and the prevention of violence against LGBTQ and HIV-affected individuals. Our recommendations represent crucial steps for ending violence against LGBTQ and HIV-affected people in this country.</blockquote>The report provided recommendations for responding to and preventing anti-LGBT violence, including creating new funding programs for victims, creating laws to facilitate access to law enforcement resources and increasing campaigns to raise awareness about anti-LGBT violence.

<p>Similar trends have been reported internationally. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] warned in May that hate crimes against LGBT individuals are <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hate-crimes-against-lgbt-people-rise-worldwide-un-rights-chief.php">on the rise worldwide</a> [JURIST report] by pointing to statistics showing that <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38406&amp;Cr=Pillay&amp;Cr1">homophobic-based crimes are increasing</a> [UN News Centre report], and urging that states act to stop this trend. In the US, some measures have been taken to stop hate crimes against LGBT individuals. In March, US <a href="http://polis.house.gov/">Representative Jared Polis</a> (D-CO) and <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Al Franken</a> (D-MN) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-legislators-introduce-bill-ending-bullying-in-federally-funded-schools.php">introduced legislation to protect LGBT students</a> [JURIST report] in federally funded public elementary and high schools from bullying. In 2009, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-defense-authorization-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that contained a measure extending the definition of federal hate crimes to include crimes motivated by gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Homosexuality remains a crime in many countries including Uganda, which has been harshly criticized throughout the international community since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8308912.stm">introduction</a> [BBC report] in October 2009 of its <a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/btb/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Bill-No-18-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill-2009.pdf">Anti-Homosexuality Bill</a> [text, PDF], which has since been stalled in the Parliament. The bill would impose harsh penalties for homosexuality, including death in some circumstances, and imposes punishments of up to three years in prison for individuals, including family members, who fail to report offenders. Uganda currently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8412962.stm">criminalizes homosexual behavior</a> [BBC report] with up to 14 years in prison. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rebel fighters have reportedly committed abuses against civilians and civilian property in captured towns over the past month, including damaging property, burning homes, looting from hospitals, homes and shops, and beating supporters of the government. Rebel military forces have admitted to the attacks, but it is unclear whether many of the perpetrators have been punished for their conduct. Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at HRW, Joe Stork, said rebel leaders are not fulfilling their obligations and expressed concern that the violence will continue:<blockquote>The rebel authorities have a duty to protect civilians and their property, especially hospitals, and discipline anyone responsible for looting or other abuse. Opposition forces have an obligation to protect civilians and their property in the areas they control so people feel they can return home safely and rebuild their lives. Opposition forces say they are committed to human rights, but the looting, arson, and abuse of civilians in captured towns are worrying. This raises concerns about how civilians will be treated if rebels capture other towns where the government has support.</blockquote>Col. El-Moktar Firnana, a commander of the rebel military, indicated that most of the stolen property belonged to Libya's military government under the direction of Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], and that he and other rebel officers had issued directives not to attack civilians or civilian property. HRW alleges, however, that some of the rebel attacks were indiscriminate. HRW has also reported that the Libyan government has committed indiscriminate attacks on civilians and has illegally occupied areas in the country.

<p>Both the rebel forces and government authorities have been chastised for mistreating civilians. In June, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/libya-opposition-forces-committing-arbitrary-detention-torture-hrw.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the arrests of dozens of civilians by Libyan opposition authorities, and called on the National Transitional Council (NTC), the opposition ruling body in Libya with de facto control over eastern Libya, to provide civilian detainees with full due process rights, access to counsel and the ability to challenge their detention before independent judicial authorities. On the other side of the conflict, a three-person commission for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] appointed to investigate violence in Libya published a report Wednesday finding that Gaddafi's forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">committed crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] and war crimes under orders from Gaddafi and other high-ranking officials. The commission's 92-page report said Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances, and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." Also last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-urges-libya-to-implement-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] personal aides of Gaddafi to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">implement the arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] issued against the leader and several government officials.</p>

The court issued a unanimous ruling ordering that military officers and personnel <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-military-trials-20110713,0,4584113.story">be tried in civilian courts</a> [LAT report] when accused of torture, extrajudicial killing and other human rights abuses. Prior to the ruling they had been tried in military tribunals, which have received criticism for failing to try and convict military personnel for alleged crimes and abuses. Many of the problems of alleged military abuse stem from President Felipe Calderon's use of the military to combat drug cartels. Still, the ruling stops short of <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_MEXICO_HUMAN_RIGHTS?SITE=NJMOR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">forcing all cases out of the military court system</a> [AP report], and it remains unclear when the civilian courts will begin hearing military cases. 

<p>The Mexican military has come under criticism from rights groups for failing to hold its members accountable for alleged human rights abuses. In 2009, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] published a report saying the use of the military to fight drug cartels has <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/rights-group-urges-mexico-to-hold.php">resulted in human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] by soldiers, including killings, torture, rapes, and arbitrary detentions. The report states that these abuses have gone unpunished, with no convictions resulting from any investigations. The report underscores the importance of holding human rights violators accountable saying, "such horrific abuses directly undermine the goal of stopping drug-related violence and improving public security. The army is currently deployed in the areas of the country most torn by drug-related violence. It would be in the military's best interest to act and be seen to act in a manner that is professional and respectful of civilians and human rights."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontutah.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A polygamous family filed a <a href = "http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/documents/211cv652_docketedcomplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint text, PDF] on Wednesday in the <a href = "http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] seeking to overturn the state's <a href = "http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010100.htm">prohibition on bigamy</a> [Utah Code 76-7-101] as a violation of their civil rights. While the complaint acknowledges that the US Supreme Court upheld the criminalization of polygamy in <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=98+U.S.+145&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=1104642225155375579&scilh=0">Reynolds v. US</a> [text], it suggests that criminal sanctions for committing any private, intimate behavior between consenting adults was struck down in <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html">Lawrence v. Texas</a> [text], when the court ruled that states could not criminalize sodomy. The parties also state they do not seek official federal or state recognition of their marriage, but an end to prosecutions for having a "plural family."<blockquote>The criminal bigamy law criminalizes not just polygamous marriages but also an array of plural intimate relationships and associations of consenting adults. By criminalizing religious-based plural families and intimate relationships under the criminal bigamy law, Utah officials prosecute private conduct between consenting adults without requiring law enforcement officials to show harm to society or those involved. The disparate treatment of polygamists denies them the basic liberties and equal protection under the law guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>The plaintiffs in the case, Kody Brown and his three wives, are the stars of the reality show <a href = "http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/sister-wives">Sister Wives</a> [website]. An <a href = "http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50366251-76/bigamy-brown-wives-paul.html.csp">investigation</a> [<em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> report] against him for bigamy has been ongoing since September 2010. In a <a href = "http://jonathanturley.org/2011/07/13/brown-family-challenges-utahs-polygamy-law/">statement</a> [press release], Brown said, "We only wish to live our private lives according to our beliefs. While we understand that this may be a long struggle in court, it has already been a long struggle for my family and other plural families to end the stereotypes and unfair treatment given consensual polygamy." A federal judge in Utah <a href = "/thisday/2011/02/16/federal-judge-rejected-challenge-to-utah-polygamy-ban.php">rejected a similar challenge</a> [JURIST report] in 2005.

<p>Polygamy, the practice of having more than one wife, is currently legal and recognized in much of Africa and the Middle East, while it is widely illegal in North and South America, Europe and China. Polygamy&#8212;called bigamy when illegal&#8212;is criminalized in every state in the US. The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/committee.htm">Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women</a> [official website] in 2008 urged <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=saudi+arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href = "/paperchase/2008/02/un-rights-panel-urges-saudi-arabia-to.php">to outlaw polygamy</a> [JURIST report], which it said is by its very nature counter to gender equality. The year before Indonesia <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/indonesia-high-court-upholds-limits-on.php">upheld marriage laws limiting polygamy</a> [JURIST report], despite teachings in the predominantly Islamic country's largest religion allowing men to take up to four wives. However, in 2006, a Canadian study <A href = "/paperchase/2006/01/canadian-study-recommends-legalizing.php">urged the Canadian federal government to legalize polygamy</a> [JURIST report] to help protect women and children in those relationships.</p>]]></content:encoded>

[media website] and its subsidiaries violated US laws by hacking into the mobile phones of <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] victims. The requests are in response to an <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/most-popular/2011/07/11/phone-hacking-9-11-victims-may-have-had-mobiles-tapped-by-news-of-the-world-reporters-115875-23262694/">article</a> [text] published in the British tabloid, <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/"><em>The Daily Mirror</em></a> [official website], claiming that journalists working for the company offered to pay a New York City police officer in exchange for victims' phone information and call details. US Senator <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/">Robert Menendez</a> (D-NJ) [official website] sent a <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=80049f34-2b93-4c67-8a50-43559a16755b">letter</a> [text] to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] requesting an investigation into whether the allegations are true.  Representative Peter King (R-NY), Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, sent a <a href="http://homeland.house.gov/press-release/king-demands-investigation-claims-hacking-911-victims">letter</a> [text] to the FBI urging an investigation and stating that, if true, News Corp.'s actions would merit felony charges for corruption of public officials and wiretapping. King stated that any guilty parties "should receive the harshest sanctions available under law" and called for the protection of 9/11 families.<blockquote>It is revolting to imagine that members of the media would seek to compromise the integrity of a public official for financial gain in the pursuit of yellow journalism.  The 9/11 families have suffered egregiously, but unfortunately they remain vulnerable against such unjustifiable parasitic strains.  We can spare no effort or expense in continuing our support for them.</blockquote>US Senators <a href="http://boxer.senate.gov/">Barbara Boxer</a> (D-CA) and <a href="http://rockefeller.senate.gov/">Jay Rockefeller</a> (D-WV) [official websites] sent a <a href="http://boxer.senate.gov/en/press/releases/071311.cfm">letter</a> [text] to Holder and the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] asking both to investigate the wiretapping allegations and to determine whether News. Corp violated the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/docs/lay-persons-guide.pdf">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977</a> (FCPA) [background materials, PDF] by using bribery to collect private information in the UK. Senator <a href="http://lautenberg.senate.gov/">Frank Lautenberg</a> (D-NJ) wrote a similar <a href="http://lautenberg.senate.gov/assets/newscorp-071311.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Holder and the SEC. 

<p>These requests follow recent reports that journalists for the now-defunct British tabloid, <a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/">News of the World</a> [media website], a News Corp. subsidiary, paid London police officers for private information, including telephone records, to use in various news stories. The company could face additional charges under the accounting provisions of the FPCA for not properly recording any illicit transactions in their books.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appellants, secret service organizations including <a href = "https://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website], appealing a May 2010 <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/uk-appeals-court-denies-use-of-secret-evidence-in-detainee-torture-case.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], requested the creation of a  "closed material procedure," saying the disclosure of their evidence to the appellees, former Guantanamo detainees, would be contrary to the public interest. This procedure would have involved a special advocate being appointed to the plaintiffs in a civil case to impartially consider the defendants' evidence but not reveal any of it to the plaintiffs. The court rejected this idea, citing the public interest immunity (PII) doctrine as more than suitable for classified information as evidence, and that it was not in the judiciary's power to allow or enforce a new doctrine. The PII allows for information to not be disclosed to opposing parties when it would not be in the public's interest.<blockquote>[T]he right to be confronted by one's accusers is such a fundamental element of the common law right to a fair trial that the court cannot abrogate it in the exercise of its inherent power. Only Parliament can do that. The closed material procedure excludes a party from the closed part of the trial. He cannot see the witnesses who speak in that part of the trial; nor can he see closed documents; he cannot hear or read the closed evidence or the submissions made in the closed hearing; and finally he cannot see the judge delivering the closed judgment nor can he read it.</blockquote>The court did suggest Parliament could create a law to allow "secret evidence" if it chose. <em>The Guardian</em>, an intervening party in the suit for the plaintiffs, was <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/jul/13/supreme-court-secret-evidence-ban">pleased with the decision</a> [report], calling it a victory for open justice.

<p>The initial suit, a civil case brought by British resident and Iraqi citizen Bisher al-Rawi with other Guantanamo detainees, Binyam Mohamed, Jamil el-Banna, Richard Belmar, Omar Deghayes and Martin Mubanga, was appealed by MI5 and <a href = "http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/sis-home-welcome.html">MI6</a> [official website] after the detainees asserted that the organizations "aided and abetted" their illegal detention. Their claims for recompense were <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] in November by the UK government. Bisher al-Rawi was <a href = "/paperchase/2007/04/uk-resident-released-from-guantanamo.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007 from the US military prison at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] after nearly five years in custody as an enemy combatant. Al-Rawi was originally suspected of ties to al Qaeda because of his alleged connection with radical Muslim cleric <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4141594.stm">Abu Qatada</a> [BBC profile]. He was arrested returning to the UK from Gambia with a suspicious electronic device, which they claimed was a battery charger, and were taken into US custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chiesi was accused of communicating non-public information about <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.amd.com">Advanced Microdevices</a> (AMD) and <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Sun Microsystems</a> (now Sun-Oracle) [corporate websites] in 2008 and 2009 to her superiors at <a href="http://investment-advisors.findthebest.com/detail/11118/NEW-CASTLE-FUNDS-LLC">New Castle Funds LLC</a> [fund profile], a Manhattan-based investment advisory company formerly part of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/bear_stearns_companies/index.html">Bear Stearns</a> [NYT backgrounder]. Chiesi was arrested in 2009 along with Galleon Group founder <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive] and accused of using the information to reap more than $4 million in illegal profits for New Castle. The settlement Chiesi agreed to pay <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304911104576444042085066556.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">amounted to a large portion of her net worth</a> [WSJ report], including salary and bonuses she received during the conspiracy activity. She <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January to three criminal counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud before judge Richard Holwell of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. Chiesi faces over three years in prison for the criminal charges when she is sentenced on July 20 in federal court.

<p>A federal jury <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report</a>] Rajaratnam in May on all 14 counts of insider trading. New Castle is said to have gained at least $1.7 million from the trades. Chiesi reportedly got the information from former IBM executive Robert Moffat, with whom she was having an affair. Moffat is currently serving six months in prison for insider trading in connection with the Galleon case. Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in September 2010 and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after he <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] the previous March. Former <a href="http://www.intel.com/about/companyinfo/capital/index.htm">Intel Capital</a> [corporate website] executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-intel-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in connection with the Galleon probe earlier in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material non-public information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. Rajaratnam and Chiesi initially <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009 after being indicted for insider trading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Estemirova, who was kidnapped in Grozny in July 2009 and shot to death, reported regularly on human rights abuses committed by the Chechen government, including extrajudicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances. Her body, which had been shot multiple times, was <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/600/42/379571.htm">found</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] in nearby Ingushetia. Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at HRW, expressed concern that the investigation has not yielded satisfactory evidence:<blockquote>Two years after Estemirova's murder, there are more questions than answers about the circumstances surrounding her killing. The Russian authorities need to deliver justice in Estemirova's case to demonstrate their sincerity about protecting human rights in Chechnya and throughout the North Caucasus.</blockquote>The advocacy groups emphasized the need for a "thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation" so the perpetrators could be held accountable. Joint Mobile Group of the Russian Human Rights Organizations in Chechnya, a group whose members are regularly threatened for pursuing human rights issues, is currently handling the Estemirova case, along with a number of other human rights cases.

<p>Estemirova is one of several rights advocates to be gunned down in Russia in recent years. Prominent opposition leader and human rights activist in Russia's southern province of <a href="http://www.ingushetia.ru/">Ingushetia</a> [official website, in Russian], Maksharip Aushev, was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/russia-rights-activist-killed-in-north.php">shot dead</a> [JURIST report] in October 2009 while traveling on a highway in the North Caucasus region of Kabardino-Balkaria. In August 2009, Chechen human rights activist Zarema Sadulayeva and her husband Alik Dzhabrailov were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/russia-human-rights-activist-found-dead.php">found dead</a> [JURIST report]. Sadulayeva's death came less than a month after Estemirova's death. The body of Russian human rights activist <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/missing-russia-human-rights-activist.php">Andrei Kulagin</a> [JURIST report] was found in a quarry in June 2009. Russian Human Rights Commissioner Vladimir Lukin expressed concern in April 2009 that activists in Russia were being <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/russia-rights-commissioner-concerned.php">attacked with greater frequency</a> [JURIST report]. In January 2009, Russian human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/russia-human-rights-lawyer-murdered.php">shot and killed</a> [JURIST report] in Moscow. Markelov represented journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5416238.stm">Anna Politkovskaya</a> [BBC obituary], who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/russia-top-prosecutor-probing-murder.php">shot to death</a> [JURIST report] in October 2006.

The <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=$$ADC20-816$$@TXADC020-816+&LIST=LAW+&BROWSER=BROWSER+&TOKEN=06376449+&TARGET=VIEW">law</a> [Local Law 17 &#167; 20-816] requires facilities meeting the definition of a "pregnancy center" to disclose certain information to patients: that <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/home/home.shtml">New York City Department of Health and Hygiene</a> [official website] advises woman to consult with a licensed medical provider; whether the facility has a licensed medical provider on staff; and whether the facility provides "referrals for abortion, emergency contraception, and prenatal care." The court granted a preliminary injunction holding that such requirements likely infringe on the non-profit facilities' <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights under a strict scrutiny standard. New York City argued that the law should be held to a lower standard of scrutiny since the restriction was on a form of commercial speech. The city argued that though the facilities operate for a charitable purpose, they provide services and goods with economic value and in return have the opportunity to advocate against abortion and either prevent or delay a decision to terminate a pregnancy." But Judge William Pauley said that just because a facility provides a good or service with economic value does not make it a commercial entity: <blockquote>the Plaintiffs engage in commercial speech because they are provided with an audience to whom they can espouse their beliefs&#8212;is particularly offensive to free speech principles. While Defendants apparently regard an assembly of people as an economic commodity, this court does not. Under such a view flyers for political rallies, religious literature promoting church attendance, or similar forms of expression would constitute commercial speech merely because they assemble listeners for the speaker. Accepting that proposition would permit the Government to inject its own message into virtually all speech designed to advocate a message to more than a single individual and thereby eviscerate the First Amendment's protections.</blockquote>The lawsuit was brought by a group of non-profit pregnancy facilities represented by the <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center of Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website]. The ACLJ <a href="http://aclj.org/pro-life/more-first-amendment-pro-life-win-in-nyc">touted the decision</a> [press release] as a First Amendment win for pro-life advocates. 

<p>There are currently several lawsuits challenging state laws placing restrictions on abortions. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block a new Texas requiring a woman to have a sonogram with the doctor describing the fetus in detail before having an abortion. The lawsuit claims that by forcing the physician to deliver government-mandated materials to the patient, it violates the First Amendment rights of both the patient and of the physician. It forces patients to hear what CRR claims is politically-motivated speech before making a decision and forces physicians to deliver unwanted information. Last month, the CRR won a preliminary injunction in the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] to block a Kansas <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/sb36/">regulation</a> [SB36] requiring clinics within the state to obtain a license to perform abortions. Earlier that week, a judge for the <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/drupal6/">US District Court for the District of South Dakota</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-south-dakota-abortion-law-with-72-hour-waiting-period.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking a South Dakota <a href="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Bill=1217">abortion regulation</a> [HB 1217] requiring a 72-hour waiting period.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW reported that in June authorities detained and investigated <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/NasserAbuL">Nasser Abul</a> [Twitter feed, in Arabic] for threatening state security using Twitter and Lawrence al-Rashidi for posting a YouTube video criticizing Kuwait leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4645048.stm">Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad Al-Sabah</a> [BBC profile]. HRW said that Kuwait should investigate the alleged mistreatment of Abul in detention, who it says is being held for Tweets criticizing the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. His Tweets support the protestors demonstrations against Bahrain <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa</a> [official profile]. Joe Stork, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said, "Abul has been held for more than a month on the basis of a few tweets that clearly constitute protected speech. His detention appears to be an illegal effort to punish him and intimidate others who might dare be critical about Kuwait's fellow Gulf monarchs." HRW also reports that Abul is being subjected to sleep deprivation and being held in solitary confinement. Al-rashidi is allegedly being held for posting a YouTube video calling for Al-Sabah to step down. 

<p>The two men are not the first to be persecuted for criticizing the demonstrations in the Middle East. In April, HRW reported that <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-military-court-convicts-blogger-for-insulting-army.php">an Egyptian military court convicted blogger</a> [JURIST report] Maikel Nabil and sentenced him to three years in prison for criticizing the army and raising questions over reform in the wake of revolution. The 25-year-old blogger and activist was arrested at his home on March 28 and charged with "insulting the military establishment" and "spreading false information" for criticizing the army's handling of the revolution that began on January 25. He posted an article on his blog on March 7 saying the army had beat, tortured and killed protesters, including some who were cooperating with security forces. He was then sentenced without a formal hearing and without his lawyers present. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Belgian <a href="http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/index.cfm?language=fr">House of Representatives</a> [official website, in French] voted 136-0 to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/belgium-lower-house-approves-burqa-ban.php">approve the law in April 2010</a> [JURIST report] and the <a href="http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&amp;LANG=fr">Senate</a> [official website, in French] <a href = "http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1641463.php/Belgian-burqa-ban-set-to-become-law">approved it in May</a> [DPA report] of that year, but the law's implementation was delayed by Belgium's political crisis. Violators of the new law will be fined &#8364; 137.50 and could receive a week in jail. The law is set to go into effect on July 23.

<p>A French Muslim couple living in the UK <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/france-muslim-couple-to-challenge-burqa-ban-in-echr-spain-court-uupholds-city-ban.php">filed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] last month in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] over the French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/dissimulation_visage_espace_public.asp">ban</a> [materials, in French] on full face coverings. Also in June, a Spanish court upheld a city ban on veils in municipal buildings for identification and security purposes. Under the French ban, people caught wearing facial coverings in public can be fined &#8364; 150 (USD $215) and/or ordered to take a citizenship class. In addition, anyone convicted of forcing a someone else to cover their face may be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEgiMW33brZhPohZrPSXS_zbE8lQ?docId=CNG.454c1042a774374e5f29a46c701d14b2.7b1">fined up to 30,000 euro and jailed for one year</a> [AFP report, in French], and the penalties double if the incident involves a minor. The ban affects citizens, residents and tourists alike, and extends to <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/04/08/01016-20110408ARTFIG00630-voile-signes-religieux-ce-qui-est-interdit-en-france.php">all public places</a> [<em>Le Figaro</em> backgrounder, in French], including airports, hospitals, government offices and even places of worship that are open to the public. In October, the French Constitutional Council ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ban conforms with the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Also in October, Dutch politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=5&Itemid=103">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website, in Dutch] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition.

Saharkhiz alleged that the treatment of both political and general prisoners in Iran <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/jailed_iranian_journalist_appeals_to_un_rapporteur/24264623.html">amounts to crimes against humanity</a> [RFE/RL report], and compared the conduct of prison authorities to that of Joseph Stalin in Soviet-era concentration camps. Saharkhiz believes that prison authorities are systematically mistreating prisoners, particularly political activists, with the goal of silencing and ultimately killing them. He further indicated that prison authorities would not allow him to seek medical treatment for his illness. Saharkhiz, a well-known press activist and former managing editor of the monthly <em>Aftab</em>, was <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-court-sentences-outspoken-editor.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in July 2006 by an Iranian court to four years in prison for publishing articles against the constitution and offending the state media. He was later arrested in 2009 for insulting Iran's government and spreading propaganda following the controversial June 2009 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive]. He is serving three years for that arrest, followed by a five-year ban on political and journalistic activities, and a one-year order to remain in Iran following release.

<p>Iran's prison system has been heavily criticized in recent years. The Iranian government <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/iran-prison-officials-executed-over-protester-deaths.php">executed two men</a> in February <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/iran-court-sentences-2-to-death-over-detained-protester-killings.php">convicted of killing</a> [JURIST reports] three anti-government protesters in prison in 2009, according to a report by pro-government website Khabarnameh Daneshjooyan. The men were charged with torturing and eventually killing Mohammad Kamrani, Amir Javadi-far and Mohsen Ruholamini while they were detained at Kahrizak jail south of Iran. Observers had accused the Iranian government of conducting the <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iran-court-begins-trial-of-prison.php">highly controversial trial</a> [JURIST report] as a mere political move. The Iranian government was also sharply criticized by both pro-democracy leaders and government supporters for the death of the protesters, who were incarcerated after the June 2009 disputed presidential election. Authorities initially claimed that the three detainees had died from meningitis, holding that the torture accusations were propaganda of the opposition party. This viewpoint began to shift in August when <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/iran-official-acknowledges-torture-of.php">government officials spoke out</a> [JURIST report] against the abuse of protesters detained in Iranian prisons and Supreme Leader <a href="http://www.leader.ir/langs/en/">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> [official website] ordered the closure of Kahrizak prison as a result. In January, the <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/">International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a> [official website] claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/">International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a> [advocacy websites] also <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/09/21/iran-appoint-special-un-envoy-investigate-rights-crisis">called for</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate.php">report</a>] the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] to appoint a special envoy to investigate allegations of human rights abuses following the 2009 presidential elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The officers, along with five others, were charged and <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1389689-vesubio-perpetua-para-dos-militares">convicted of various crimes</a> [<em>La Nacion</em> report, in Spanish] including murder, kidnapping and torture that took place at <a href="http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/conadep/nuncamas/176.html">El Vesubio</a> [<em>Nunca Mas</em> backgrounder, in Spanish], a notorious prison operated by the country's former dictatorship. Argentina's military junta controlled the prison from 1976-83 throughout the dictatorship's <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/argentina.htm">"Dirty War"</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Argentina+dirty+war">news archive</a>], during which over 13,000 people were killed. The seven men were charged in February with a total of 156 crimes against humanity. Col. Pedro Alberto Duran, the prison's supervisor who died during the trial, also allegedly raped female prisoners regularly and was charged with 14 counts of homicide, among other accusations. Gen. Hector Gamen and Col. Hugo Pascarelli were given life sentences, while the others were sentenced to 18-22 years in prison.

<p>A number of investigations have been initiated and cases brought to trial as a result of a 2005 Argentina <a href="http://www.csjn.gov.ar/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruling that <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2005/06/14/argentina-amnesty-laws-struck-down">denied amnesty to military figures</a> [HRW report] who committed crimes during the military dictatorship. An Argentine federal court in April <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/argentina-ex-general-sentenced-to-life-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former general Eduardo Cabanillas to life in prison for his involvement in the Dirty War. Former general Luciano Benjamin Menendez, already serving a life sentence, was sentenced to an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/argentina-court-gives-ex-general-additional-life-sentence-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">additional life sentence</a> [JURIST report] in March for the attack and murder of five urban guerrilla group members. Also in March, an Argentine court commenced the trial of former dictators <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/index.php?id=801&amp;L=5&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=jorge-rafael_videla_151&amp;cHash=0bcbee03a1">Jorge Videla</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jorge+Videla">news archive</a>] and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Reynaldo+Bignone">Reynaldo Bignone</a> [JURIST news archive] for allegedly overseeing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/argentina-court-begins-trial-over-dirty-war-baby-thefts.php">systematic plan to steal babies</a> [JURIST report] born to political prisoners.

The government filed the "emergency motion," arguing that a Ninth Circuit panel's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-immediate-end-to-enforcement-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">lift a stay</a> [JURIST report] blocking a lower court injunction against DADT and allowing for an immediate end to enforcement of the controversial policy was misguided. The motion asserts that Congress has already established a plan to repeal DADT, though it currently remains in effect. The appeals court on Monday <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-obama-administration-to-say-if-it-will-defend-don't-ask-don't-tell.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration to say whether it plans to defend DADT, suggesting that it appeared from the merit briefs in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000492">Log Cabin Republicans v. USA</a> [case materials] that the government was not prepared to defend the law's constitutionality because it has asserted only that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [text and materials] is constitutional. Included in the government's filings was a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DADT-DOJ-letter-to-9th-CA-7-14-11.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] from US attorney Henry Whitaker responding to questions presented in the appeal court's July 11 order, namely, whether the Obama administration intended to defend DADT's constitutionality. Whitaker explained that the administration "has fully defended, and continues to defend, the constitutionality" of DADT "as it exists following the enactment of" the Repeal Act:<blockquote>[B]efore enactment of the Repeal Act, the question this case presented ... was whether 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654 was constitutional as originally enacted. But that is no longer the question in this case, in which the plaintiff seeks only prospective relief. The government has not addressed the question the district court decided because the statute the district court considered has been changed, fundamentally altering the legal lens through which a Court must evaluate the constitutionality of the statute. Rather, the government has addressed the only question as to which there is any live controversy remaining: whether the statute as it presently exists is constitutional.</blockquote> The government also filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DADT-Hummer-declaration-7-14-11.pdf">declaration</a> [text, PDF] from top Pentagon official Major General Steven Hummer, arguing that the military, not the courts, should carry out the law's repeal pursuant to the DADT Repeal Act. 

<p>In November, the government requested and received the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stay</a> [JURIST report] that suspended enforcement of the injunction. The government had requested that the appeal be placed on hold in light of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, arguing that moving forward with the appeal would interfere with the repeal schedule that the Act sets in place. After hearing seven months of arguments and briefs, the Ninth Circuit rejected that appeal and lifted the stay. That decision came after the Ninth Circuit's <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-declines-to-put-dont-ask-dont-tell-appeal-on-hold.php">denial</a> [JURIST report] of a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/01/03/10-56813_Abeyance.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] by the US government that the court suspend the government's appeal of an <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-orders-military-to-suspend-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] issued by the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of the Central District of California</a> [official website] requiring the US military to end enforcement of DADT. Congress recently tried to delay the repeal of DADT when it passed the $690 billion <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.1540:">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> [HR 1540 materials], which contains a <a target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c112:2:./temp/~c112LPD2Kg:e286772:">provision</a> [&#167; 533] requiring the chiefs of the branches of the military to submit written certification that DADT's repeal will not be harmful. The Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved in the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billsummary.aspx?bill=HB213&amp;year=2011&amp;code=R">measure</a> [HB 213 materials] imposes penalties on doctors who fail to comply with the new restrictions. It would provide some exceptions, permitting abortions of viable fetuses only when the woman's life is endangered by a physical illness or disability, or when continued pregnancy poses the risk of substantial physical impairment to the pregnant woman. The legislation further requires a concurring opinion from a second physician before the abortion of a viable fetus can be performed. Doctors who abort viable fetuses in violation of the late-term abortion law could face up to seven years in prison and fines between $10,000 and $50,000. Nixon acknowledged the lawmakers' decision while pointing out alternatives to abortion legislation:<blockquote>This legislation was approved by an overwhelming, bi-partisan majority in both houses. Although people have differing views on this issue, it's important that we work together to provide accurate health information, promote personal responsibility, protect women's health, and improve foster care, adoption and child protection services.</blockquote> Despite the governor's not signing the bill, the law will take effect pursuant to <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/const/a03031.htm">Article III, &#167; 31 of the Missouri Constitution</a> [text]. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/">Missouri House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">gave final approval</a> to the legislation in May, and the Senate approved the measure in April after receiving <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST reports] from the House in March. Missouri is just the latest of several states to impose restrictions abortions after the 20-week mark, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain. <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports] have each passed legislation this year which restricts the abortion procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports] have also recently passed legislation restricting late-term abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

FINMA issued the order in February 2009 after the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) accused UBS of assisting Americans in hiding accounts from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official websites]. The Supreme Court found that FINMA acted lawfully, overturning a January 2010 lower court ruling that had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/switzerland-court-rules-ubs-disclosure.php">found FINMA in violation of the law</a> [JURIST report]. FINMA welcomed Friday's ruling and said they would <a href="http://www.finma.ch/d/aktuell/Seiten/mm-bg-urteil-20110715.aspx">carefully review</a> [press release, in German] the court's judgment. The judgment will be available on the court's website once it has been redacted.

<p>The ruling comes as the US seeks to put an end to tax-evasion through the use of overseas accounts. Last July, the Swiss <a href="http://www.bundesverwaltungsgericht.ch/">Federal Administrative Court</a> [official website, in German] ruled that an <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/us-swiss-agreement.pdf">agreement</a> [text, PDF] with the US, allowing UBS to disclose client account information, is <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/switzerland-court-approves-transfer-of-ubs-client-data-to-us.php">binding</a> [JURIST report]. In November 2009, the DOJ and IRS announced that more than 14,700 Americans had <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/doj-lauds-success-of-irs-amnesty-for.php">reported to the IRS</a> [JURIST report] previously hidden overseas bank accounts in response to a <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=206012,00.html">temporary forgiveness program</a> [official website] allowing delinquent taxpayers to avoid criminal prosecution for tax evasion by paying all overdue taxes and penalties. In September of that year, the US and Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/us-switzerland-sign-treaty-on-sharing.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST report] that would increase the amount of information shared between the two nations on would-be tax evaders. The agreement, constructed in accordance with Article 26 of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/57/42219418.pdf">Model Tax Convention</a> [text, PDF], came one month after a Swiss banker and lawyer were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/swiss-banker-lawyer-charged-with.php">indicted in US federal court</a> [JURIST report] for helping clients hide assets. Earlier in 2009, the US reached a preliminary agreement with Switzerland over the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-reaches-deal-with-switzerland-over.php">identification of anonymous accounts</a> [JURIST report] in Swiss banks, which would aid US officials in identifying those who seek to evade taxes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontborder.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Rates of violent crime along the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/systems/mexico-wall.htm">US-Mexico border</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] have been declining for several years, according to a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-07-15-border-violence-main_n.htm?csp=breakingnews">USA Today analysis</a> [text; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011/07/us-mexico-border-violence/49399232/1">interactive materials</a>] released Thursday. The study indicated that, on average, US border cities were safer than other cities in the same states, with border cities maintaining lower crimes rates than the national average. Federal crime statistics, interviews and crime data from over 1,600 local law enforcement agencies in four border states, as well as demographic figures from the US Census Bureau's <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/">American Community Survey</a> [official website], form the basis of the study. The analysis suggests that the US-Mexico border may not be as dangerous as the general US population perceives. For example, according to the study, murder and robbery rates for cities within 50 miles of the border were lower than the respective state average in nearly every year from 1998 to 2009. Critics of the study are concerned that the analysis does not accurately reflect the true landscape of violent crime in border cities and fails to take into consideration those crimes that go unreported, particularly kidnapping and extortion. Several analysts quoted in the report, however, argue that the analysis confirms that politicians have exaggerated the extent to which violence occurs along the US-Mexico border and make unsubstantiated claims linking illegal immigration to crime rates.

<p>The US has adopted numerous approaches to curb illegal immigration and crime along the US-Mexico border.

The FBI said that it had <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/07/2011714232057217914.html">begun to examine the allegations</a> [Al Jazeera report] against News Corp., an organization owned by media mogul <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/rupert-murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a> [<em>Forbes</em> profile].

<p>Members of the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> and <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official websites] called on US agencies Wednesday to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/us-lawmakers-urge-probe-of-news-corp-911-hacking-claim.php">open the News Corp. investigation</a> [JURIST report].

The appeals court held that the use of <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/ait/index.shtm">full body scanners</a> [TSA backgrounder], also known as Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT), does not violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] protection against unreasonable searches, nor does it violate any federal statutes. However, the court said that the TSA violated procedural requirements by failing to give notice to the public as well as provide an opportunity to file comments with the agency pursuant to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sup_01_5_10_I_30_5.html">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) [materials]. Though the petitioners, <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [official website], were <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110715-710231.html">disappointed</a> [WSJ report] that the court dismissed the constitutional challenge, President of EPIC Marc Rotenberg <a href="http://epic.org/press/Press_Release_EPIC_v_DHS_Ruling_071511.pdf">applauded the ruling</a> [press release]:<blockquote>We are pleased with the court's decision. The TSA is now subject to the same rules as other government agencies that help ensure transparency and accountability. Many Americans object to the airport body scanner program. Now they will have an opportunity to express their views to the TSA and the agency must take their views into account as a matter of law.</blockquote> The court ultimately remanded the case to the agency for further proceedings to "cure the defect."

<p>The TSA has come under fire recently for implementing invasive airport security measures. In June, the Texas legislature <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/texas-legislature-passes-tsa-anti-groping-law.php">approved a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that criminalize enhanced airport security pat-downs if they involve touching a passenger's "private" areas. The TSA, however, <a href="http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2011/06/tsa-changes-policy-on-child-pat-downs-/175407/1?csp=34travel&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TP-TodayInTheSky+%28Travel+-+Today+In+the+Sky%29">announced a policy change</a> [USA Today report] earlier that month that seeks to reduce the number of invasive pat-downs of children under age 12. Texas Governor Rick Perry <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/16323/">commended the TSA</a> [press release] for making the change, indicating that "Texas will continue seeking more common-sense approaches to TSA security measures." In April 2010, a group of more than 30 privacy and civil liberty groups asked the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/civil-rights-groups-seek-suspension-of.php">suspend the full body scanner program</a> [JURIST report]. The body scanners were introduced in part as a response to the failed US bombing attempt by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6896128/Detroit-terror-attack-profile-of-Umar-Farouk-Abdul-Mutallab.html">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">news archive</a>] on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day. The attempted attack prompted Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-announces-enhanced-air-security.php">announce tighter security measures</a>, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">civil rights groups opposed</a> [JURIST reports] as a pretext to racial profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abortions in Russia are free at any licensed medical clinic, and the only restrictions on the practice since the end of the Soviet Union ended have applied to late term pregnancies, which are restricted to those performed for the sake of the mother's health or fetal abnormalities. Under the new law, clinics <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/07/16/russia_adopts_law_meant_to_clamp_down_on_abortion/">must allocate at least ten percent</a> [NYT report], of their advertising to health warnings. Also, it is now illegal to promote abortion as a safe procedure. The goal of the law is to protect women's health, decrease the number of deaths that occur with the practice, and to mitigate the drop in population that Russia has experienced, as the UN has found Russia to have the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/07/15/MN3F1KB1KJ.DTL">highest abortion rate in the world</a> [AP report]. Russia has faced recent political divide over the practice as the <a href="http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/english/">Russian Orthodox Church</a> [official website] has made efforts to <a href="http://www.pcusa.org/news/2011/7/7/abortion-fight-taken-russian-orthodox-and-american/">restrict abortion</a> [press release]. The parliament is expected to take up more legislation dealing with abortion in the fall.

<p>Abortion still remains a hotly debated issue in Europe. In May, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ruled that a Polish woman who had been denied genetic testing and an abortion was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/europe-rights-court-rules-against-poland-in-abortion-case.php">subjected to "inhuman treatment"</a> [JURIST report] violating the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. Last year, the court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">Ireland failed to provide</a> [JURIST report] "effective and accessible procedures" to allow Lithuanian women to assert constitutional rights to a lawful abortion. The ruling followed after several women filed suits asserting a violation of their rights to have to travel abroad for abortions. In March 2010, thousands protested in Spain against a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/thousands-protest-spain-abortion-law.php">bill that would allow abortions</a> [JURIST report] up until 14 weeks of pregnancy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order follows a motion made by the Obama administration on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-administration-asks-appeals-court-to-reinstate-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">asking the court to reinstate DADT</a> [JURIST report], which bars gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. The government filed an emergency motion arguing that the Ninth Circuit panel's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-immediate-end-to-enforcement-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">order a halt to the policy</a> [JURIST report] was misguided and would hinder the repeal process underway. In the ruling, the court agreed that the new revisions might hinder the repeal process:<blockquote>In the motion for reconsideration, appellants provide considerably more detailed information concerning the implementation of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 than they did in their May 20, 2011, opposition to the motion to lift the stay. ... Appellants acknowledge that they did not previously inform the court of the full extent of the implementation of the Repeal Act. In order to provide this court with an opportunity to consider fully the issues presented in light of these previously undisclosed facts, the stay ... is reinstated temporarily.</blockquote>Although the DADT policy will be reinstated, the court made explicit demands that the military may not investigate, penalize or discharge anyone from the military as the original 1993 provisions of the policy allowed. Appellants have until July 18 to explain why they did not include the same detailed information in their first motion as they did in their reconsideration motion to lift the stay. 

<p>In November, the court issued the original <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stay</a> [JURIST report] suspending enforcement of the injunction against DADT. The government had requested that the litigation be placed on hold in light of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">passage of an act to repeal the policy</a> [JURIST report], arguing that moving forward with the appeal would interfere with the repeal schedule. After hearing seven months of arguments and briefs, the Ninth Circuit rejected that appeal and lifted the stay. Congress recently tried to delay the repeal of DADT when it passed the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.1540:">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> [HR 1540 materials], which contains a provision requiring the chiefs of the branches of the military to submit written certification that the DADT repeal will not be harmful. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The five men, who have been detained since April, were charged in June under &#167; 176 of the UAE <a href="http://www.dubailaw.com/article/viewarticle.asp?id=87">Penal Code</a> [text] for publicly insulting UAE president Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed and other government officials. Two of the five men are alleged to have used or incited violence on <a href="http://www.uaehewar.net/Forums/">UAE Hewar</a> [official website, in Arabic], an online political forum. Blogger Ahmed Mansoor, one of the five, was also charged with inciting others to break the law, demonstrating and calling for an election boycott. The rights groups contend that the UAE government has failed to provide sufficient evidence to convict the activists. HRW Middle East Director Sarah Leah Whitson expressed disapproval for how the UAE and international community have handled the prosecution:<blockquote>In this day and age, with all that is going on in the region, it is disturbing and absurd that the UAE is prosecuting activists simply because they spoke out for democracy. The international community should end its silence and condemn this mockery of justice; the government had no business arresting these men in the first place.</blockquote>The trial is scheduled to reconvene on Monday before Abu Dhabi's Supreme Court. If convicted, the activists face up to five years in prison. 

<p>Rights groups have criticized the UAE recently for its conduct in the wake of calls for political reform. HRW <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/22/uae-government-dissolves-rights-group-s-board">urged</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-uae-to-reverse-decision-to-dissolve-civil-rights-group.php">report</a>] the government of the UAE in April to reverse its decision to dissolve the board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights group. HRW was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/09/uae-government-detains-human-rights-defender">critical of the UAE government</a> [press release] when it arrested Mansoor in April for calling for democratic reform. HRW also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/uae-foreign-institutions-should-condemn-crackdown">urged international public institutions</a> [HRW press release] that have a presence in the country, such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a> (NYU), and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.agencefrancemuseums.fr/en/home/">Agence France Museum</a> [official websites], to publicly condemn the UAE government's detention of rights activists. HRW has continued to monitor the UAE's compliance with international human rights standards following a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/united-arab-emirates">2010 report</a> [HRW report] suggesting the human rights climate in the UAE has worsened. HRW has been particularly concerned about torture, the deterioration of conditions for migrant workers, restrictions on freedoms of expression and association, and violations of women's rights.

Gulf residents and businesses <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bp-facing-fraud-lawsuits-over-oil-spill.php">filed lawsuits in June 2010</a> [JURIST report] alleging violations of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [18 USC &#167; 1961 et seq.] statute, claiming that BP purposefully defrauded the American public in order to increase company profits. The first lawsuit, a class action filed on behalf of US residents affected by the oil spill, contends that BP engaged in a scheme to secure profits by deceiving the public. The second suit alleges that BP has been involved in racketeering and corruption related to the BP claims payment process. According to the complaint, BP has been involved in corruption, wire fraud, mail fraud, unauthorized practice of law, violation of state insurances laws and regulations and other criminal activity in order to delay or reduce the payment of legitimate claims for damages. The court granted BP's motion to dismiss the RICO claims on the grounds that the causal connection between BP's alleged fraud and the plaintiffs' injuries was too attenuated to constitute a RICO violation. The same court on Friday also <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/OilSpill/Orders/7152011Order%28MotiontoStay%29.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] BP's motion to stay a claim filed by Andarko, a BP partner, because its contract with BP required arbitration for such legal disputes rather than litigation.

<p>Calls for criminal and civil actions have been mounting against BP, as evidence of the oil giant's lack of proper compliance with regulations has come out. In February, Mississippi <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us/">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] asked the district court to order the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/index">Gulf Coast Claims Facility</a> (GCCF) [official website] to fulfill its legal obligations to aid victims of the spill and to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/mississippi-ag-seeks-to-remedy-deficiencies-of-bp-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">remedy inadequate claims mechanisms</a> [JURIST report]. The GCCF <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/independent-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund-begins-processing-claims.php">began processing claims</a> in August following the completion of <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">negotiations</a> [JURIST reports] between BP and the US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website]. Former Alabama Attorney General Troy King <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/alabama-ag-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August against BP for damages to the state's coast and economy, claiming that the oil giant has failed in its efforts to accept responsibility for the oil spill. In July, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bp-facing-lawsuit-over-handling-of-oil-spill-cleanup.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed against the company in a Louisiana state court alleging that its negligent actions led to the spill and that BP was further negligent in its oversight of the cleanup effort, resulting in volunteers falling ill due to inadequate protective equipment. In June 2010, US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] is reviewing whether any criminal or civil <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-to-initiate-criminal-probe-of-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">laws were violated</a> [JURIST report] by BP resulting in the oil spill.  Holder cited several statutes being examined by government lawyers including the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/lcwa.html">Clean Water Act</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm">Oil Pollution Act of 1990</a> [materials]. In May 2010, DC-based consumer advocacy organization <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/">Food and Water Watch</a> (FWW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-lawsuit-seeks-to-stop-drilling-at-bp-gulf-%20platform.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in a US district court against the US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of Interior</a> (DOI) and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mms.gov/">Minerals Management Service</a> (MMS) [official websites] for an injunction to halt drilling at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&amp;contentId=7052055">BP Atlantis Facility</a> [corporate website], another BP Gulf of Mexico site.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Robert Bryan ruled that, given the diminished potential for <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements typically feared in electoral campaigns, the state failed to demonstrate sufficient grounds on which to extend to recall efforts its otherwise legitimate interest in preventing corruption or the appearance thereof. As such, Bryan found that the state's law <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.17.640">capping contributions to recall campaigns at &#36;800</a> [RCW &#167; 42.17.640(3) text] inappropriately curbs individuals' First Amendment rights to campaign speech. The case stems from an effort to recall Pierce County Assessor-Treasurer <a href="http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/pc/abtus/ourorg/at/at.htm">Dale Washam</a> [official website], which will proceed without being subject to the contribution limit until a <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Judge-blocks-Wash-limit-on-recall-contributions-1468108.php">full hearing on its constitutionality</a> [AP report] can be held.

<p>In March 2010, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf//content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that limiting contributions from individuals to independent political advocacy organizations is unconstitutional. The court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">eased restrictions</a> [JURIST report] on political and campaign spending by corporations on First Amendment grounds. <u>Citizens United</u> overturned Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (BCRA) [text, PDF], which prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make independent expenditures for speech defined as an "electioneering communication" or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HTC will <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-15/apple-wins-trade-agency-ruling-that-htc-infringes-2-patents.html">appeal</a> [Bloomberg report] the ruling. If the ruling stands, the United States will likely block several HTC phones that carry Android, which is <a href = "http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/">Google's</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GOOG:US">backgrounder</a>] representative in the smartphone market and the most popular smartphone OS in the US. Regardless of whether the appeal goes in favor of HTC, general counsel Grace Lei <a href = "http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2011/07/17/trade_panel_says_htc_infringed_on_2_apple_patents/">said they have alternate tools and methods</a> [Bloomberg report] to circumvent the patent infringement. Some have theorized this will involve paying a <a href = "http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2011/07/17/2003508401">licensing fee</a> [<em>Taipei</em> report] or settling with Apple, thus raising the prices of Android-based phones.

<p>This is the second suit that Apple has brought against HTC. Last year, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/apple-files-patent-infringement-suit.php">filed suits</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> and with the USITC alleging patent infringements. HTC later also <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/htc-files-patent-infringement-complaint-against-apple.php">filed a suit</a> [JURIST report] against Apple for infringement related to portable electronic devices. Apple's claim comes days after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-samsung.php">filed a complaint against Samsung</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to bar importation of Samsung's smartphones and tablets. Apple claimed Samsung's "Galaxy" line copies its iPhone and iPad technology. That complaint came just a week after <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/samsung-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-apple.php">Samsung filed a similar complaint</a> [JURIST report] seeking to prevent Apple from importing iPads and iPhones. Samsung claimed that Apple violated five patents also related to smartphones and tablets. In addition, Samsung <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-30/samsung-sues-apple-in-london-following-u-s-iphone-ipad-patent-lawsuit.html"</a>filed a patent infringement suit</a> [Bloomberg report] against Apple in the High Court in London two weeks ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Citing continued discrimination of Kurds, Clinton asked that Turkey expand religious freedoms. Further, she denounced a proposal set to go into effect in August that would allow Turkish authorities to monitor citizen's usage of the Internet. All of the comments were made during an interview with CNN Turkey during Clinton's recent diplomatic visit to Turkey, Greece and India.

<p>Clinton said she believed these backslides in human rights is "inconsistent" with Turkey's growing emergence in the international community. She also praised Turkey's improving record on LGBT rights, in their effort to gain <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/index_en.htm">accession to the European Union</a> (EU) [EU country profile], and congratulated them on their recent successful election.</p>

<p>Last month, Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pMain.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official website, in Turkish] pledged to work with opposition leaders to <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/turkish-pm-promises-creation-of-constitution-by-consensus.php">build the country's new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Some groups have chastised Erdogan for failing to carry out his promises to ease tension between the Kurdish minority and the government, reform the judiciary and reduce unemployment. He has, however, been praised for his governance of the Turkish economy, which has experienced growth in recent years. Constitutional reforms are an issue for Turkey's accession to the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] since its constitution was written under military rule and limits freedom of expression and religion. A council for the EU in May 2009 said that <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/er/107933.pdf">Turkey should do more</a> [press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/turkish-government-urged-to-make.php">report</a>] in terms of judicial reform, protection of citizens' rights and various other efforts in order to further their request to be granted <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/enlargement_process/accession_process/criteria/index_en.htm">accession to the EU</a> [criteria materials]. In <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/europe-rights-court-rules-turkish.php">2009</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2010/09/europe-rights-court-rules-turkey-failed-to-protect-murdered-journalist-1.php">2010</a> [JURIST reports], the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ruled against Turkey in journalism-related rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thirty-five people were killed by Hungarian forces under Kepiro's control during the World War II raid. Kepiro, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-nazi-goes-on-trial-in-hungary.php">whose trial began in May</a> [JURIST report], persistently denied involvement and <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/07/18/international/i030432D43.DTL#ixzz1SScjczlk">rejected the charges</a> [AP report].

Kepiro was convicted both in 1944 and 1946 and sentenced to 10 years for involvement in the raids, but he was released and fled to Argentina. He was located and apprehended by the SWC in 2006 and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hungary-prosecutors-charge-top-nazi-suspect-with-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in February.

An <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/german-prosecutors-vow-to-appeal-demjanjuk-release.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] of his release is pending. In November, Nazi guard <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profile.html?tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=samuel_kunz_936">Samuel Kunz</a> [Trial Watch profile], 89, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/former-nazi-prison-guard-dies-while-awaiting-trial.php">passed away</a> [JURIST report] in his home before he could be brought to trial.

The ICJ ruling stems from a request from Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/cambodia-asks-icj-to-review-disputed-temple-on-thailand-border.php">seeking clarification</a> [JURIST report] from the court of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/45/4871.pdf">1962 decision</a> [judgment, PDF] awarding the temple to the Cambodian city of Phnom Penh.

The Tribunal of Ministers would require parliamentary authorization before hearing the case against Berlusconi. Berlusconi is on trial for allegedly paying for sex with a minor, then 17-year-old dancer, Karima El Mahroug, known as Ruby, and later calling police to secure her release while she was detained on an unrelated suspicion of theft. Also on Monday, a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/18/italy.berlusconi.cases/">hearing</a> [CNN report] was held in a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/italy-court-again-postpones-berlusconi.php">separate corruption case</a> [JURIST report] against Berlusconi for allegedly paying his former lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=David+Mills">David Mills</a> [JURIST news archive] in order to secure false testimony in his favor during two trials in 1997 and 1998 involving Berlusconi's broadcasting company, <a href="http://www.gruppomediaset.it">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian]. The judge <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/berlusconi-loses-bid-to-move-under-age-prostitution-trial-from-milan/2011/07/18/gIQAgcePLI_story.html">denied several other motions</a> [AP report] brought by Berlusconi's lawyers. He did not attend the hearing, and his case was continued until October 3. 

<p>Berlusconi has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases, including two other ongoing proceedings involving <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-appears-in-court-calls-tax-fraud-hearing-a-waste-of-time.php">tax fraud</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this month, an Italian appeals court ordered <a href="http://www.fininvest.it/en/holding/profile">Fininvest</a> [corporate website], a holding company owned by Berlusconi, to pay 560 million euros (USD 801 million) in damages and fees to <a href="http://www.cirgroup.com/">Compagnie Industriali Riunite</a> (CIR) Group [corporate website]. The complaint stemmed from Fininvest's 1991 acquisition of Italian publishing company <a href="http://www.mondadori.com/">Mondadori</a> [corporate website], during which Fininvest bribed a judge in exchange for favorable decisions. Neither Berlusconi nor Ruby <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-trial-for-prostitution-and-abuse-of-power-charges-ajourns-after-10-minutes.php">attended</a> [JURIST report] the beginning of the prostitution trial in April, and the court adjourned after only 10 minutes. Both parties deny having a sexual relationship, and Berlusconi has denied any wrongdoing, calling the accusations groundless. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttobacco.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.sfcityattorney.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=846">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lawsuit over the constitutional right to sell cigarettes. The lawsuit was brought by <a href="http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/Investors#iframetop">Safeway, Inc.</a> [corporate website], a chain of grocery stores, challenging a San Francisco city ordinance banning the sale of cigarettes by pharmacies. The original ordinance had included an exception for "big-box stores" that contain pharmacies, but it was amended due to a lawsuit brought by Walgreens arguing that such an exception violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> (EPC) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The ordinance cites health risks associated with smoking cigarettes and states, "through the sale of tobacco products, pharmacies convey tacit approval of the purchase and use of tobacco products, which sends a mixed message to consumers who generally patronize pharmacies for health care services." Safeway argued that the ordinance did not apply to its stores because the pharmacies are separate and isolated from the counters selling cigarettes, and the pharmacy personnel are not asked to sell cigarettes. Safeway further argued that the city's revocation of licenses to sell cigarettes granted under the exception in the original ordinance violated due process. Judge Claudia Wilken, however, said that the ordinance was a valid use of the police power and did not violate the EPC: <blockquote>The purpose of the amended ordinance, to promote the public health by preventing people from becoming addicted to tobacco and by helping those already addicted to stop smoking, is legitimate and even compelling. In prohibiting the sale of tobacco products in pharmacies, the amended ordinance accomplishes its purpose by ending any inference that tobacco products may not be harmful because they are sold by a major participant in the health care delivery system.</blockquote> Furthermore, the court held that the ordinance was not preempted by state law regulating pharmacists. The court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice and without leave to amend. San Francisco <a href="http://www.sfcityattorney.org/index.aspx?page=13">City Attorney David Herrera</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.sfcityattorney.org/index.aspx?page=372">said</a> [press release], "those who operate pharmacies have chosen to participate in our healthcare delivery system, and that should not include the delivery of cigarettes. I am grateful that Judge Wilken rejected the argument that Safeway &#8212; whose slogan is 'Ingredients for Life' &#8212; has a constitutional right to sell addictive tobacco products." The <a href="http://www.cmanet.org/">California Medical Association</a> [official website] filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief in favor of San Francisco.

<p>Cigarettes and other tobacco products have been subject to strict marketing regulations on both the federal and state levels. Earlier this year, two tobacco companies <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tobacco-companies-file-lawsuit-against-fda-advisory-panel.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] against the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] to enjoin a recent opinion by the agency's advisory committee due to conflicts of interest. Last year, the FDA announced a final <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/FDA-1995-N-0259-0002.htm">rule</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fda-announces-final-rule-restricting.php">restricting tobacco sales and promotions</a> [JURIST report] directed at youth. The Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents are a set of broad regulations "designed to significantly curb access to and the appeal of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to children and adolescents in the United States." In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking and Tobacco Prevention Act</a> [HR 1256 text], which grants the FDA certain authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients. The bill gives the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products but does not permit the agency to regulate tobacco leaf that is not in the hands of tobacco product manufacturers or producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco growers, tobacco warehouses and tobacco grower cooperatives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Police <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14178051">arrested Brooks</a> [BBC report] on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and on suspicion of corruption. She was questioned and released on bail hours later. NI is a subsidiary of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newscorp.com/">News Corporation</a> (News Corp.)

In a 54-page <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/bahrain0711webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "Targets of Retribution: Attacks against Medics, Injured Protesters, and Health Facilities," HRW presents evidence that Bahraini authorities have attacked health care providers, denied medical access to protesters injured by security forces, seized hospitals and health centers, and detained, mistreated, tortured and prosecuted medical professionals and patients. Documentation of the abuses began on February 17, when protestors and bystanders were attacked by government security forces during what HRW described as largely peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations. The invasion and capture of medical facilities has left injured protestors without necessary medical attention and exacerbated their conditions, HRW reported. Joe Stork, Deputy Middle East Director at HRW, contends that the systematic attacks are unfounded and constitute efforts to exact revenge on protestors:<blockquote>The attacks on medics and wounded protesters have been part of an official policy of retribution against Bahrainis who supported pro-democracy protests. Medical personnel who criticized the severe repression were singled out and jailed, among the more than 1,600 Bahrainis facing solitary confinement and ill-treatment in detention and unfair trials before a special military court. Officials justify the government's crackdown and the arrests of the medics by alleging that they violated the principle of medical neutrality and committed heinous crimes. Yet they have failed to provide any convincing evidence that their actions are anything but a campaign of retribution aimed at silencing government critics.</blockquote> The Bahraini government alleges that actions by protesters and medical staff compelled security and military forces to intervene. According to the report, over 30 people have died during the protest aftermath.

<p>A Bahrain court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-doctors-nurses-on-trial-for-treating-injured-protesters.php">arraigned 47 doctors and nurses</a> [JURIST report] in June on charges of trying to overthrow the government and participating in illegal demonstrations when they helped treat injured protesters at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.moh.gov.bh/EN/HealthEstablishment/SMC.aspx">Salmaniya Medical Complex</a> [official website], a state-run center in Bahrain's capital, Manama.

Vlasenko had been defending Tymoshenko in a criminal case related to United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by the former prime minister. The Pechersky District Court of Kiev <a href="http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/74202/">dismissed Vlasenko</a> [<em>Interfax</em> report] saying he was responsible for systematic violation of order in the court, in contempt of court and responsible for obstruction of justice with disregard for the rule of law. Tymoshenko said on her website that the dismissal is an <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/9vz5mcu7">attempt to deprive her of effective counsel</a> [press release] and criticized that the proceedings are being held behind closed doors. Vlasenko said he will <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/108859/print/">appeal the dismissal</a> [<em>Kyiv Post</em> report]. Tymoshenko's <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-goes-on-trial-for-abuse-of-power.php">ongoing trial</a> includes charges of <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ukraine-ex-prime-minister-charged-with-abuse-of-office.php">abuse of office</a> in connection with signing gas import contracts with Russia, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ukraine-prosecutors-charge-ex-pm-tymoshenko-with-misusing-state-funds.php">misappropriating state funds</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ukraine-prosecutors-launch-new-investigation-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">abuse of authority</a> [JURIST reports] by purchasing "1000 Opel Combo" medical vans at a 20 percent mark-up during her time as prime minister from 2007-2010. UESU allegedly embezzled USD $405 million from the government.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are  <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into UESU. Last month, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], alleging violations of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a target="_blank" href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. ECHR President Jean Paul Costa <a target="_blank" href="http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/1235011-v-espch-ne-kommentiruyut-perspektivu-iskov-timoshenko-k-ukraine">refused to comment on the complaint</a> [Korrespondent report, in Russian], but said the matter was before the court. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He also reported that UN staffers have been abducted, injured and killed during their efforts to investigate the human rights abuses.

<p>UN <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon</a> [official websites] also voiced concern about the violence in South Sudan, called for a cease-fire and emphasized the UN's need for "unfettered access" to the area. The UN was unable to monitor the conditions in some regions of Sudan recently because the <a href="http://unmis.unmissions.org/">UN Mission in Sudan</a> (UNMIS) [official website], a peacekeeping mission, does not extend to the Republic of South Sudan, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">became independent on July 9</a> [JURIST report]. The UN will publish an official report on its findings within the next 10 to 14 days.</p>

<p>South Kordofan, which has been held by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) since the 2005 peace deal that stifled Sudan's civil war, is a state in the center of Sudan, and has been a disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan due to its oil reserves. The UN Under-Secretary-General for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/en/humanitarian/">Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] and Emergency Relief Coordinator <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=145">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] <a target="_blank" href="http://reliefweb.int/node/421571">denounced continued human rights abuses</a> [statement] against civilians in the South Kordofan region in June, saying that the UN knows of more than 70,000 people who have been displaced by the conflict, many of whom are subject to violence and targeting due to their ethnic heritage. Sudan's army, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), took over Abyei, a district in the state in May, causing a <a href="paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-peaceful-resolution-of-sudan-conflict.php">rebuke</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-security-council-demands-removal-of-sudan-troops-from-disputed-region.php">demand for withdrawal</a> [JURIST reports] by the UN. The UN confirmed reports of bombing and shelling in and around Abyei by the SAF, as well as widespread looting and burning of houses. Aid workers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13549157">estimate 40,000 people have fled the area</a> [BBC report]. While the UN has said that attacks on its peacekeepers amount to war crimes under international law, both the UN and the US have called on the northern troops to withdraw from Abyei. From the northern capital of Khartoum <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/icc02050109?lan=en-GB">ICC case materials</a>; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bashir">news archive</a>] has stated he will not withdraw troops from the region and insisted that the area belongs to the north.

The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/18/us-pakistan-drone-idUSTRE76H3MG20110718">complaint alleges</a> [Reuters report] that former General Counsel to the CIA John Rizzo approved the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to carry out drone strikes and admitted to doing so in a February <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-killing-machine.html">Newsweek interview</a> [text]. The aerial attacks target <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] and <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/10551/taliban_in_afghanistan.html">Taliban</a> [CFR backgrounder] militants, but civilians are often killed or injured in the collateral damage. The complaint also seeks an international warrant for Rizzo's arrest. 

<p>The Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/state-department-legal-adviser-defends.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] its use of targeted killings, specifically those made by unmanned predator drone strikes. <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/">State Department Legal Adviser</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/faculty/HKoh.htm">Harold Koh</a> [academic profile] has said the drones "comply with all applicable law" because they target only military targets and enable minimal damage to civilians and civilian structures. UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website] noted in October 2009 that the use of unmanned drones by the US to carry out attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-rights-investigator-warns-us-drone.php">may be illegal</a> [JURIST report]. In January 2006, then-Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/472997.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile] contended that the US <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/pakistan-president-says-us-air-strike.php">violated its sovereignty</a> [JURIST report] in an air strike on a village near the Afghanistan border.

Judge James Ware <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/07/18/bloomberg1376-LOJV2R6JTSED01-187ESBGDEMTNBT2B1V2O9KTM9R.DTL">granted</a> [Bloomberg report] Google's request to delay the lawsuit pending an appeal of a ruling against Google. The lawsuit claims that Google is violating wiretapping laws by collecting data for its <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Street View</a> [official website] program using WiFi networks. Ware <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-allows-google-street-view-suit-to-proceed.php">rejected a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the class-action lawsuit against Google in June, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304584004576418563914269314.html">denying</a> [WSJ report] Google's argument that when they collected information while creating their Street View feature, the information was freely and publicly available. Google collected private details transmitted on unencrypted wireless connections, but the company claims it was inadvertent. 

<p>Google has recently faced a number of allegations from the international community related to violating privacy laws by capturing personal data through Google Street View. In April, the <a href="http://www.bvger.ch/">Swiss Federal Administrative Court</a> (FAC) [official website, in German] publicized its ruling that Google Street View <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/switzerland-court-rules-google-street-view-constitutes-breach-of-privacy.php">constitutes a breach of privacy</a> [JURIST report] for the country's citizens and ordered Google to take extra steps to ensure adequate protection. In March, a Berlin high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google's Street View mapping service is legal in Germany. The ruling, which cannot be appealed, was narrowly focused on property rights, ignoring larger data protection issues the company is currently confronting. Also in March, the <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/">French National Commission of Information Technology and Liberty</a> (CNIL) [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-commission-fines-google-for-violating-data-privacy-laws.php">fined Google</a> [JURIST report] 100,000 euros (USD $141,300) for violating French data privacy laws by capturing personal data through Google Street View cars, used for its Google Maps service. Google has admitted to the collection of e-mails, passwords and other data over unsecured WiFi networks, but maintained that it was a mistake and that it did not intend to include the code which captured payload data from unsecured WiFi networks. In response to the controversy, Google grounded its Street View cars. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The law restricts the use of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/postmarketdrugsafetyinformationforpatientsandproviders/ucm111323.htm">mifepristone</a>, <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111315.htm">misoprostol</a> [FDA backgrounders] and other drugs approved by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/default.htm">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] to induce first-trimester abortions. The complaint, filed on behalf of the sole abortion provider in the state, alleges that the law would altogether prohibit medication abortions, preventing women who prefer the non-surgical abortion procedure from obtaining treatment. Moreover, the complaint alleges, the law creates an undue, expensive and unconstitutional burden because women would have to travel long distances to obtain abortions. CRR President and CEO Nancy Northup <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-takes-legal-action-to-block-north-dakota-attack-on-women%E2%80%99s">denounced the law</a> [press release], saying it infringes on women's reproductive rights:<blockquote>North Dakota has enacted a law that defies reason, science, and the expertise of doctors worldwide in an underhanded effort to deny women their legal right to terminate a pregnancy safely, early, and in accordance with their doctors' advice and their own wishes. It is unimaginable that any other medical procedures would be targeted for restrictions aimed at reducing their effectiveness and increasing their expense and inconvenience. This is an assault on women's reproductive rights and health, pure and simple.</blockquote>The plaintiffs also contend that the law is impermissibly vague, constitutes an improper delegation of legislative authority and violates the privileges and immunities and bodily integrity rights of women, among other challenges. CRR is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the legislation, which is scheduled to take effect on August 1. 

<p>North Dakota is one of many states to introduce more restrictive abortion regulations in recent months. In June, the <a href="http://www.house.state.oh.us/">Ohio House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 54-43 to approve <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=129_HB_125">legislation</a> [HB 125] that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ohio-lawmakers-approve-bill-prohibiting-abortion-after-fetal-heartbeat-detection.php">prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable</a> [JURIST report], which could occur as early as six weeks into the pregnancy. The <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] also voted in June in favor of a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy</a> [JURIST report], making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. In May, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] upheld an Ohio <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2919.123">law</a> [2919.123 text] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-upholds-ohio-law-limiting-abortion-pill.php">limits the use of the "abortion pill"</a> [JURIST report], overturning a 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-rules-ohio-anti-abortion.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report]. Oklahoma has also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">prohibited the use of mifepristone</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/philippines0711WebRevised.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "No Justice Just Adds to the Pain: Killings, Disappearances, and Impunity in the Philippines," HRW presents evidence indicating that the Philippine military was involved in seven murders and three disappearances of leftist activists since <a href="http://www.president.gov.ph/default.aspx">President Benigno Aquino III</a> [official website] took office in June 2010. Many of the victims were members of the Communist Party of the Philippines New People's Army (CPP-NPA), a group whose members are typically involved in leftist organizations and oppose military presence in local communities. The killings and abductions allegedly carried out by the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) paramilitary forces often take place with witnesses standing by, the report said. Elaine Pearson, Deputy Asia Director at HRW, condemned the military's behavior and called on the government to hold soldiers accountable:<blockquote>Activists are being gunned down in the street, while implicated soldiers walk free. The Philippines can only bring an end to these horrific abuses if it is clear that anyone who orders or commits them will be jailed and their military careers will be over. The brazen nature of some of these abuses&#8212;in broad daylight and in front of witnesses&#8212;shows how members of the military can kill and 'disappear' people with little regard for the consequences. Tagging someone as a leftist activist is like sounding the alarm that they are on a military hit list.</blockquote>HRW was unable to report on several other alleged military killings because of time constraints.

<p>The Philippines has faced political turmoil in recent years. Aquino signed an <a href="http://www.gov.ph/downloads/Executive-Order-No1.pdf">executive order</a> [text, PDF] in July 2010 to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">set up a "truth commission"</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration of former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">Gloria Macapagal Arroyo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gloria+arroyo">news archive</a>] engaged in corruption and rights violations. Arroyo was elected to the lower house of parliament in April 2010 after <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">receiving permission to run for the seat</a> [JURIST report] despite protests that her presidency gave her an unfair advantage. In March of that year, Aquino and other presidential candidates criticized as "unjust" a Supreme Court ruling that allowed Arroyo to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-supreme-court-rules.php">appoint a replacement for the retiring chief justice</a> [JURIST report], who planned to step down a week after the May presidential elections. Arroyo <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">declared martial law</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009 for the first time in 23 years in the wake of a massacre in the Maguindanao province that left 57 dead. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttencommandments.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A federal judge on Friday <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/pdfs/2011-07-ACLU-DixieJudgement.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] Florida's Dixie County Courthouse to remove the <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/images/Dixie10C-1.jpg">Ten Commandments monument</a> [JPG] displayed on the front steps of the courthouse. The <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> (ACLUFL) [advocacy website] filed the lawsuit in early 2007, arguing that the monument violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the First Amendment to the US Constitution. Dixie County maintained that the display was protected as private speech under the Free Speech Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a> [text] because the monument, which cost over USD $20,000 to construct, weighs six tons and includes a banner proclaiming "Love God and Keep His Commandments," was purchased and installed by a private community member. The court, however, ruled that because of the location, "permanent" nature and religious message of the structure, it must be removed. Judge Maurice Paul agreed with the ACLUFL, concluding that the monument's religious message would be interpreted to be espoused by the government:<blockquote>As noted previously, permanent displays carry the indicia of government speech. This strongly implies endorsement of the message being conveyed. However, beyond the mere permanence of the monument, the context of the display establishes Dixie County's endorsement of its religious message. The monument is five-feet tall, made of six tons of granite, and sits alone at the center of the top of the steps in front of the county courthouse that houses every significant local government office. "No viewer could reasonably think that it occupies this location without the support and approval of the government."</blockquote>Furthermore, the court held that the monument violates the <span class="casename">Lemon</span> test, which states that, "a governmental practice violates the Establishment Clause if it does not have a secular purpose, if its primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion, or if it fosters excessive government entanglement with religion." The monument must be removed from the courthouse steps within 30 days.

<p>The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] in February <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0029p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sixth-circuit-rules-against-ten-commandments-in-ohio-courthouse.php">barring the Ten Commandments</a> [JURIST report] from being displayed in an Ohio courthouse. The Sixth Circuit in June 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sixth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-ten-commandments-in-kentucky-courthouses.php">upheld an injunction against similar displays</a> [JURIST report] in two Kentucky courthouses, finding that the displays represented simply another strategy "in a long line of attempts" to comply with the Constitution for litigation purposes and did not "minimize the residue of religious purpose." A month earlier, the same court denied an <em>en banc</em> rehearing in <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0006p-06.pdf">another case</a> [opinion, PDF] involving the display of the Ten Commandments in a Grayson County, Kentucky, courthouse. The court found the display to be constitutional because it presented a valid secular purpose from the outset. In a 2005 decision, the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/ten-commandments-display-ruling-stirs.php">ruled in favor of a Ten Commandments display</a> [JURIST report] in a Mercer County, Kentucky, courthouse. A 2005 Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rejects.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting an earlier attempt at a similar display in Kentucky prompted lawmakers to <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/lawmakers-propose-amendment-to.php">propose a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] to overturn it. On the same day, the Supreme Court ruled that a <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-high-court-allows.php">six-foot-tall display of the Ten Commandments</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds of the Texas state capitol was constitutionally acceptable because it had a secular purpose.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Carney also said that Obama supports the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced by Congressional Democrats</a> [JURIST report] in February to repeal DOMA, the 1996 federal law that defines marriage as a "a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife." Carney relayed the president's sentiments about repealing DOMA and communicated the president's support for the Respect for Marriage Act:<blockquote>I can tell you that the President has long called for a legislative repeal of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which continues to have a real impact on the lives of real people &#8212; our families, friends and neighbors. He is proud to support the Respect for Marriage Act, introduced by Senator Feinstein and Congressman Nadler, which would take DOMA off the books once and for all. This legislation would uphold the principle that the federal government should not deny gay and lesbian couples the same rights and legal protections as straight couples.</blockquote>The Senate will hold the first hearing for the Respect for Marriage Act today.

<p>In March, House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] announced that he was launching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">legal advisory group to defend</a> [JURIST report] DOMA, stating "[t]he constitutionality of this law should be determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally, and this action by the House will ensure the matter is addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution." Democrats introduced the Respect for Marriage Act following February's announcement by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA, which restricts the federal definition of marriage to heterosexual couples, in court cases challenging the provision. The announcement came just one month after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA. The appeal followed a July 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. Six states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage. Currently DOMA allows other states to ignore those recognized same-sex marriages, and prevents same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits available to married couples. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Serbian President Boris Tadic <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=07&dd=20&nav_id=75535">announced the arrest</a> [B92 report] through a <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foEz-o9MdD4">press conference</a> [summary video; <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lODCM5jtJjo">full video</a>, in Bosnian], stating that Serbia has fulfilled its obligations to The Hague and was not harboring Hadzic at any time. The Special Court in Belgrade <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=07&dd=20&nav_id=75542">deemed Hadzic fit for extradition</a> immediately after the arrest on Wednesday and he could be deported to The Hague <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=07&dd=20&nav_id=75540">within the week</a> [B92 reports]. ICTY prosecutor <a href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile], reacting to the arrest, praised the triumph of international law, but emphasized the need to fully <A href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/10735">prosecute the indicted</a> [press release]:<blockquote>As we pause to reflect on the significance of Hadzic's arrest for the Tribunal, we are mindful that the Tribunal is part of a much broader process for establishing accountability for atrocities committed during the wars in the former Yugoslavia. The victims of thousands of other crimes are still waiting for justice. The prosecution of war crimes in national proceedings remains a critical challenge for the region and its people. The Office of the Prosecutor will continue to use its best efforts to assist the fight against impunity in the former Yugoslavia, by providing national prosecutors with information, evidence and expertise. The international community also has a key role to play in ensuring that national prosecutions can successfully take over the Tribunal's work in establishing accountability for the atrocities committed. With Hadzic's arrest we take solace in the knowledge that the Tribunal can now complete its work. But to ensure full accountability for the atrocities committed during the war in the former Yugoslavia, we must also redouble our commitment to supporting the remaining national prosecutions.</blockquote>Completion of the ICTY is considered the final step before Serbia's accession to the <a href = "http://www.europa.eu">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. Representatives of the EU released a statement <a href = "http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/11/531&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">praising Serbia for the arrest</a> [press release], but noted: "Full cooperation with the ICTY continues to be essential on Serbia's way towards the European Union." Reportedly, full <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-20/serbia-arrests-fugitive-commander-hadzic-in-last-croatia-war-crimes-case.html">recognition of Kosovo</a> [Bloomberg report] also remains a bar for Serbia to reach before accession. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh-Rasmussen also <a href = "http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_76595.htm">welcomed the arrest</a> [press release].

<p>Hadzic was a key player in the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] and has been at large for approximately seven years. Hadzic's <a href = "http://www.icty.org/x/cases/hadzic/cis/en/cis_hadzic_en.pdf">official charges</a> [case information sheet, PDF] are: persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; extermination; murder; torture; inhumane acts; deportation and forcible transfer; cruel treatment; wanton destruction of villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity; destruction or willful damage done to institutions dedicated to education and religion; and plunder of public or private property. Hadzic's indictment contends that, in his role as president of the Serbian nationalist forces during the war, he attempted to permanently and forcibly remove a majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from the disputed territory. He is accused of murdering or ordering the murders of hundreds of non-Serb citizens, including children and the elderly. Further, he allegedly displaced more than 20,000 non-Serb civilians. Hadzic was found near the small Serbian village of <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=07&dd=20&nav_id=75543">Krusedol</a> [B92 report], living under a false name. Although he was armed, he did not resist arrest. He was discovered after attempting to sell a painting by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, due to running out of money to facilitate his hiding. Hadzic was also reportedly harbored by members of the <a href = "http://www.spc.rs/eng">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> (SPC) [official website]. Hadzic was the final remaining war criminal at large from the Bosnian Civil War, along with <a href = "/currentawareness/mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive], who was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">arrested in May</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge James Selna <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-toyota-acceleration-lawsuit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the class action suit against Toyota in May, allowing consumers who had not experienced the acceleration defect to <a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wnij/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1829784/Business/Judge.says.Toyota.can.appeal.ruling.in.lawsuit">join the class action lawsuit</a> [Reuters report] and seek economic damages. Toyota owners alleged that their vehicles lost value because the company failed to disclose and fix the acceleration problems, a claim Toyota disputes. When Selna finalizes his ruling next week, Toyota will be permitted to appeal the decision to the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>In December, Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/toyota-agrees-to-pay-additional-32-million-in-fines-to-us-government.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] US federal investigations by agreeing to pay a record $32.4 million in extra fines for product defects and poor handling of a recall. The fines stem from two investigations conducted by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot7110.htm">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website]. The first, a fine of $16.375 million, concerned nearly five million vehicles with accelerator pedals entrapped by floor mats, which caused at least one fatal accident in California. The second, a fine of $16.050 million, resulted from Toyota's failure to notify the NHTSA of a safety defect in several Toyota models' steering relay rods. Toyota has been under federal scrutiny since December 2009, and has conducted several recalls. Toyota's product recalls have been analyzed by Forum guest columnist Bruce Aronson of Creighton University School of Law in the op-ed <a href="/forumy/2010/02/learning-from-toyotas-troubles-wheres.php">Learning from Toyota's Troubles - Where's the Board?</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttaiwan.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Taiwan established an anti-corruption agency Wednesday in an effort to quell corruption among government officials. The Agency Against Corruption (AAC) <a href="http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aIPL&ID=201107200027">aims to reduce and deter corruption</a> [CNA report], raise conviction rates for corrupt officials and protect human rights. The agency is composed of 180 members who, along with other law enforcement authorities, will handle investigations into ethics violations. Cases will then be turned over to federal prosecutors. Members of the <a href="http://www.kmt.org.tw/">Kuomintang</a> (KMT) [official website, in Chinese], a Taiwanese political party, urged the AAC to promise a 10 percent increase in the country's corruption conviction rate, alleging that citizens are dissatisfied with the current 55 percent conviction rate.

<p>Corruption has become increasingly problematic in Taiwan. Former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on-embezzlement-charges.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in June on charges of money laundering and embezzling money from a secret diplomatic fund. Earlier that same month, Taiwan's <a href="http://www.judicial.gov.tw/">Judicial Yuan</a> [official website] President Lai Hau-min <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/taiwan-passes-controversial-new-law-to-remove-judges.php">announced a new law</a> [JURIST report] to remove judges deemed by a committee to have been involved in corrupt activities. In November 2010, the Taiwan Supreme Prosecutors Office <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/taiwan-judicial-officials-indicted-on-bribery-corruption-charges.php">indicted 13 people</a> [JURIST report], including three High Court judges, on charges of bribery, corruption and money laundering. The three judges were accused of accepting more than NT $5 million (USD $155,000) from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ho+Chi">former legislator Ho Chi-Hui</a> [JURIST news archive] in exchange for clearing him of charges related to a corrupt land-development project. Last August, the <a href="http://www.tpc.moj.gov.tw/mp103.html">Taipei Prosecutors Office</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/taiwan-prosecutors-raid-judges.php">conducted raids</a> [JURIST report] on the homes of several High Court judges and 18 other locations searching for evidence related to the bribery deals. The three High Court judges were <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/taiwan-judicial-officials-arrested-for-corruption.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges in July 2010 and were suspended from duty following their arrests.

A specially appointed chamber found Hartmann <a href = "/paperchase/2009/09/icty-ex-spokesperson-found-guilty-of.php">guilty of contempt</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 for revealing confidential judicial decisions. Tuesday's judgment reinforced that Hartmann had done irreparable damage to the ICTY's mission:<blockquote>[T]he Appeals Chamber observes that the Trial Chamber found that the effect of Hartmann's disclosure of confidential information decreased the likelihood that states would cooperate with the Tribunal in the future, thereby undermining its ability to exercise its jurisdiction to prosecute and punish serious violations of humanitarian law. The Trial Chamber further found that prosecuting an individual for contempt under these circumstances was proportionate to the effect her actions had on the Tribunal's ability to administer international criminal justice. The Appeals Chamber is therefore of the view that the Trial Chamber was correct to conclude that Rule 54 of the Rules permits the Tribunal to impose confidentiality in an effort to secure the cooperation of sovereign states. In light of the foregoing, the Appeals Chamber is satisfied that the Trial Chamber adequately took into account all relevant considerations to ensure that its Judgement was rendered in conformity with international law.</blockquote>Hartmann had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/icty-indicts-former-spokesperson-for.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with two counts of contempt for allegedly disclosing protected information of appellate chamber decisions from the trial of former Serbian president <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] in a book and an article she wrote in 2007 and 2008. She was fined &#8364;7,000, which the court also upheld.

<p>Hartmann's <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/icty-ex-spokeswoman-contempt-trial.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009. At an initial appearance, Hartmann did <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/former-icty-spokesperson-defers-plea-on.php">not enter a plea</a> [JURIST report] and a plea of not guilty was entered on her behalf. Hartmann formally served as the official spokesperson for chief ICTY prosecutor <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla del Ponte</a> [BBC profile]. Before being indicted, Hartmann drew media attention by <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/western-nations-blocked-karadzic-arrest.php">repeating allegations</a> [JURIST report] that former US president Bill Clinton and former French president Jacques Chirac had <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-and-allies-impeded-efforts-to.php">planned a campaign</a> [JURIST report] to capture <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/876084.stm">Radovan Karadzic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>], but later backed down following a change in policy. Hartmann has also said that Russia aided in moving Karadzic to safety in Belarus, and alleged that the West helped in order to hide information about the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google Inc.</a> [case materials], a copyright suit filed in 2005 over a <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html">Google</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GOOG:US">backgrounder</a>] initiative to <a href="http://books.google.com/">scan and catalog books</a> [Google Book Search website] to make them more accessible online. Google and the <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/">Authors Guild</a> [advocacy website], a group representation authors and publishers, also received an <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-01/google-publishers-discussing-options-for-book-scan-accord-lawyer-says.html">extension at the beginning of June</a> [Bloomberg report], leading to Tuesday's conference. Judge Denny Chin set a hearing for September 15 and stated that if a reasonable settlement is not reached the <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-19/google-authors-ask-for-more-time-to-discuss-scanning-settlement.html">parties will go to trial</a> [Bloomberg report]. He also suggested focusing negotiations on an <a href = "http://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202503369547">"opt-in" function</A> [NYLJ report] for authors rather than "opt-out." A <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-rejects-google-books-settlement.php">settlement was reached in March 2009</a> [JURIST report], but Chin rejected it, partially for allowing authors' silence to operate as an automatic opt-in to the program.

<p>The first settlement agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/google-agrees-to-settle-two-copyright.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008, and arguments on the ASA were heard in February 2010, after which Chin announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-hears-arguments-on-google.php">delay ruling</a> [JURIST report] on the proposed settlement. Earlier that month the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/doj-urges-additional-revisions-to.php">statement of interest</a> [JURIST report] urging the court to reject the settlement due to copyright and antitrust concerns, and stating that the agreement would provide Google with "anticompetitive advantages" with potentially monopolistic effects. The DOJ's statement of interest was filed after an official inquiry, which was <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-to-investigate-antitrust.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] six months after the original settlement agreement was reached. Meanwhile, concerns had been raised in the European Union and elsewhere that Google's book-scanning initiative violated national copyright laws, especially in France where a Parisian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-court-rules-google-book-search.php">fined Google</a> [JURIST report] &#8364;300,000 (USD $430,000) for digitizing books and making excerpts available on the web. The Authors Guild represents several major publishing companies, including the <a href="http://www.publishers.org/">Association of American Publishers</a> (AAP) [association website], <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/">McGraw-Hill</a>, <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/aboutus/index.html">Penguin Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.simonsays.com/content/feature.cfm?feature_id=1625&amp;tab=1">Simon &amp; Schuster</a> [corporate websites].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/files/serve?File_id=f30d329b-79bd-4f8b-a2dd-6b512018fa7c">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the president, chairman of the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/">House Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] Howard McKeon and other officials from the Intelligence, Judiciary, Foreign Relations, and Homeland Security Committees criticized the administration for its lack of comprehensive policies for dealing with terror suspects. The letter comes in response to the Obama administration's handling of terror suspect Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/us-brings-somali-terror-suspect-to-new-york-for-civil-trial.php">brought to the US</a> [JURIST report] in July to face a civil trial in New York, a decision that has sparked harsh criticism from lawmakers who want terror suspects to be held at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detention facility. Warsame was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/07/05/somali.terror.suspect/">captured by US forces in April</a> [CNN report] somewhere in the Gulf region and detained on a US Navy ship for questioning until being sent to the US for trial. The lawmakers criticized the administration for limiting use of military detention and prosecution and called on Obama to articulate his position on detention policies:<blockquote>By foreclosing these options and failing to create a long-term detention regime that puts a priority on intelligence collection and keeping terrorists out of the United States&#8212;combined with reluctance to consult or collaborate with Congress on these issues&#8212;the Administration has forced Congress to take action on these issues. These concerns are only heightened given the decision to handle Warsame's case in a manner that directly contradicts pending legislation.</blockquote>The lawmakers also pointed to immigration issues that arise when a suspect is detained in the US and discussed the experiences of other countries that have become "safe havens" for terror suspects. 

<p>US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">consistently advocated</a> [JURIST report] that terror suspects be tried in civilian courts despite finding little support from Congress. Last month, Holder gave a speech <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ag-holder-defends-prosecuting-terror-suspects-in-civilian-courts.php">defending the civil court system for terror suspects</a> [JURIST report] saying he will, "defend the exclusive right of the executive branch to determine appropriate venues and mechanisms for all criminal trials," and that he will, "continue to point [to] one indisputable fact ... proven repeatedly by this administration and the previous one: in disrupting potential attacks and effectively interrogating, prosecuting, and incarcerating terrorists, there is quite simply no more powerful tool than our civilian court system." In April, Holder announced that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder, who wanted the accused be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report], referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US. Holder refused to delay the trial any longer for the sake of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families, explaining that the restrictions are not likely to be repealed in the immediate future. The Obama administration changed its position despite repeated appeals from rights groups to utilize civilian courts over military commissions for the trials of suspected terrorists. However, international pressure to use civilian courts remains. Last March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">hold civilian trials</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and other suspected terrorists saying that the military commissions system is fatally flawed and cannot be reformed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Inmates of Pelican Bay's Security Housing Unit (SHU), a long-term isolation ward where one-third of the prison's population is held in solitary confinement, are the instigators of the strike, and most of the strikers in other prisons are inmates in solitary confinement. The prisoners <a href = "http://www.change.org/petitions/support-prisoners-on-hunger-strike-at-pelican-bay-state-prison">demand</a> [advocacy website]: an end to group punishments, abolition of a policy of interrogating alleged gang members for information and punishing them with solitary confinement if the information isn't good enough, prisons abiding by the recommendations in the <a href = "http://www.prisoncommission.org/pdfs/Confronting_Confinement.pdf">US Commission on Safety and Abuse in Prisons 2006 report</a> [text, PDF], increased quality of sanitary conditions and meals and an expansion of programs for those inmates indefinitely confined in the SHU. At the peak of the strike <a href = "http://www.triplicate.com/20110707112475/News/Local-News/Hunger-strike-continues-at-Pelican-Bay">6600 prisoners refused meals</a> [<em>Daily Triplicate</em> report], but a prisoner is not considered to be on a hunger strike unless they refuse food for nine consecutive days. Advocates and prisoners' attorneys are claiming <a href = "http://www.triplicate.com/20110714112520/News/Local-News/State-denies-inmates-are-in-bad-shape">some inmates are becoming critically ill</a> [<em>Daily Triplicate</em> report] as a result of the fast, but the <a href = "http://www.cphcs.ca.gov/">California Prison Health Care Services</a> [official website] denies this. The California Prison Health Care Services released a <a href = "http://www.cphcs.ca.gov/hungerstrike.aspx">statement</a> [text] that "sufficient medical resources are available to care for inmates who are participating in the hunger strike." <a href = "http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> [official website] spokesperson Terry Thornton also denied that prisoners were put in SHU arbitrarily and stated that there is a continual open dialogue with prisoners. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is also <a href = "http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-prison-20110719%2C0%2C3168524.story">denying the media access to the striking inmates</a> [LAT report].

<p>California has come under criticism in the past year for its overcrowded prison system. In May, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an order requiring California to release up to 46,000 prisoners to remedy the state's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+prison">overcrowded prisons</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court concluded that the extreme overcrowding of the California prison system is causing inmates to receive inadequate medical care in violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text]. In August 2009, a special panel of federal judges <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judges-order-california-to.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] California to reduce its prison population by about 46,000 inmates or construct more facilities to handle the prisoners. <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] submitted a <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/6.7.11-Response-to-1.12.10-Order.pdf">plan</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/3_judge_panel_decision.html">materials</a>] in June to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/california-submits-plan-to-reduce-prison-population-to-meet-court-order.php">reduce the prison population by over 30,000 inmates</a> [JURIST report]. The submitted plan outlines measures that the state was taking to reduce prison populations including the passage of <a href="http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/billtrack/text.html?bvid=20110AB10995CHP">AB 109</a> [text], which once funded by the legislature, will transfer adult prisoners to local jails. The bill, which is already being implemented, is meant to reduce crowding by restructuring the parole system, providing inmates with more opportunities to earn early release credits, creating an alternative rehabilitative program for parole violators rather than being sent back to prison, and changing the law to increase the threshold for felonies in crimes that could be a misdemeanor depending on the amount stolen. The number of inmates currently in California prisons is approximately 143,500, about a 19,000 inmate reduction from 2006 when the plaintiffs filed their motions to convene the three-judge panel. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Hammarberg said the bans may not conform to European human rights standards such as the right to respect for personal life and personal identity. He noted that there are sometimes compelling reasons for requiring women to remove the veils in certain circumstances, including safety or for identification purposes. However, he said that the bans are repressive and that targeting women is not the solution. Hammarberg emphasized that the laws could have unintended consequences:<blockquote>It is more likely that such laws&#8212;so obviously targeting the adherents of one religious faith&#8212;would further stigmatise these women and lead to their alienation from the majority society. Banning women dressed in the burqa/niqab from public institutions like hospitals or government offices may only result in them avoiding such places entirely. This is not liberation.</blockquote>Instead of penalizing women, Hammarberg said, governments should take action against hate crimes and discrimination against minorities.

<p>Belgium's interim cabinet announced last week that the nation will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-officially-bans-burqa.php">officially banning the burqa</a> [JURIST report] beginning July 23. A French Muslim couple living in the UK <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-muslim-couple-to-challenge-burqa-ban-in-echr-spain-court-uupholds-city-ban.php">filed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] last month in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] over the French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/dissimulation_visage_espace_public.asp">ban</a> [materials, in French] on full face coverings. Also in June, a Spanish court upheld a city ban on veils in municipal buildings for identification and security purposes. Under the French ban, people caught wearing facial coverings in public can be fined &#8364;150 (USD $215) and/or ordered to take a citizenship class. In addition, anyone convicted of forcing a someone else to cover their face may be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEgiMW33brZhPohZrPSXS_zbE8lQ?docId=CNG.454c1042a774374e5f29a46c701d14b2.7b1">fined up to 30,000 euro and jailed for one year</a> [AFP report, in French], and the penalties double if the incident involves a minor. The ban affects citizens, residents and tourists alike, and extends to <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/04/08/01016-20110408ARTFIG00630-voile-signes-religieux-ce-qui-est-interdit-en-france.php">all public places</a> [<em>Le Figaro</em> backgrounder, in French], including airports, hospitals, government offices and even places of worship that are open to the public. In October, the French Constitutional Council ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ban conforms with the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Also in October, Dutch politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=103">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website, in Dutch] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition. In August, Austria's conservative <a href="http://www.fpoe.at/">Freedom Party</a> [official website, in German] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/conservative-austria-party-calls-for-vote-to-ban-minarets-face-veils.php">special vote</a> [JURIST report] on whether to ban face veils and the construction of minarets, two of the most visible symbols of the Islamic faith. In July, Spain's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/spain-lower-house-rejects-proposal-to-ban-burqa.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to ban the burqa and other full face veils by a vote of 183 to 162 with two abstaining.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last week, Chiesi <A href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ex-hedge-fund-trader-settles-sec-civil-charges.php">agreed to pay USD $540,000 to settle a civil charge</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website].

<p>A federal jury <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report</a>] Rajaratnam in May on all 14 counts of insider trading. New Castle is said to have gained at least $1.7 million from the trades. Chiesi reportedly got the information from former IBM executive Robert Moffat, with whom she was having an affair. Moffat is currently serving six months in prison for insider trading in connection with the Galleon case. Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in September and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after he <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] the previous March.

Bangladesh has conducted a series of military and civil trials for the thousands of citizens and soldiers involved in the mutiny, which left 74 dead. All of the indicted, before the court in shackles, <A href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jlRKMb8nD6QV1ZFofPpfWx_rKlPA?docId=35918ae9eaa142f7b49488a42d96bf74">pleaded not guilty</a> [AP report]. Two unnamed politicians were indicted, including a member of the ruling party, the <a href = "http://www.albd.org/autoalbd/index.php">Awami League</a> [official website]. Remaining suspects of the more than 800 civilians arrested will be arraigned on July 27.

<p>Last month, a Bangladesh military court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/bangladesh-jails-more-than-650-soldiers-in-connection-to-2009-mutiny.php">sentenced 657 border guards for their part in the mutiny</a> [JURIST report], bringing the total number of soldiers jailed for the mutiny to more than 3,000. Last January, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/bangladesh-court-opens-trial-of-800-soldiers-charged-in-2009-mutiny.php">civilian trial of 800 soldiers charged</a> [JURIST report] with crimes stemming from their roles in the 2009 mutiny began in the capital city of Dhaka. The trial involves some of the most serious charges with those found guilty facing the death penalty. The trial is expected to last over a year and to include the testimonies of more than 1,000 individuals. In August 2010, a special Bangladeshi military court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bangladesh-court-convicts-14-border-guards-in-mutiny-trial.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 14 members of the BDR for their roles in the mutiny. The tribunal, led by BDR head Maj. Gen. Mainul Islam, fined each of the men Tk 100 and <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=169661&cid=2">sentenced</a> [BDNews24 report] them to prison terms ranging from four months to six years, one year short of the maximum possible sentence for rebellion under Bangladeshi law. About 3,500 other soldiers will face lesser charges in military courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontantiabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Ohio <a href="http://www.governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] on Wednesday signed into law a bill banning <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive] after 20 weeks. The <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_SB_72_PS_Y.pdf">legislation</a> [SB 72 text, PDF] requires doctors to determine the viability of the fetus and seek a second opinion as to whether the child is capable of surviving outside of the womb. In the event that the fetus is viable, an abortion would only be made available if the woman faced "death or a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function." <a href="http://www.ohiolife.org/">Ohio Right to Life</a> [advocacy website] Executive Director Mike Gonidakis <a href="http://www.ohiolife.org/press-releases/2011/7/20/thank-you-governor-john-kasich.html">applauded</a> [press release] the governor's endorsement of the bill:<blockquote>In order to protect life, it takes compassionate leadership from our elected officials. By signing this critical pro-life legislation, Governor Kasich demonstrated to all Ohioans that the health and welfare of birth mothers and their unborn children are of paramount importance to the state of Ohio ... From now on, these babies and their mothers will be protected.</blockquote><a href="http://www.prochoiceohio.org/news/press/201107201.shtml">NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio</a> [advocacy website], on the other hand, <a href="http://www.prochoiceohio.org/news/press/201107201.shtml">denounced the legislation</a> [press release], calling it "a serious threat to women's health that opens the door to even more political interference in the doctor-patient relationship." Opponents of the law are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/20/us-abortion-ohio-idUSTRE76J5XJ20110720">attempting to gather signatures</a> [Reuters report] supporting a November voter referendum to repeal the law. The law has yet to take effect.

<p>Ohio's legislation is part of a wave of acts passed by state legislatures since the November elections aimed at restricting abortions in the wake of disputed medical evidence that suggests that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/05/us-abortion-idaho-idUSTRE7347EL20110405">fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks</a> [Reuters report]. In June, the <a href="http://www.house.state.oh.us/">Ohio House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 54-43 to approve <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=129_HB_125">legislation</a> [HB 125] that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ohio-lawmakers-approve-bill-prohibiting-abortion-after-fetal-heartbeat-detection.php">prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable</a> [JURIST report], which could occur as early as six weeks into the pregnancy. The <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] also voted in June in favor of a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy</a> [JURIST report], making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. In May, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] upheld an Ohio <a target="_blank" href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2919.123">law</a> [2919.123 text] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-upholds-ohio-law-limiting-abortion-pill.php">limits the use of the "abortion pill"</a> [JURIST report], overturning a 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-rules-ohio-anti-abortion.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report]. Oklahoma has also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">prohibited the use of mifepristone</a>, and the drug is <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-north-dakota-abortion-law.php">slated to be banned</a> [JURIST reports] in North Dakota on August 1. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Assailants launched rocket-propelled grenades at Condes' home, and three people were killed, including one of his bodyguards. The <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/19/guinea-attack-arrests-idINL6E7IJ1VG20110719">suspects include</a> [Reuters report] former army leader General Nouhou Thiam and a past member of Conde's presidential guard. Conde delivered an address later in the day on state radio assuring investors that the country is not unstable and asking citizens to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hxhFIqBCuBT9adCUHwmsj8OHQl-A?docId=e15f4d7a50af4bdba0677b224f4a0fd2">remain calm</a> [AP report] and unite. The attacks were "strongly condemned" by UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] who urged the citizens of Guinea to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5422">maintain peace and democracy</a> [statement] in the country. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] also issued a <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/07/168844.htm">statement condemning the attacks</a> [text]:<blockquote>The Guinean people fought long and hard for the right to choose their leader and have a representative government.  Overthrowing a democratic government through force is unacceptable.  These violent acts undermine democracy and the rule of law and threaten stability in the region.  The United States calls on the people of Guinea to remain committed to the principles of democracy and to express disagreements through peaceful means.</blockquote>In December, the Supreme Court of Guinea <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/guinea-high-court-declares-conde-winner-of-presidential-election.php">declared Conde the winner</a> [JURIST report] of the country's presidential run-off election held in November. This election ended two years of military rule under a transitional government formed by military captain <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8280880.stm">Moussa Dadis Camara</a> [BBC profile], who staged a coup in the wake of the death of form president <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/23/lansana-conte-profile">Lansana Conte</a> [<em>Guardian</em> profile], who ruled the nation for 24 years.

<p>Guinea was also embroiled in political violence late last year when the presidential election gave way to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ICC-prosecutor-condemns-Guinea-post-election-violence.php">post-election violence</a> [JURIST report], resulting in the deaths of seven people and causing the government to declare a state of emergency. The deputy prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) lamented the killings along with the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR). In October, the OHCHR expressed concern that security forces in Guinea <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-rights-office-says-guinea-security-forces-committed-abuses-in-election-demonstrations.php">"committed serious human rights violations"</a> [JURIST report] in subduing demonstrations. In September, two Guinean election officials were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guinea-officials-convicted-of-election-fraud.php">convicted of election fraud</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced to a year in jail in connection with irregularities that arose in the June presidential primary election, one incident in a string of controversies responsible for multiple delays of the runoff, which was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/guineaNews/idAFLDE66K1LY20100721?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">initially scheduled for July</a> [Reuters report]. In May, the ICC sent a delegation from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/">Office of the Prosecutor</a> (OTP) [official website] to Guinea to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icc-prosecutors-investigating-2009-military-violence-in-guinea.php">further investigate the killing</a> [JURIST report] of more than 150 pro-democracy protesters in Conakry in September 2009. The protesters had rallied against Camara, who announced in October that he intended to push elections forward three months and stand for election, breaking a promise not to run made shortly after he took power. Camara was ultimately forced into exile two months later after an assassination attempt staged by one of his aides.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hicks spent more than five years without trial in US custody after being captured in Afghanistan following the terror attacks of <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. He wrote an autobiography last year entitled "Guantanamo: My Journey," describing his tenure as a detainee. The Australian <a href="http://www.dpp.sa.gov.au/">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hmT7BqGRSwXlwQPpyDv-drUrW3xA?docId=CNG.37a42dba68afeb76259449f2e6a7fe47.f1">applied for a restraining order</a> [AFP reporter] and an order to obtain the book's profits, claiming the profits constitute proceeds of a crime. Pursuant to Australian proceeds of crime law amendments <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/australia-would-change-law-to-bar-hicks.php">tailored specifically to the Hicks case</a> [JURIST report], the ex-detainee is not permitted to profit from his book. Hicks <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/hicks-pleads-guilty-to-supporting.php">pleaded guilty</a> to a <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-re-charging-guantanamo-detainees.php">charge of providing material support</a> [JURIST reports] to terrorists at an appearance before a US military commission in March 2007 and was sentenced to nine months in prison. He was then <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/hicks-transferred-to-australia-to.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to a maximum security prison near his hometown of Adelaide, South Australia to serve the remainder of his nine-month prison sentence. 

<p>Under the plea agreement, Hicks was required to state that he "has never been illegally treated" while being held as an enemy combatant by the US and that his detention was lawful pursuant to the laws of armed conflict. Hicks was also prohibited from having contact with the media for a period of one year, ordered not take any legal action against the United States for his treatment during his five-year detention, and required to turn over any profits from an eventual sale of his story to the Australian government. Hicks' detention and trial have been heavily criticized, with the Law Council of Australia, for example, calling Hicks' trial a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/australia-lawyers-group-says-hicks.php">"charade"</a> [JURIST report]. JURIST Special Guest Columnist and former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser argued that Hicks' trial before a US military commission demonstrated the disturbing willingness of two allegedly democratic governments to abandon the rule of law for an expedient and evil purpose in his <a href="/forum/2007/04/us-australia-and-david-hicks-abandoning.php">op-ed</a> entitled "The US, Australia and David Hicks: Abandoning the Rule of Law." </p>]]></content:encoded>

Palacio's editorial, <a href = "http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/02/06/1/1363/mentiras.html">"No to the Lies!"</a> [text, in Spanish] was published in February 2011 and referenced an incident in September 2010 when protesting police officers fired tear gas at Correa, surrounded the hospital at which he was being treated and trapped him there for 12 hours. Palacio's editorial criticized Correa for pardoning the criminals and suggested he was doing so because the "attempted coup" was staged to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/10/ecuador-to-revise-austerity-law-following-unrest.php">increase his political power</a> [JURIST report].<blockquote>What happens is that the dictator finally realized (or his lawyers understood) that's how [staged] the alleged crime of September 30 was, as everything was the result of an improvised script. ... At this point, all the "evidence" to accuse the "coup" is disjointed: the Dictator recognizes that the terrible idea for the Regiment to go to Quito and join the force was his. No one could prepare to kill him because nobody expected it. ... The Dictator should remember, finally, and this is very important for pardons in the future; a new President, perhaps his enemy, could lead him to a criminal court for ordering fire at will and without warning on a hospital full of civilians and innocent people. Crimes against humanity, do not forget, do not prescribe.</blockquote>Judge Juan Paredas found <em>El Universo</em> in violation of Article 489 of the <a href = "http://www.miliarium.com/Paginas/Leyes/Internacional/Ecuador/General/cp.pdf">Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish], "Slander occurs when there is any statement to discredit, dishonor or disparage another person, or any action performed with the same objective." Correa's lawyer, Vera Alembert, <a href = "http://www.elciudadano.gov.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26222:qsentencia-es-un-simbolo-de-la-lucha-por-la-verdadera-libertad-de-expresionq&catid=40:actualidad&Itemid=63>called the verdict</a> [statement in <em>El Ciudadano</em>, in Spanish] a symbol in the struggle between the president and his opposition and "brought true freedom of expression." However, Correa <A href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-21/ecuador-judge-orders-prison-fine-for-owners-of-el-universo.html">may appeal</a> [Bloomberg report] to achieve the $80 million fine he originally sought. Palacio will appeal.

<p>Correa remains resolute that the media in Ecuador is corrupt and must be harnessed. In a <a href = "http://www.elciudadano.gov.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26227:presidente-correa-se-esta-acabando-el-reino-del-terror-marcado-por-la-prensa-corrupta&catid=40:actualidad&Itemid=63">statement</a> [<em>El Ciudadano</em>, in Spanish], he called the suit one of his greatest legacies, and that now the Ecuadoran "corrupt press" know they cannot "damage the honor of a person." He also pointed to <em>El Universo</em>'s willingness to apologize as a sign of their culpability: "[T]hey knew they had committed a crime, but pride prevented them, as required by the Constitution, to correct [their error]." <em>El Universo</em>, in fact, offered several times to retract the editorial, allow Correa to write his own correction and settle out-of-court, but Correa's lawyer <a href = "http://news.yahoo.com/ecuador-president-wins-huge-libel-case-010852834.html">refused their settlement offers</a> [AFP report]. <em>El Universo</em> remains defiant. The newspaper's front page on the day of the verdict displayed a headline of "Condemned" followed by an Ayn Rand quotation: "When you see that men get richer by graft and pull than by work, and your laws don&#8217;t protect you against them, but protect them against you&#8212;when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice&#8212;you may know that your society is doomed." <em>El Universo</em>'s <a href = "http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/07/21/1/1355/juez-otorga-correa-40-millones-dispone-prision-directivos-diario.html?p=1354&m=1835">report</a> [text, in Spanish] states they believe Ecuador's libel laws are in violation of the <a href = "http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website], for using criminal law to punish expressions against public officials. Correa has another suit pending against journalists Juan Carlos Calderon and Christian Zurita for their book <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Hermano-Carlos-Calder%C3%B3n-Christian-Zurita/dp/9978230513">Big Brother</a> [Amazon profile], which claimed that Correa's brother had awarded millions of dollars of government contracts to businesses for his own profit. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] criticized Correa rallying  against journalists earlier this year and <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/31/ecuador-don-t-prosecute-president-s-critics">pleaded with him to not prosecute journalists</a> [report text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission will investigate the abuses and <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE76K02420110721">provide recommendations</a> [Reuters report] for implementing measures to prevent similar incidents. Ouattara promised to "take legal action against the perpetrators" if necessary and called on the commission to cooperate with international human rights organizations working to uncover details about the abuses. The Ivory Coast had announced last month it would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">establish its own commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of disputed presidential elections. Ouattara gave the commission six months to report the results of the investigation.

<p>The commission is not the first effort to investigate violence in the country. Last month, the Ivory Coast <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ivory-coast-signs-accord-allowing-icc-investigation-to-proceed.php">granted permission</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to proceed with an investigation into the violence. An official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry also <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against Gbagbo supporters last month. Earlier in June, the Ivory Coast <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-issues-international-arrest-warrants-for-gbagbo-aides.php">issued international arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gbagbo aides. The prosecutor's office in the capital Abidjan <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE76013E20110701?sp=true">issued the warrants</a> [Reuters report], most notably for Charles Ble Goude, the leader of Gbagbo's youth militia, accusing him of inciting ethnic violence and attacks against UN workers. Other members of Gbagbo's government also had warrants issued for them including the government spokesman Ahoua Don Mello, industry minister Phillipe Attey, and the ambassador to Israel Raymond Koudou Kessie. Twenty-one others already in detention were charged for violence and inciting tribalism and xenophobia. Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured and forced from office</a> [JURIST report] after refusing to leave despite losing last November's election to Ouattara, which resulted in months of fighting between Ouattara's and Gbagbo's forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR52/001/2011/en/2b90b425-0742-4c83-87f0-e8fd0b6baa51/afr520012011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "In the Line of Fire: Somalia's Children Under Attack," AI provides evidence indicating that armed conflict in areas of Somalia has led to deteriorating human rights conditions, particularly for children. Armed military and civilian forces, like the Islamic terrorist group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/18650/">al-Shabaab</a> [CFR backgrounder], regularly recruit Somalian children to serve as soldiers, often denying access to education and placing the children in danger of death and injury. The report contains vignettes illustrating the impact of fighting outbreaks on Somali youth. AI Deputy Director for Africa Michelle Kagari describes some of the human rights abuses Somalian children experience:<blockquote>Somalia is not only a humanitarian crisis: it is a human rights crisis and a children's crisis. As a child in Somalia, you risk death all the time: you can be killed, recruited and sent to the frontline, punished by al-Shabab because you are caught listening to music or 'wearing the wrong clothes', be forced to fend for yourself because you have lost your parents or even die because you don't have access to adequate medical care.</blockquote>AI expressed concern that human rights abuses in Somalia are under-reported because dangerous conditions prevent accurate, comprehensive reporting. AI also enumerated recommendations for protecting children, including calls to monitor military recruitment more effectively, initiate investigations and cooperate with international human rights organizations. 

<p>Somalia has come under fire for its poor human rights record. The <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials], released in April by the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website], outlined <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">rights set-backs</a> [JURIST report] under the Transitional Federal Government in Mogadishu, but noted progress in <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154369.htm">Somalia</a> [material], particularly in the autonomous regions of Somaliland and Puntland. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said that human rights violations committed during recent Somalian conflicts, including recruitment of child soldiers, <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/somalia-violence-may-constitute-war.php">may amount to war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/war-crimes-being-committed-in-somalia.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 that war crimes and other human rights violations are being committed in the ongoing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4760775.stm">Somali conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].

Their <a href="http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/07/ap-piracy-suspects-deny-killing-americans-072011/">charges included</a> [AP report] murder, piracy, hostage taking and violence against maritime navigation resulting in death, among other charges. The men were <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/three-somali-pirates-charged-in-highjacking-that-killed-4-americans.php">charged earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] and could face the death penalty, which is under consideration by US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website]. At the arraignment, each man requested a jury trial. Due to language barriers and the international nature of the crimes, the trial is expected to go into 2012.

<p>The men are accused of hijacking a US yacht called Quest in February, an incident where four American citizens were taken hostage and later killed by the pirates. They were the first US citizens to die in the recent wave of international maritime piracy attacks. In March, a grand jury in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia indicted 14 suspects, 13 Somali and one Yemeni, for hijacking the Quest. The Yemeni suspect <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/yemeni-pirate-pleads-guilty-to-hijacking-vessel-that-killed-4-us-citizens.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in July and awaits sentencing scheduled for October. Several other suspects <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/two-more-somali-pirates-plead-guilty-in-us-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May. Earlier this month, five Somali pirates <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/5-somalis-go-on-trial-for-piracy-in-dutch-court.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in a Dutch court for hijacking a South African yacht and kidnapping its crew. In April, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">Somali pirate was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to 25 years in prison for attacking a Danish ship off the coast of Somalia in 2008, for which he and other pirates received a $1.7 million ransom. In May, courts in both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/spain-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-439-years.php">Spain</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-korea-court-sentences-4-somali-pirates.php">South Korea</a> [JURIST reports] sentenced Somali pirates to life imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement does affirm that depleting resources has been, and will continue to be, the cause of several international conflicts:<blockquote>The Security Council notes that in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security under its consideration, conflict analysis and contextual information on, inter alia, possible security implications of climate change is important, when such issues are drivers of conflict, represent a challenge to the implementation of Council mandates or endanger the process of consolidation of peace. In this regard, the Council requests the Secretary-General to ensure that his reporting to the Council contains such contextual information.</blockquote>China also felt the debate was inappropriate for the Security Council, arguing the organization should focus strictly on peacekeeping missions. UN <A href = "http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] made <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5424">remarks</a> [text] on climate change to the Council, explaining why such a discussion is appropriate:<blockquote>We must make no mistake. The facts are clear: climate change is real; it is accelerating in a dangerous manner; and it not only exacerbates threats to international peace and security, it is a threat to international peace and security. Extreme weather events continue to grow more frequent and intense in rich and poor countries alike, not only devastating lives, but also infrastructure, institutions, and budgets&#8212;an unholy brew which can create dangerous security vacuums. Pakistan, the Pacific Islands, Russia, Western Europe, the Philippines, Colombia, Australia, Brazil, the United States, China, the Horn of Africa&#8212;these examples should remind us of the urgency of what we face.</blockquote>A presidential statement typically occurs when the Council cannot reach enough of consensus to pass a resolution. Security Council members may abstain from a statement, but none did in this instance. Statements are not legally binding to countries in the UN.

<p>In December 2007, the <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_13/items/4049.php">UN Climate Change Conference</a> [official website] agreed in Bali, Indonesia, to a timetable for negotiating an <a href = "/paperchase/2007/12/un-climate-conference-pledges-new.php">international treaty on global warming</a> [JURIST report]. Under the <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_13/application/pdf/cp_bali_action.pdf">"Bali Roadmap"</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20071215_bali_final_press_release.pdf">press release</a>, PDF], the 187 participating nations pledged to a negotiate a new agreement to replace the expiring <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html">Kyoto Protocol</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kyoto+protocol">news archive</a>] at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. This resulted in the <a href = "http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/l07.pdf">Copenhagen Accord</a> [text, PDF], which is not legally binding nor replaces the Kyoto Protocol, but endorses the continuation of the Protocol. The 2010 UN Climate Change Conference also resulted in no major binding agreements for nations. The next climate change conference is scheduled for November 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The motion, filed in the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website], claims the controversial Alabama <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">law</a> [HB 56 text] that expands restrictions on undocumented immigrants is unconstitutional. The law contains measures comparable to those <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">passed in Arizona</a> [JURIST report] last year including authorizing police officers to detain an individual on "reasonable suspicion" the individual is in the country illegally, and requirements that businesses use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. The rights groups argue that they are entitled to a preliminary injunction because of their substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury to plaintiffs and because the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest. The rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/1-0_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] earlier this month seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, arguing that HB 56 is preempted by federal law and that, among other constitutional violations, it violates the Fourth Amendment by subjecting citizens and non-citizens with permission to be in the US to unreasonable searches and seizures. 

<p>Alabama <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed HB 56 into law</a> last month, just one week after it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">passed by the legislature</a> [JURIST reports]. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. In May, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a  href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that an Arizona employment law that imposes penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text]. The ruling opens the door for states to enact similar restraints on immigration. Similar laws have been passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports].

The provision, which includes an exception for cases of rape, incest or threats to health, is part of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h112-2583">Foreign Relations Authorization Act</a> [text], a larger spending bill. The provision was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-security/house-panel-backs-ban-on-funds-for-international-groups-that-promote-abortions/2011/07/21/gIQA0h7pRI_story.html">met with opposition</a> [AP report] by <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood Federation of America</a> [advocacy website], various women's rights groups and Democrats including <a href="http://www.house.gov/berman/">Rep. Howard Berman</a> (D-CA) [official website], who filed an <a href="http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/markup/SummaryGlobalGagRuleAmendmentBERMAN.pdf">amendment</a> [text, PDF] to strike the section before being outvoted. Berman claimed that, "The Global Gag Rule is a harmful policy that prevents poor women and families around the world from gaining access to essential information and health care services," and also that the "language of the bill ... bars ... assistance [in] HIV/AIDS funding, water and sanitation, child survival, and education."

<p>If approved by the House and Senate, the provision would reverse US President Barack Obama's 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-repeals-international-abortion.php">memorandum that repealed the ban</a> [JURIST report] after reinstatement by the Bush administration. The Gag Rule has been the subject of much debate since the Reagan Administration. The law was named for the location of the UN International Conference on Population (UNICP) held in Mexico City in 1984, where it was originally announced. The funding ban was enacted that same year, but was repealed in 1993 by former president Bill Clinton. The ban was <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/whmemo.html">overturned in 2001</a> [memorandum text] by then-president George W. Bush. In 2007, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/house-votes-to-reverse-ban-on-overseas.php">passed a measure</a> [JURIST report] that would have reversed the funding restrictions, but the bill was never approved by the Senate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kepiro was acquitted of participating in the 1942 Novi Sad massacre in Serbia. Prosecutor Zsolt Falvai <a href = "http://www.kusi.com/story/15106186/prosecution-to-appeal-hungary-war-crimes-acquittal">declared the acquittal unfounded</a> [AP report] and said the three-judge panel had misinterpreted his evidence. The panel found two of his three key pieces of evidence inadmissible: the testimony of a Hungarian Lieutenant in the 1940s who had lied on-record before and was likely under duress, and a prior conviction of Kepiro for the raids that had been annulled. Kepiro persistently denied involvement in the raid and continues to even after his acquittal. His defense lawyer, Zsolt Zetenyi has appealed to the judges to record the acquittal as decided by Kepiro's <a href = "http://ca.news.yahoo.com/apnewsbreak-defence-appeals-acquittal-hungary-war-crimes-trial-114541802.html">lack of involvement in the massacre</a> [AP report], not a lack of evidence. Zetenyi and Kepiro's pleas for vindication may not be unfounded, as Kepiro is still being publicized as a war criminal by several Jewish groups. The <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=6212365">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> (SWC) [advocacy website], a Jewish human rights organization committed to finding and prosecuting Holocaust war criminals, located and apprehended Kepiro in 2006. They released a <a href = "http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&b=4441467&ct=10916597">statement</a> [text] after the acquittal, calling the judgment, "an outrageous miscarriage of justice which directly contradicts the extensive evidence of Kepiro's direct involvement and responsibility." A spokesperson for the Novi Sad Jewish community said that a global campaign will be launched to inform the world if the acquittal stands.

<p>Kepiro's prosecution was likely one of the last of an accused Nazi. In May, the trial of accused Nazi guard <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Demjanjuk">news archive</a>] ended when he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] but released because of his advanced age. An <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/german-prosecutors-vow-to-appeal-demjanjuk-release.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] of his release is pending. In November, Nazi guard <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profile.html?tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=samuel_kunz_936">Samuel Kunz</a> [Trial Watch profile], 89, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/former-nazi-prison-guard-dies-while-awaiting-trial.php">passed away</a> [JURIST report] in his home before he could be brought to trial.

Originally they were charged with "preparing to wage war against the king," but were released and then immediately re-arrested and held under the <a href = "http://genderandtrade.org/Shared_ASP_Files/UploadedFiles/682B259F-937B-4944-B7E1-186B23329DCF_EmergencyLaws1969.pdf">Emergency (Public Order and Crime Prevention) Ordinance</a> (EO) [text, PDF], a law that provides for the government to detain someone indefinitely without trial. The EO has been in place since 1969, and its <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/node/11224/section/1">repeal has been sought by HRW</a> [report text] since 1996. The six are reportedly being held in solitary confinement, blindfolded and subjected to continual intense interrogations. There were an additional 21 PSM members who were arrested and are still charged, but are freed on bail. The six have <em>habeas corpus</em> hearings scheduled for Friday in <A href = "http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/courts/maljudiciary.shtml">Kuala Lumpur High Court</a> [official website], but it is unknown if the political prisoners will be permitted to attend.

<p>Last year, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] urged Malaysia to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-group-urges-malaysia-to-amend-internal-security-laws.php">repeal or amend its internal security laws</a> [JURIST report], which allow indefinite detainment without trial. At the end of an official visit, the group said amending the laws would allow Malaysia to conform to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. Malaysia's internal security laws have been heavily criticized. Last August, a Malaysian court <a href="/2009/08/malaysia-court-charges-protesters-for.php">charged 29 protesters</a> [JURIST report] for their alleged involvement in rallies against the country's Internal Security Act. The demonstration was allegedly started by the <a href="http://abolishisa.wordpress.com/">Abolish ISA Movement</a> [advocacy blog]. The law was protested by an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people in Kuala Lumpur, resulting in 589 arrests and the use of tear gas and water cannons by police. The protesters were charged with aiding an illegal organization or participating in an illegal rally since a police permit was not obtained. At the time, <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7973872.stm">profile</a>] dismissed the protest as being unnecessary since he previously pledged to review the controversial law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Crime fell 5 percent in 2010 to just over two million crimes committed. <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2011/07/21/crime-rate-in-canada-at-lowest-level-since-1973-statscan">Experts cite</a> [<em>Toronto Sun</em> report] Canada's aging population as well as keeping children in school longer as major reasons for the decline. The recent statistics have led opponents of the current administration to criticize recent increased funding for crime prevention and prisons. Canadian <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/pm.asp">Prime Minister Stephen Harper</a> [official website] announced plans last month to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/06/03/harper-government-omnibus_n_870368.html">pass several crime bills</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] that are estimated to add a billion dollars a year to the budget and 4,000 new inmates a year. New measures include eliminating pardons for sexual crimes against children, establishing minimum sentences for drug offenses and implementing preventative arrests for terrorism suspects. 

<p>The Canadian drop in crime mirrors recent trends in the US. In May, the FBI reported that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/fbi-data-shows-decrease-in-violent-crime-by-55.php">violent crime was down 5.5 percent</a> [JURIST report] from 2009 to 2010.

The highest drop was the decrease in robbery at 9.5 percent. The 5.5 percent decrease was down from the 6.2 percent decrease reported in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-violent-crime-rate-drops-for-fourth-straight-year-fbi.php">2010 six-month report from January to June</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Kenyans, who are now over 70 years old, allege that they were <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/top/all/7663074.html">beaten and sexually assaulted</a> [AP report] by British administration officers attempting to quell the <a href="http://www.leighday.co.uk/documents/Press%20Pack-Historical%20Background%20to%20the%20Mau%20Mau%20Claims.doc">Mau Mau uprising</a> [advocacy backgrounder, DOC]. High Court Judge Richard McCombe said the case could proceed despite the government's argument that the alleged abuses occurred too long ago and that all liability of the colonial administration passed to the Kenyan government upon gaining independence in 1963. McCombe said there was "voluminous" evidence suggesting the UK government may be liable to the plaintiffs, but refrained from reaching a judgment on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims. The law firm representing the four Kenyans <a href="http://www.leighday.co.uk/news/news-archive-2011/historic-judgment-as-uk-government-loses-court">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Our clients are delighted that the High Court has rejected the British Government's arguments so emphatically.  It is an outrage that the British Government is dealing with victims of torture so callously.  We call on the British Government to deal with these victims of torture with the dignity and respect they deserve and to meet with them and their representatives in order to resolve the case amicably.</blockquote>The claimants are seeking an apology and compensation for the alleged beatings, sexual abuse, and unlawful detention.

<p>The <a href="http://www.leighday.co.uk/documents/Press%20Packs-Our%20clients%20Biographies.doc">group of four Kenyans</a> [advocacy profiles, DOC], originally five, involved in the country's Mau Mau uprising <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/former-kenya-rebels-sue-uk-over.php">sued the British government</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009, alleging that they were abused in British prison camps. The Mau Mau rebellion was led by members of the largely impoverished <a href="http://www.africaguide.com/culture/tribes/kikuyu.htm">Kikuyu tribe</a> [backgrounder] and lasted from 1952-1960. The uprising was notorious for atrocities committed by both the rebels and British colonial forces. Official casualty figures eventually set the number of European deaths at 32 and the number of Kenyans killed at just over 11,000. Unofficial estimates have put the latter number <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/nov/09/3">as high as 50,000</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Onyango Obama, the Kenyan grandfather of US President Barack Obama, is said to have been detained and tortured during the British government's suppression of the insurgents. Kenya became officially independent from Britain in 1963.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Anti-union and anti-collective bargaining laws have been a major issue of controversy in the US this year.

Hadzic was the last fugitive of the original 161 sought for war crimes by the <a href = "http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">arrested earlier this week</a> [JURIST report].

Croatian President Ivo Josipovic said that although he understands The Hague has jurisdiction, he would like Hadzic to <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=07&dd=22&nav_id=75569">face trial in Croatia</a> [B92 report].

<p>Hadzic was a key player in the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] and has been at large for approximately seven years. Hadzic's <a href = "http://www.icty.org/x/cases/hadzic/cis/en/cis_hadzic_en.pdf">official charges</a> [case information sheet, PDF] are: persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; extermination; murder; torture; inhumane acts; deportation and forcible transfer; cruel treatment; wanton destruction of villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity; destruction or willful damage done to institutions dedicated to education and religion; and plunder of public or private property. Hadzic's indictment contends that, in his role as president of the Serbian nationalist forces during the war, he attempted to permanently and forcibly remove a majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from the disputed territory. He is accused of murdering or ordering the murders of hundreds of non-Serb citizens, including children and the elderly. Further, he allegedly displaced more than 20,000 non-Serb civilians. Hadzic was found near the small Serbian village of <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=07&dd=20&nav_id=75543">Krusedol</a> [B92 report], living under a false name. Although he was armed, he did not resist arrest. He was discovered after attempting to sell a painting by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, due to running out of money to facilitate his hiding. Hadzic was also reportedly harbored by members of the <a href = "http://www.spc.rs/eng">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> (SPC) [official website]. Hadzic was the final remaining war criminal at large from the Bosnian Civil War, along with <a href = "/currentawareness/mladic.php">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive], who was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">arrested in May</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI revealed that the Draft Penal Law for Terrorism Crimes and Financing of Terrorism seeks to punish those who "question the integrity of the King or Crown Prince," with minimum penalties amounting to 10 years in prison. The law permits authorities to extend detention of suspects without charge or trial and authorizes incommunicado detention. AI also contends that the legislation's definition of "terrorist crimes" is broad and would allow authorities to prosecute protestors for a wide range of conduct. AI Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director Philip Luther expressed concern for the law's implications on human rights and called on Saudi Arabian authorities to reconsider the law:<blockquote>This draft law poses a serious threat to freedom of expression in the Kingdom in the name of preventing terrorism. If passed it would pave the way for even the smallest acts of peaceful dissent to be branded terrorism and risk massive human rights violations. At a time when people throughout the Middle East and North Africa have been exercising their legitimate right to express dissent and call for change, Saudi Arabian authorities have been seeking to squash this right for its citizens. King Abdullah must reconsider this law and ensure that his people's legitimate right to freedom of expression is not curtailed in the name of fighting terrorism.</blockquote> AI further claims that the draft law conflicts with international human rights treatises such as the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text].

<p>The proposed law comes in response to recent civil unrest in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern and North African nations, but this is not the first time Saudi Arabia has been criticized for rigid counterterrorism practices. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0809web.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] in 2009 that Saudi Arabia was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/08/04/saudi-arabia-counterterrorism-efforts-violate-rights">illegally detaining thousands</a> [press release] under the auspices of combating terrorism. The report echoed another AI <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/saudi-arabia-human-rights-abuses-name-fighting-terrorism-20090722">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/rights-group-accuses-saudi-arabia-of.php">report</a>] which claimed that Saudi Arabian officials were allegedly using anti-terrorism measures as an excuse to secretly detain, imprison, torture and even kill thousands of people. In February 2009, the US Department of State released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/nea/119126.htm">2008 Report on Human Rights Practices for Saudi Arabia</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">report</a>], in which it identified several significant human rights issues, including denial of public trials and lack of due process in the judicial system, detention of political prisoners, incommunicado detention and lack of government transparency. Saudi Interior Minister <a href="http://www.moi.gov.sa">Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz</a> [official website, in Arabic] announced in October 2008 that the kingdom had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE49K2SI20081021">indicted 991</a> [Reuters report] suspected al Qaeda members. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/16/saudi-arabia-grant-visas-hrw-staff-defendants-trials">sought access</a> [HRW request] to the trials in an attempt to ensure compliance with international standards, but was denied. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/ND_Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text] challenging the North Dakota and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-north-dakota-abortion-law.php">seeking an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on Monday. The law restricts the use of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/postmarketdrugsafetyinformationforpatientsandproviders/ucm111323.htm">mifepristone</a>, <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111315.htm">misoprostol</a> [FDA backgrounders] and other drugs approved by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/default.htm">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] to induce first-trimester abortions. The complaint, filed on behalf of the sole abortion provider in the state, alleges that the law would altogether prohibit medication abortions, preventing women who prefer the non-surgical abortion procedure from obtaining treatment. The plaintiffs also contend that the law is impermissibly vague, constitutes an improper delegation of legislative authority, violates the privileges and immunities and bodily integrity rights of women, and creates an undue burden, among other challenges. <a href="http://www.ndcourts.gov/">North Dakota Supreme Court</a> [official website] Judge Wickham Corwin said "the public is best served if these questions are considered before the challenged provisions are enforced." CRR President and CEO Nancy Northup welcomed the injunction and condemned the law:<blockquote>We are extremely pleased that, for the time being, women in North Dakota will still have access to an alternative to surgical abortion that has been widely recognized as safe and effective by medical experts and organizations around the world. This law has nothing to do with protecting women's health&#8212;it defies reason, science and medical expertise in a clandestine attempt to limit women's access to abortion.</blockquote>The law, which was slated to take effect on August 1, will not be enforced until a hearing takes place on August 29.

<p>North Dakota is one of many states to introduce more restrictive abortion regulations in recent months. In June, the <a href="http://www.house.state.oh.us/">Ohio House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 54-43 to approve <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=129_HB_125">legislation</a> [HB 125] that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ohio-lawmakers-approve-bill-prohibiting-abortion-after-fetal-heartbeat-detection.php">prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable</a> [JURIST report], which could occur as early as six weeks into the pregnancy. The <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] also voted in June in favor of a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy</a> [JURIST report], making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. In May, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] upheld an Ohio <a href="http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2919.123">law</a> [2919.123 text] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-upholds-ohio-law-limiting-abortion-pill.php">limits the use of the "abortion pill"</a> [JURIST report], overturning a 2006 <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-rules-ohio-anti-abortion.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report]. Oklahoma has also <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">prohibited the use of mifepristone</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report is the first to officially provide evidence that national forces perpetrated mass rape, as opposed to reports of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/un-rape-being-used-as-weapon-of-war-in-drc.php">opposition forces using it as a weapon</a> [JURIST report]. Some soldiers in the FARDC allegedly raped 47 women, including a minor, in villages of Bushani and Kalambahiro. The UN also admitted that they had likely given aid to the attackers shortly before the incident.<blockquote>In addition, during its investigation missions in Bushani, the team found packagings bearing the references of food rations distributed to "screened" battalions which received support from MONUSCO within the framework of Operation "Hatua Yamana." In so far as the investigations carried out by the team could establish the presence of the 2331 battalion in particular in the area of the villages attacked between the end of December 2010 and the beginning of January 201129, it cannot be excluded that the alleged perpetrators of the violations were FARDC soldiers who had received support from MONUSCO.</blockquote>MUNUSCO was chastised, and the report recommended they better monitor the support they give to the FARDC. The report criticizes the Congolese government's lack of investigation into FARDC as possible perpetrators and pleaded for further judicial action to prosecute rapists. Also, the report emphasized the need to protect survivors of rape from reprisals, which has been a frequent occurrence to silence victims.

<p>In February, a military court found Lt Col Kibibi Mutware <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/drc-colonel-sentenced-to-20-years-imprisonment-for-mass-rapes.php">guilty of involvement in mass rapes</a> [JURIST report] that took place on New Year's Day and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment, dismissing him from the military. This has been the only action taken on the issue. DRC has been struggling with a number of human rights issues. Last month, a military court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/congo-court-sentences-4-to-death-for-rights-activist-murder.php">sentenced four policemen to death</a> for killing prominent human rights activist Floribert Chebeya last year. In early October, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">called for the DRC government</a> [JURIST report] to arrest general Bosco Ntaganda pursuant to an outstanding warrant for war crimes issued by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Earlier that same week French authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-authorities-arrest-drc-war-crimes-suspect-under-icc-warrant.php">arrested a leader</a> [JURIST report] of the FDLR for crimes committed by that group in the DRC. In October, UN peacekeeping forces and the DRC government <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-forces-arrest-rebel-leader-for-drc-mass-rapes.php">arrested Mai Mai Cheka</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly leading a rebel group responsible for mass rapes in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A spokesperson for the CEPEHRG said that the nation's largely underground LGBT community is in a <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE76L0KR20110722?sp=true">panic</a> [Reuters report] over recent remarks by <A href = "http://www.parliament.gh/honaidooevans_paul.html">Western Region Minister Paul Evans Aidoo</a> [official profile], who is also a member of parliament. In June, Aidoo <A href = "http://www.ghanatoghana.com/Ghanahomepage/bureau-national-investigations-bni-investigates-homosexuality-western-central-regions">called for investigations</a> [MyJoyOnline report] into homosexuals living in Ghana, stating that Ghana's intelligence agency the Bureau of National Investigations (BNI), the Ghana Health Service and other non-government agencies were working together on the issue. On Wednesday, Aidoo <a href = "http://news.myjoyonline.com/news/201107/69577.asp">suggested that soon the government will be arresting all homosexuals</a> [MyJoyOnline report] via the BNI. Aidoo encouraged landlords to inform on tenants they see engaged in homosexual activity and criticized the <a href = "http://www.ghanaids.gov.gh/gac/index.php">Ghana AIDS Commission</a> (GAC) [advocacy websites] for not revealing the names of approximately 8,000 homosexual men registered with their organization. Homosexuality is currently a misdemeanor under Ghana's criminal code, but several legal professionals in Ghana have opined that the law would not hold if tested in the Supreme Court.

<p>Last month, the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href = "http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4242370.PDF">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF] with a vote of <a href = "http://www.un.org/webcast/unhrc/archive.asp?go=110617">23-19 and 3 abstentions</a> [UN webcast archive].

The rule allowed certain shareholders to have their board nominees listed on company-mailed proxy ballots that also list the management's preferred candidates. Otherwise, the shareholders would incur the costs of mailing out separate ballots. The petitioners, the <a href="http://www.uschamber.com/">US Chamber of Commerce</a> (COC) and the <a href="http://businessroundtable.org/">Business Roundtable</a> [official websites], argued that the SEC failed "adequately to consider the rule's effect upon efficiency, competition, and capital formation" in violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sup_01_5_10_I_30_5_40_II.html">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [5 USC &#167; 551 text]. The three-judge panel agreed, calling the rule "arbitrary, capricious, [and] an abuse of discretion." President and CEO of the COC Thomas Donohue welcomed the court's decision:<blockquote>This is a big win for America's job creators and investors. We applaud the court's decision to prevent special interest politics from being injected into the boardroom. Companies and directors need to continue to focus on the important work of creating jobs and reviving our economy. Today's decision also sends a strong message that regulators need to meet their statutory requirement to clearly prove that the benefits of regulation outweigh the costs.</blockquote>The SEC has failed in this same court to enforce similar laws on three other occasions, though it will now have the opportunity to reevaluate and potentially reissue the rule.

<p>Some investor groups, including labor unions and pension funds, espouse proxy access rules, arguing that such rules <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903554904576461932431478332.html">ensure that company management is held accountable</a> [WSJ report]. Companies, however, contend that proxy access rules give too much power to minority or special interest groups. The SEC was authorized to implement proxy access rules under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> [text, PDF], which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/obama-signs-financial-reform-legislation.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in July 2010 and created the new regulatory council to monitor financial institutions in order to prevent companies from becoming "too big to fail." In addition to creating the US <a href="http://www.treas.gov/FSOC/">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> (FSOC) [offical website], this legislation also gives the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official website] new oversight over the largest financial institutions, creates a bureau of consumer protection, introduces multitudes of new regulations on derivatives and other financial instruments and limits the amount of capital banks can invest in hedge funds. In June 2009, the administration proposed a broad series of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/">regulatory reforms</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-proposes-broad-financial.php">report</a>] aimed at restoring confidence in the US financial system in the wake of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=economic+crisis">economic crisis</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The repeal was also certified by newly sworn-in <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and delivered to Congress. <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14681">Panetta</a> [statement] called the change "essential to the effectiveness of our all-volunteer force."

As Commander in Chief, I have always been confident that our dedicated men and women in uniform would transition to a new policy in an orderly manner that preserves unit cohesion, recruitment, retention and military effectiveness. Today&#8217;s action follows extensive training of our military personnel and certification by Secretary Panetta and Admiral Mullen that our military is ready for repeal. As of September 20th, service members will no longer be forced to hide who they are in order to serve our country. Our military will no longer be deprived of the talents and skills of patriotic Americans just because they happen to be gay or lesbian.</blockquote>The repeal will take effect in 60 days.

Nazul Gul and Adel Hamad were detained at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] for several years, during which they filed petitions for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>, but each was transferred to the custody of other foreign sovereigns before the merits of their petitions were ruled upon. Accordingly, both men remained designated as "enemy combatants," a label which they claim has resulted in collateral consequences that continue to burden them. Gul and Hamad argue that the harm they suffer from their status as "enemy combatants" is sufficient to warrant a judicial remedy. The court rejected this argument however, as each of the harms alleged was either unable to be redressed by the court or too speculative to sustain the exercise of federal jurisdiction. Judge Douglas Ginsburg, discussing one of the alleged harms, wrote:<blockquote>Gul and Hamad next argue that because they are designated enemy combatants, the United States does not consider them "civilians"; and, therefore, under the laws of war, it may recapture, again detain, and even kill them. This claim of injury is the most speculative of all: The appellants apparently have no basis whatsoever for believing the Government might pursue them because of their continuing designation (or for that matter, any other reason). Indeed, the Government no longer attaches any legal significance to the term "enemy combatant."</blockquote>The court's ruling affirmed that of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], which had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-dismisses-105-former.php">dismissed as moot</a> [JURIST report] 105 <em>habeas</em> petitions of non-citizen former detainees who are no longer in US custody. Friday's decision affects the status of those individuals as well.

<p>Earlier this month, an EU official told the <em>Miami Herald</em> that Europe is still <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/eu-still-open-to-receiving-guantanamo-detainees-report.php">willing to resettle</a> [JURIST report] Guantanamo detainees despite Congress' efforts to prevent closure and transfers. In a display of commitment to a <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/eu-and-us-agree-on-guantanamo-detainee.php">2009 agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the US, the EU reiterated that detainees would still be accepted on a case-by-case basis. So far, 27 detainees have been transferred to European countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/two-ex-guantanamo-detainees-arrve-in-germany.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a> [JURIST reports]. With 171 detainees left at Guantanamo, the EU's support of transferring detainees comes just weeks after US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ag-holder-defends-prosecuting-terror-suspects-in-civilian-courts.php">defended his plans</a> [JURIST report] to prosecute terror suspects in federal civilian courts, responding to harsh criticism from Senate Minority Leader <a href="http://mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Home">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) [official website] urging two Iraqi-born terror suspects in Kentucky be sent to Guantanamo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chief Judge Michael Davis of the <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/index.shtml">US District Court for the District of Minnesota</a> [official website] described the court as "intimately familiar" with the case against Jammie Thomas-Rasset, as it has presided over three trials on the matter. In granting Thomas-Rasset's Motion to Amend or Alter the Judgment, Davis emphasized the fact that she is a "first-time willful, consumer infringer of limited means who committed illegal song file-sharing for her own personal use." Accordingly, Davis found the award of $1.5 million to the plaintiffs, members of the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) [trade website], "appalling" and inconsistent with due process. Instead, RIAA will be awarded $2,250 for each of the 24 songs Thomas-Rasset was found to have illegally shared. 

<p>The $1.5 million jury verdict against Thomas-Rasset was handed down in November 2010, during a third trial requested by RIAA based solely on the issue of damages. This request came after an order from Davis in January 2010, to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-reduces-192-million-jury.php">reduce</a> [JURIST report] a $1.92 million jury verdict against Thomas-Rasset to about $54,000. The $1.9 million verdict stemmed from a trial in June 2009, in which a federal jury in Minnesota <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-jury-assesses-192-million.php">assessed damages</a> [JURIST report] at $80,000 per song. The jury found her to have willfully violated copyright law by sharing songs on KaZaA, which has since become a legitimate music purveyor. Those proceedings against Thomas-Rasset were a retrial of a previous judgment against her, <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/federal-judge-grants-woman-new-trial-on.php">granted by a federal judge</a> on the grounds that the court erred by instructing the jury that making the music available on the KaZaA network was enough to violate the Copyright Act and that the <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/recording-labels-win-first-illegal-file.php">$222,000 in damages</a> [JURIST reports] was excessive. In 2008, the RIAA said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/riaa-abandons-lawsuits-for-filesharing.php">discontinue its controversial policy</a> [JURIST report] of suing suspected file-sharers and instead will seek cooperation with major Internet service providers to cut off access to repeat offenders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court effectively reiterated its order <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] last week, in which it reinstated DADT, but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy. Hours earlier, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] and the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/dadtcert.pdf">certified</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-certifies-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">report</a>] DADT's repeal, scheduling the policy to end September 20. The order allows the court to continue its consideration of the issues concerning the policy's complete repeal.

<p>Last week's order followed an emergency motion made by the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-administration-asks-appeals-court-to-reinstate-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">asking the court to reinstate DADT</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the Ninth Circuit's decision earlier in the month to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-immediate-end-to-enforcement-of-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">order a stop to the policy</a> [JURIST report] was misguided and would hinder the repeal process already underway. In November, the court issued the original <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ninth-circuit-indefinitely-extends-stay-on-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">stay</a> [JURIST report] suspending enforcement of the injunction against DADT. The government had requested that the litigation be placed on hold in light of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">passage of legislation to repeal the policy</a> [JURIST report]. After hearing seven months of arguments and briefs, the Ninth Circuit rejected that appeal and lifted the stay. Since DADT's 1993 enactment, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

They also called on Syria to grant UN officials access in order to conduct humanitarian and investigatory missions, saying:<blockquote>Based on available information, the Special Advisers consider that the scale and gravity of the violations indicate a serious possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed and continue to be committed in Syria. They underline the need for an independent, thorough, and objective investigation of the events in the country. They call on the Government of Syria, as the Secretary-General has done, to allow humanitarian access to affect areas and to facilitate the visit of the Human Rights Council-mandated fact finding mission so that it can complete its work. Without these steps, it will be very difficult to defuse existing tensions and to prevent the escalation of violence.</blockquote>The statement comes as violence in the country continues, and some allege that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gElphbz_6QETKSR-aLtbSYj5dWPg?docId=CNG.fe768764ef7d83a788e89cdd526cf0de.351">official misconduct has intensified</a> [AFP report] in the days immediately prior to Ramadan beginning on August 1.

<p>There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/029/2011/en/9eec5cc2-4712-411b-b24e-32852cb7bad7/mde240292011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ai-report-syria-security-forces-may-have-committed-crimes-against-humanity.php">report</a>] documenting alleged crimes against humanity during an operation to suppress demonstrations, including killings, mass arrests, arbitrary detentions and torture. In June, Syrian and international human rights groups urged the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the hundreds of civilian deaths during protests against Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile].

The bill <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38000447/ns/world_news-asiapacific">passed</a> [AP report] in the <a href="http://korea.na.go.kr/index.jsp">National Assembly</a> [official website] last year 137-13 with 140 legislators declining to cast a vote. According to an anonymous ministry official, "The law takes effect immediately," and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43870883/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/">dozens of convicted sex offenders could be sentenced</a> [Reuters report] to chemical castration under the legislation this year alone. South Korea is the first Asian country to enact the controversial legislation. 

<p>The chemical castration process consists of a series of chemical injections that hinder the effects of the male hormone testosterone. Other countries have considered enacting similar legislation. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">Russian President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-lawmakers-considering-chemical-castration-bill.php">proposed a bill</a> [JURIST report] calling for, among other penalties, chemical castration of individuals convicted of sexual offenses against children. In the US, several individual states have enacted legislation allowing for chemical castration of convicted sex offenders including <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=52094027473+5+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve">California</a> [materials], <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&SubMenu=1&App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=794.0235&URL=0700-0799/0794/Sections/0794.0235.html">Florida</a> [materials] and <a href="http://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm?md=newsroom&tmp=detail&articleID=270">Louisiana</a> [materials].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure was initially passed by the Belgian Federal Parliament in April 2010 by a vote of 136-1. Under the new legislation, any woman who wears a burqa in public faces the <a href="http://abna.ir/data.asp?lang=3&id=255306">possibility of a fine or up to seven days in jail</a> [ABNA report]. Opponents of the controversial law allege that such a ban is discriminatory against Muslims and that a ban violates human rights. The <a href="http://www.coe.int/lportal/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> [official website] commissioner of human rights <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/about/biohammarberg_en.asp">Thomas Hammarberg</a> [backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-it-is-more-likely.php">denounced the legislation</a> [JURIST report] in a written <a href="http://commissioner.cws.coe.int/tiki-view_blog_post.php?postId=157">comment</a> [text] stating "In fact, the banning may run counter to European human rights standards, in particular the right to respect for one's private life and personal identity." A court challenge has been launched by two women who wear burqas charging that the measure is a violation of religious freedom. 

<p>Belgium is not the first EU country to enact legislation banning the wearing of full face veils in public. In April, France <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-burqa-ban-to-take-effect-april-11.php">enacted</a> [JURIST report] a law similar to that of Belgium after its <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/homepage.14.html">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ruled</a> the legislation was constitutional [JURIST report]. Under the French law, violators wearing a face covering may be fined up to 150 euros and/or required to attend citizenship classes. In contrast, anyone convicted of forcing a woman to cover her face may be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEgiMW33brZhPohZrPSXS_zbE8lQ?docId=CNG.454c1042a774374e5f29a46c701d14b2.7b1">fined up to 30,000 euro and jailed for one year</a> [AFP report, in French], and the penalties double if that woman is a minor. The French ban is not exclusive to the burqa, <a href="http://www.metro.co.uk/news/857159-france-burka-ban-set-for-april">prohibiting any covering of the face in a public place</a> [Metro report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Public Safety Minister Vic Toews and Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism Jason Kenney announced and released a <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/wc-cg/menu-eng.html">list of the 30 alleged war criminals</a> [materials] suspected to be hiding in Canada, including the men's photos, birthdates and other information. The list was posted on the website of the <a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html">Canada Border Services Agency</a> (CBSA) [official website], and the public responded. Just one day after the announcement, the Canadian public's tips led to the separate arrests of two men, Arshad Muhammad of Pakistan, and former Honduran soldier Cristobal Gonzalez-Ramirez. Each had evaded arrest for several years and was found in Canada as a direct result of public tips. Toews <a href="http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/media/nr/2011/nr20110723-eng.aspx?rss=false">said</a> [press release] Saturday:<blockquote>The help that Canadians are providing to Canada Border Services is proving to be beyond what we had expected. ... Those who have been involved in war crimes or crimes against humanity will find no haven on our shores; they will be located, and they will face the consequences.</blockquote>The ministers also thanked the public for their assistance and reminded them that all that members of the public should report tips to the CBSA or police, and not take action to apprehend the individuals listed on the website.

<p>In 2000 Canada ratified its <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/C-45.9.pdf">Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act</a> [text, PDF] "respecting genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and to implement the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</a> [materials], and to make consequential amendments to other Acts." The Act provides universal jurisdiction for war crimes and crimes against humanity. This allows the Canadian government to prosecute any person who committed an applicable offense 1) if at the time of the offense either the offender or the victim was a citizen of either Canada or its ally in an armed conflict, or 2) if after the the time of the offense the person is present in Canada. The first person convicted under the Act was Rwandan Hutu <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/673.html">Desire Munyaneza</a> [The Hague Justice Portal profile], who was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/rwandan-hutu-first-to-be-convicted.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 of seven counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder], and was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/canada-court-sentences-rwanda-war.php">life imprisonment</a> [JURIST report]. A second Rwandan genocide suspect, <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/11/980.html">Jacques Mungwarere</a> [The Hague Justice Portal profile], was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/canada-prosecutors-charge-second-rwanda.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] later that year and was indicted under the Act in May 2010 for war crimes, crimes against humanity and two counts of genocide. He has not yet stood trial, but his indictment was filed under section 577 of the Canadian Criminal Code, which can permit a case to be sent straight to trial without a preliminary inquiry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bahraini authorities have promised that the commission will have access to government files and will be permitted to interview witnesses without supervision.

Thirty-three people died during the unrest and more than 400 were injured. The commission is scheduled to publish the results of the investigation by October 30. 

<p>Bahrain, along with several other Middle Eastern and North African nations, has faced criticism from international human rights organizations for its handling of pro-reform protests in recent months. In May, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said the government of Bahrain should suspend prosecution of civilians in military courts and set up an <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">impartial commission to investigate torture allegations</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged the government of Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters. She expressed concern over the prosecution of medical professionals and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">death sentences</a> [JURIST report] handed to four activists.

The law would <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/07/25/3034670/syria-endorses-law-to-allow-political.html">permit a political party to be established</a> [AP report] so long as it is not based on religious or tribal lines and does not discriminate based on ethnicity, gender or race. Though the draft law, along with other concessions made by al-Assad, is a step toward the reform demanded, protestors seek an end to Article 8 of the Syrian <a href="http://www.mideastinfo.com/documents/Syria_Constitution.htm">Constitution</a> [text], which declares the Baath Party leader of the state and society. The bill will likely be presented for debate on August 7, and Parliament must approve the law before it is enacted. 

<p>Al-Assad spoke at Damascus University in June where he announced that he would soon <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/syria-president-promises-reform-alleges-conspiracy.php">introduce reforms and present a new constitution</a> [JURIST report], but he spent much of the speech claiming that the protests were part of a conspiracy against Syria. He contends that a group of terrorists is responsible for the vandalism, robberies and murders that have taken place since protests erupted in the country early this year and said that he planned to prosecute and hold those individuals accountable. Earlier in June, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/syria-president-grants-amnesty-for-political-prisoners.php">granted amnesty to political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] including all members of the previously banned <a http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/92456/obama-ohio-romney-bachmann-palinhref="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/articles.php?pid=10005">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [party website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">news archive</a>], but opposition leaders dismissed the move and met in Turkey to discuss Syria's future. Syria has come under international scrutiny for using force to suppress the protests across the country. The UN has expressed concern over violence in Syria and urged the Syrian government to stop using force against protesters.

In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt.

Hadzic was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hadzic-extradited-to-hague-to-face-icty.php">extradited to The Hague</a> [JURIST report] last Friday, where he now awaits trial for <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/hadzic/ind/en/had-ii040716e.htm">war crimes</a> [indictment text]. Hadzic was the last fugitive of the original 161 sought by the ICTY and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">arrested last week</a> [JURIST report]. Hadzic waived his right to appeal extradition and, after visiting with a few relatives in Serbia, was flown to The Hague. The court has not set any dates for further appearances. There has been international praise for Hadzic's arrest. Earlier last week, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5425">commended</a> [text] President Tadic and the Serbian authorities "for their leadership in ending impunity for those indicted for serious violations of international humanitarian law."

<p><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HdP3FPtjD5k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Hadzic was a key player in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] and has been at large for approximately seven years. Hadzic's <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/hadzic/cis/en/cis_hadzic_en.pdf">official charges</a> [case information sheet, PDF] are: persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; extermination; murder; torture; inhumane acts; deportation and forcible transfer; cruel treatment; wanton destruction of villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity; destruction or willful damage done to institutions dedicated to education and religion; and plunder of public or private property. Hadzic's indictment contends that, in his role as president of the Serbian nationalist forces during the war, he attempted to permanently and forcibly remove a majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from the disputed territory. He is accused of murdering or ordering the murders of hundreds of non-Serb citizens, including children and the elderly. Further, he allegedly displaced more than 20,000 non-Serb civilians. Hadzic was found near the small Serbian village of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&amp;mm=07&amp;dd=20&amp;nav_id=75543">Krusedol</a> [B92 report], living under a false name. Although he was armed, he did not resist arrest. He was discovered after attempting to sell a painting by Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, in order to obtain funds to facilitate his hiding. Hadzic was also reportedly harbored by members of the <a href="http://www.spc.rs/eng">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> (SPC) [official website].

The plaintiffs argue, among other claims, that the law was enacted in violation of the New York State <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/coog/openmeetlaw.html">Open Meetings Laws</a> [text], that the Senate failed to follow voting procedures and that the Senate conducted lock-outs that denied access to lobbyists and elected representatives. Executive Director at NYCF Rev. Jason McGuire contends that the courts must ensure the lawmakers were not acting unlawfully:<blockquote>Constitutional liberties were violated. Today we are asking the court to intervene in its rightful role as the check and balance on an out-of-control State Legislature. It is unfortunate that state senators chose to protect their personal interests, rather than the people they were elected to represent. Some of the players may have changed, but it looks like same old Albany game. It is time the curtain be pulled back and the disinfecting light of good government shine upon the Cuomo Administration and our State Legislature.</blockquote>The plaintiffs are seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.

<p>The challenge comes just one day after New York began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples and one month after New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">signed the legislation</a> into law. The New York State Assembly had passed same-sex marriage bills before in <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/new-york-assembly-passes-spitzer-gay.php">2007</a> and in <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/new-york-state-assembly-approves-same.php">2009</a>, but the bills were <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-york-senate-rejects-same-sex.php">unable to pass the Senate</a> [JURIST reports]. Before the passage of the Marriage Equality Act, New York recognized same-sex marriages performed in other states. Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/">New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/new-york-appeals-court-allows-surviving-same-sex-spouse-to-inherit-estate.php">upheld</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-surviving.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST reports] allowing the surviving spouse of a same-sex marriage legally performed in Canada to inherit the deceased spouse's estate. With the legislation, New York becomes the seventh US jurisdiction to allow same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is also legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdna.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/094718p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 8-6 that law enforcement officers are permitted to obtain DNA samples from arrestees. Law enforcement officers sought a DNA sample from defendant Ruben Mitchell after he was indicted for attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00014135---a000-.html">42 USC &#167; 14135a(a)(1)(A)</a> [text], which permits the collection of DNA samples from individuals who are arrested, facing charges or convicted. Mitchell argued that the DNA collection violated his <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] right against unreasonable searches and seizures. The district court agreed, ruling that the DNA collection was unconstitutional. Though the government is permitted to appeal a criminal order in few circumstances, the court permitted the government to appeal the trial court's holding on the grounds that the district court conclusively decided a question of constitutional law and because the ruling resolved an important issue independent from the merits of the action. The appeals court overruled the lower court's decision, concluding that because arrestees have a diminished expectation of privacy, the government's interest in collecting and testing the DNA sample outweighed the intrusion on Mitchell's privacy. The court pointed to the government's compelling interest in identifying suspects and the unique attributes of DNA evidence to reach its conclusion.

<p>US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] instructed federal prosecutors in 2010 to use DNA evidence as much as possible and <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/holder-calls-for-increased-use-of-dna-evidence.php">collect DNA evidence from all federal arrestees</a> [JURIST report], in a reversal of Bush administration policy. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/mandatory.dna.testing.edca.opinion.052809.pdf">upheld the constitutionality</a> [opinion, PDF] of mandatory DNA collection for all persons arrested or detained under federal authority, holding that although the collection of DNA from those arrested on federal felony, sexual abuse, or violent crime charges does constitute a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, a person arrested based on probable cause "has a diminished expectation of privacy in his own identity." Federal agencies <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-expanding-dna-data-collection-to-all.php">began collecting DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009, although they had been authorized to do so since 2006. About 1.2 million additional people could be added to the FBI's <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/clickmap.htm">Combined DNA Indexing System</a> (CODIS) [official website; FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/codis_brochure">backgrounder</a>] every year under the expansion, although people who are not convicted can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/16/AR2008041602729.html?hpid=topnews">request the destruction</a> [WP report] of their DNA samples. In November 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dna.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that all convicted federal felons must provide DNA samples to a federal database available to police departments throughout the country. In 2005, the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/appeals-court-upholds.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a convicted bank robber had to submit DNA samples to CODIS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.parlament.mt/home">Malta House of Representatives</a> [official website] overwhelmingly <a href="http://www.newser.com/story/124236/divorce-finally-allowed-in-malta.html">passed the bill</a> [AP report] with 52 votes in favor, 11 against with five abstentions, in a country where most laws are passed by one vote. The bill will take effect in October after it is expected to be signed by the Maltese president. The vote reflects the result of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/malta-votes-to-legalize-divorce.php">public referendum</a> [JURIST report] on the issue held last May in which the public voted in favor of legalizing divorce with 53 percent of the vote. However, the referendum only reflected 72 percent of eligible voters in one of the lowest turnouts in recent history. Malta does allow for court-ordered separations and residents can apply for an annulment with the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm">Roman Catholic Church</a> [official website]. Malta also recognized foreign divorces, a route which many Maltese couples took in order to obtain a divorce. Malta is the last EU nation not to allow divorce.

<p>Proponents of legalizing divorce argued that it was necessary to reduce the influence of the church in Maltese government and to respect civil rights. Opponents argued that it would encourage the breakup of families and increase separation rates. The change will leave Vatican City and the Philippines the last two countries in with the world that do not allow divorce. Chile was the last country to transition to legalized divorce in 2004 when its <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/chile-grants-first-legal-divorce.php">new marital code went into effect</a> [JURIST report], replacing the code that had been in force since 1884. The new Chilean law permits divorce in the case of breach of marital duties, such as infidelity or domestic violence, or after a period of separation whose length depends on whether one party or both wish to end the marriage. Malta's vote comes a year after the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] proposed reforms to simplify and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/eu-proposes-simplified-international.php">clarify international divorce laws</a> [JURIST report]. Under the proposal, married couples from different EU countries could choose the country of the divorce, and the various courts would use a common formula to decide which country's law applies when a couple disagrees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, Blagojevich was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-convicted-on-corruption-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] by a jury in the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] on 17 of counts including attempting to sell the Senate seat. He <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-blagojevich-asks-for-new-trial-cites-judicial-error-20110726,0,350836.story">claims</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] that his previous trial was subject to judicial bias and error that undermined his case. The motion, while asserting that the court operated with a "closed mind," criticizes U.S. District Judge James Zagel of not giving proper respect to Blagojevich's testimony after assuring the defense that the testimony would be valued in the case. Blagojevich is <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59908.html">currently out on $450,000 bail</a> [<em>Politico</em> report] and faces up to decades in prison. The court is expected to respond to the motion sometime next month.

<p>The jury that convicted Blagojevich <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-blagojevich-jurors-going-into-their-10th-day-20110627,0,620170.story">remained deadlocked</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] on a charge of attempted extortion for solicitation of then-congressman Rahm Emanuel, who served as President Obama's chief of staff before being elected mayor of Chicago. Blagojevich was previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] last year of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on 23 additional charges. The prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dropped some of the charges</a> [JURIST report] to simplify the case for retrial including charges for racketeering. Prosecutors also dropped charges against Blagojevich's brother, his chief fundraiser. Blagojevich had tried to avoid the second trial in March, but Judge Zagel <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-declines-to-rule-on-blagojevich-cancel-trial-request.php">declined to formally rule</a> on his <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/blagojevich-asks-judge-to-cancel-retrial.php">request to cancel the trial</a> [JURIST reports], saying that the motion was neither serious nor did it raise a legal question.

Carlos Antonio Carias, Manuel Pop, Reyes Collin and Daniel Martinez are <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14285665">accused</a> [BBC report] of being members of a military force that allegedly killed more than 250 people in the town of Dos Erres in 1982 during the country's <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/guatemala.htm">36-year civil war</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. Three of the men were members of a special forces unit known as the Kaibiles, at least part of which is alleged to have played a role in the massacre. The military force was attempting to rout out insurgents during Guatemala's military rule under General Efrain Rios Montt. The four men pleaded not guilty arguing that they were not stationed with the group that carried out the atrocities at Dos Erres. They are accused of killing 201 farmers. There are also <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/07/25/international/i173138D07.DTL">allegations</a> [AP report] that many women and girls in Dos Erres were raped and killed during the massacre. The Guatemalan civil war resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala's large indigenous Mayan population. According to a UN report released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths.

<p>Earlier this month, the UN said it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-applauds-arrest-of-guatemala-genocide-suspect.php">approved of the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of a former top Guatemalan military figure accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. General Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes, former chief of staff of Guatemalan armed forces from 1982-1983, is accused of directing military attacks against citizens, namely indigenous Mayans. Villages were destroyed and women and girls were systematically raped under his authorization. In response many deaths during the civil war, the Guatemalan government founded the National Compensation Program (PNR) in 2003 to deal with claims by civilians affected by the civil war. The PNR, after setting up its administrative structure, has begun to use its $40 million budget to work through a backlog of more than 98,000 civilian complaints. More than 1,000 complaints were filed in 2008. The PNR hopes to file the majority of the complaints within the next year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The cross, two intersecting beams found in the wreckage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, was <a href="http://www.911memorial.org/blog/wtc-cross-installed-911-memorial-museum-updated">moved</a> [9/11 Memorial report] to the <a href="http://www.911memorial.org/">9/11 Memorial Museum</a> [official website] last week from a nearby church amid communion and a blessing from a priest. AA, however, <a href="http://atheists.org/press_releases/atheists_file_suit_to_block_wtc_memoiral_cross">views the cross</a> [press release] as a "Christian icon" and contends that Christianity does not deserve "preferential treatment." AA President Dave Silverman called for a more inclusive memorial display:<blockquote>This cross is now a part of the official WTC memorial. No other religions or philosophies will be honored. It will just be a Christian icon, in the middle of OUR memorial. As a public accommodation, the memorial must allow us (and all other religious philosophies) to include our own display of equal size inside the museum, or not include the cross. Equality is an all-or-nothing deal.</blockquote>AA claims the cross violates New York law and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a> Amendments to the US Constitution. New York <a href="http://mikebloomberg.com/">Mayor Michael Bloomberg</a> and New Jersey <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official websites] are named among the defendants.

<p>Courts have disagreed on the constitutionality of religious displays. Most recently, a federal judge <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/pdfs/2011-07-ACLU-DixieJudgement.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] Florida's Dixie County Courthouse to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-rules-florida-courthouse-must-remove-ten-commandments-monument.php">remove</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/images/Dixie10C-1.jpg">Ten Commandments monument</a> [JPG] displayed on the front steps of the courthouse because the display violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the First Amendment to the US Constitution. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] in February <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0029p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sixth-circuit-rules-against-ten-commandments-in-ohio-courthouse.php">barring the Ten Commandments</a> [JURIST report] from being displayed in an Ohio courthouse. In January, a three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/01/04/08-56415.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously that California's Mount Soledad cross, a 43-foot cross erected as a Korean War veterans' memorial, is unconstitutional under the First Amendment. The Sixth Circuit in June 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sixth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-ten-commandments-in-kentucky-courthouses.php">upheld an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Ten Commandment displays in two Kentucky courthouses, finding that the displays represented simply another strategy "in a long line of attempts" to comply with the Constitution for litigation purposes and did not "minimize the residue of religious purpose." A month earlier, the same court denied an <em>en banc</em> rehearing in <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0006p-06.pdf">another case</a> [opinion, PDF] involving the display of the Ten Commandments in a Grayson County, Kentucky, courthouse. The court found the display to be constitutional because it presented a valid secular purpose from the outset. <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/tenth-circuit-finds-memorial-crosses-along-highways-unconstitutional.php">Highway memorial crosses</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-christian-themed.php">crosses on license plates</a>  [JURIST reports] have also been found unconstitutional by federal courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/procedural-law/criminal-procedure-law/special-procedures/318-anti-terrorism-proclamation-no-6522009.html">Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ethiopia-lawmakers-pass-controversial.php">report</a>] provides for penalties of 10 to 20 years in prison for publishing statements "likely to be understood as encouraging terrorist acts." In July, an Ethiopian court used the law to justify the prolonged detention, without charge, of two journalists accused of conspiracy to commit terrorism. Deputy Africa Director of HRW Rona Peligal urged the Ethiopian government to reject the law:<blockquote>The Ethiopian government should not rely on an overly broad anti-terrorism law to silence independent reporting in Ethiopia. It should either bring credible charges against the two journalists or quickly release them. Every detainee in Ethiopia should be granted immediate access to counsel and to their families. Accusations under the terrorism law should never mean the denial of basic human rights.</blockquote>Though Ethiopia's <a href="http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Hornet/Ethiopian_Constitution.html">Constitution</a> [text] requires that a detainee have the opportunity to appear in court within 48 hours of detention, the Act extends that time limit to four 28-day periods, or up to four months. HRW also reported that torture is frequent at Ethiopian detention facilities and arrestees are often held without access to legal counsel, thereby intensifying the effects of the law.

<p>Human rights in Ethiopia have been intensely scrutinized by the international community. HRW published a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/84132">report</a> [text] shortly after Ethiopia enacted the law, expressing concern that the law could "punish political speech and peaceful protest as terrorist acts and encourage unfair trials." The <a href="http://www.enpcp.org/Who_we_are.htm">Ethiopian National Priorities Consultative Process</a> [advocacy website] met in July 2009 to agree on a <a href="http://www.abbaymedia.com/pdf/ENPCP_Chicago_Conference_Resolution.pdf">resolution</a> [text, PDF] that expresses concern over civil rights. The group was troubled by proclamations being passed by the ruling regime, calling anti-terrorism laws and others "draconian" and repressive. In January of that same year, the Ethiopian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/ethiopia-parliament-approves.php">adopted legislation</a> [JURIST report] to prevent certain foreign charities from being involved in areas that the government believes are internal affairs including human rights and equality. In June 2008, HRW released a report attacking Ethiopian <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ethiopia-ethnic-separatists-targets-of.php">human rights practices in the Ogaden region</a> [JURIST report]. The US House of Representatives passed the <a href="/forumy/2008/01/linking-rights-and-foreign-aid-for.php">Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007</a> [JURIST op-ed], aimed in part at encouraging the improvement of the human rights situation in Ethiopia, but the bill never became law. In July 2007, HRW accused Ethiopian troops of <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/ethiopia-military-crackdown-on-rebels.php">violating international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST report] by burning homes and forcibly relocating civilians in Ogaden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban was satisfied with positive developments made in the meeting with Suu Kyi and the Minister for Social Welfare U Aung Kyi. Suu Kyi recently called on the international community to help improve workers' rights in an address to the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization</a> (ILO) [official website] at its annual conference. She said the workers rights linked to the prisoner situation in Myanmar. Ban's spokesman said: <blockquote>The Secretary-General encourages such contacts and dialogue. It will be recalled that his Special Adviser, had meetings with [Suu Kyi and Aung Kyi] during his recent visit to Myanmar. In line with the international community's expectations and Myanmar's national interest, the Secretary-General hopes such efforts will continue with a view to building mutual understanding through genuine dialogue. He also calls upon the Government of Myanmar to consider early action on the release of political prisoners in that country.</blockquote> Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">underwent a transfer of power</a> [BBC report] from a military regime to a civil system after holding its first elections in 20 years. But many critics argue the new regime is a sham since a party close to the military regime won with 80 percent of the vote. Last November, Myanmar's government released Suu Kyi, ending her almost eight years under house arrest. 

<p>Last month, Myanmar began releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners as part of an amnesty program after a visit by the UN secretary-general's envoy to Myanmar, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=117">Vijay Nambiar</a> [official profile], who called on the country to release its political prisoners. But few of the prisoners being released by the government are political prisoners. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called the move a "pathetic response" to calls from the international community. Last December, a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] expert <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tomas+ojea+quintana">news archive</a>], a UN Special Rapporteur, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">urged Myanmar's military government</a> [JURIST report] to release 2,202 political prisoners. Quintana called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," many of whom, he says, suffer from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy. Ban hailed Suu Kyi's release and encouraged the country to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4924">release all political prisoners</a> [press release]. Suu Kyi's release came days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The council also called upon the CAR government "to work to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of all children associated with these groups, and to refuse any support for any militias that recruit and use children." Also, in advocating the cooperation of armed groups with the UN, the council welcomed a <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,CAF,456d621e2,4dfef3542,0.html">ceasefire last month</a> [UN Refugee Agency report] by the CPJP with the CAR government.

<p>The council's expressed concern comes days after the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] itself <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10335.doc.htm">condemned</a> [press release] the LRA for ongoing attacks in central Africa and called for the release of all civilians and non-combatants including child soldiers. The security council has also requested an official report on the LRA to be submitted in October. In addition, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/war-crimes-affecting-somalia-children-ai.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report last week about children as victims of war crimes in Somalia. In the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR52/001/2011/en/2b90b425-0742-4c83-87f0-e8fd0b6baa51/afr520012011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "In the Line of Fire: Somalia's Children Under Attack," AI provided evidence indicating that armed conflict in areas of Somalia has led to deteriorating human rights conditions, particularly for children. Armed military and civilian forces, like the Islamic terrorist group <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/18650/">al-Shabaab</a> [CFR backgrounder], regularly recruit Somalian children to serve as soldiers, often denying access to education and placing the children in danger of death and injury. The report contained vignettes illustrating the impact of fighting outbreaks on Somali youth. AI also enumerated recommendations for protecting children, including the monitoring military recruitment more effectively, initiation of investigations and cooperation with international human rights organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The groups said that making sure the Syrian people receive restitution for the assets stolen by corrupt leaders is a fundamental part of the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/Publications/Convention/08-50026_E.pdf">UN Convention Against Corruption</a> [text, PDF; UNODC <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html">backgrounder</a>]. They complain that the current asset freeze by the EU does not cover assets held for al-Assad by others in a possible corruption conspiracy. The group pointed to similar complaints against former Tunisian president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] and Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] that have led to criminal investigations for allegations of money laundering. 

<p>Syria has been struggling to reform amidst widespread protests, and al-Assad has come under international scrutiny for using force to control demonstrators. Earlier this week, a <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] spokesman <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gwCQfBwsVtKr3GzGniaIifXcngQw?docId=CNG.643344498e2f2a59f170cf3592a94df0.1141">called the Syrian response "barbaric"</a> [AFP report], while <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hilary Clinton</a> [official profile] said the al-Assad had lost legitimacy. Last week, two UN rights officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over reports of violence used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people. Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide <a href="http://www.unelections.org/files/IGP_BiographyofFrancisDeng_30May07.pdf">Francis Deng</a> [official profile, PDF] and Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect <a href="http://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/directory/ecl2002-fac.html">Edward Luck</a> [academic profile] stated that reports of Syrian forces killing or arbitrarily arresting peaceful protesters indicate potentially grievous violations of international human rights laws, and urged officials to adhere to the government's 2005 pledge to protect its citizens. On Sunday, the Syrian government <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/syria-law-to-allow-political-party-formation.php">approved a draft law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow the formation of political parties to oppose the ruling Baath Party, led by al-Assad, that would permit a political party to be established so long as it is not based on religious or tribunal lines and does not discriminate based on ethnicity, gender or race. Critics say al-Assad has achieved little reform despite <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/syria-president-promises-reform-alleges-conspiracy.php">promises</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The president and governors are currently limited to serving two four-year terms and are permitted to run for re-election between terms. Jonathan cited the high cost of organizing party primaries and general elections and the instability that regularly follows elections as reasons for proposing the amendment. Jonathan has not, however, provided any details about the length of the proposed extended term. A spokesperson for the president describes the proposed amendment as an effort to facilitate democracy:<blockquote>President Jonathan's commitment to a single term for the President and Governors is borne out of a patriotic zeal, after a painstaking study and belief that the constitutionally guaranteed two terms for Presidents and Governors is not helping the focus of Governance and institutionalization of democracy at this stage of our development. A longer term for lawmakers would also help to stabilise the polity.</blockquote>The proposed amendment will be sent to the <a href="http://www.nassnig.org/">National Assembly</a> (NASS) [official website] for discussion and voting. If approved, the bill would not take effect until 2015, after Jonathan's presidential term has ended.

<p>Nigerian elections have not proceeded without significant problems. In March, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.nba.org.ng/">Nigerian Bar Association</a> [association website] called for Nigeria's National Assembly to pass legislation <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/13/nigeria-pass-bill-prosecute-electoral-abuses">creating a special electoral offenses commission</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/nigeria-legislature-urged-to-create-special-electoral-offences-commission.php">report</a>]. The commission would be tasked with investigating and prosecuting election-related abuses, including violence. In November, a judge for Nigeria's <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/High%20Courts.htm">Federal High Court</a> [official website] in Lagos <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/nigeria-court-rules-national-assembly-amendments-cannot-become-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an amendment to the 1999 Nigerian <a href="http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm">Constitution</a> [text] made by NASS cannot become operational law without the assent of the president. The amendment, known as the <a target="_blank" href="http://placng.org/gazzette%20of%20the%20electoral%20act.pdf">Constitution (First Amendment) Act 2010</a> [text, PDF] was passed in June 2010. It repeals the Independent National Electoral Commission Act 2006 in order to re-instate the Nigerian <a href="http://www.inecnigeria.org/">Independent National Election Commission</a> (INEC) [official website]. Also in June 2010, the legislature <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nigeria-senate-passes-revisions-clarifying-presidential-succession.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] revisions to the constitution to clarify the exercise of executive authority in absence of the president. The constitutional revisions changed federal election law by removing a provision of the constitution that prohibited people who had been charged with fraud from standing for election and required candidates for federal office to have a degree beyond secondary education. Previous elections in Nigeria have been marred by <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-state-elections-marred-by.php">violence</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">fraud</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

With a <a href="http://www.news-record.com/content/2011/07/26/article/house_votes_to_over_abortion_bill_veto">72-47 vote</a> [<em>News-Record</em> report], the measure, known as the "Women's Right to Know Act," will now go to the Senate, which on Monday <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2011/07/26/2481655/house-overrides-3-perdue-vetoes.html">overrode</a> [<em>Charlotte Observer</em> report] three additional Perdue vetoes. The abortion legislation would also require women seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound of the fetus prior to the procedure. Supporters argue that the bill is necessary in order for women to be fully informed about their decision, but Perdue <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/NewsItems/PressReleaseDetail.aspx?newsItemID=1899">disagrees</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">report</a>], calling it "a dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors." The legislation had originally passed the House 71-48 and the Senate 29-20.

<p>The North Carolina government is one of several state legislatures to have acted recently to limit abortion rights. Both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-govenor-signs-bill-restricting-access-to-abortions.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] have recently passed bills requiring ultrasounds before abortions. Last month, the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">lawsuit challenging the Texas law</a> [JURIST report]. In March, South Dakota passed a law requiring a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">three-day waiting period</a> [JURIST report] before an abortion&#8212;the longest waiting period in the country. That law is also facing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">court challenge</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kireyev made his decision based on his ability to control his courtroom, although he stated that Tymoshenko had disrespected him by not standing when addressing the court and that her supporters were causing distracting disturbances by protesting her trial. Tymoshenko said that Kireyev did not arrest her <a href = "http://twitter.com/#!/YuliaTymoshenko/status/96172893985193984">out of fear</a> [tweet]. Tymoshenko's <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-goes-on-trial-for-abuse-of-power.php">ongoing trial</a> includes charges of <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ukraine-ex-prime-minister-charged-with-abuse-of-office.php">abuse of office</a> in connection with signing gas import contracts with Russia, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ukraine-prosecutors-charge-ex-pm-tymoshenko-with-misusing-state-funds.php">misappropriating state funds</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ukraine-prosecutors-launch-new-investigation-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">abuse of authority</a> [JURIST reports] by purchasing "1000 Opel Combo" medical vans at a 20 percent mark-up during her time as prime minister from 2007-2010. Last week, the court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-court-dismisses-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-defense-attorney.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Serhiy Vlasenko, Tymoshenko's lawyer. In protest, Tymoshenko <a href = "http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/109479/">appeared without lawyers</a> [Interfax-Ukraine report] Wednesday and filed a motion to remove Kireyev and <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/3s7ue5v3">requested a three-day recess</a> [press release] to find new lawyers. Kirieyev refused to recuse himself in June.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are  <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into UESU. Last month, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. ECHR President Jean Paul Costa <a href="http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/1235011-v-espch-ne-kommentiruyut-perspektivu-iskov-timoshenko-k-ukraine">refused to comment on the complaint</a> [Korrespondent report, in Russian], but said the matter was before the court. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsame-sex.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] New York <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2011/jul/jul26a_11.html">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> [official website] filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2011/jul/10-cv-8435%20Windsor%20v%20United%20States%20Amicus%20NY%20State.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] challenging the constitutionality of the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>] barring recognition of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marriage">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive]. The brief was <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2011/jul/jul26a_11.html">filed</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] in the case of <span class="casename">Windsor v. United States</span>, arguing that DOMA violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] by precluding same-sex couples from the same rights and privileges of opposite-sex couples, and that it intrudes on what had previously been the the exclusive right of the states to define marriage. The brief argues that since DOMA discriminates based on sex and/or sexual orientation, it should be subjected to a heightened scrutiny standard and that it fails to meet that standard under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text]. The brief further argues that DOMA violates federalism principles: <blockquote>By refusing to recognize for federal purposes marriages that are valid under state law, DOMA intrudes on matters historically within the control of the States, and undermines and denigrates New York's law designed to ensure equality of same-sex and different-sex married couples. Thus DOMA threatens basic principles of federalism. Moreover, it classifies and determines access to rights, benefits, and protections based on sexual orientation, and also based on sex.</blockquote>Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer obtained a legal same-sex marriage in Canada in 2007, but Spyer died just two years later. Windsor is challenging the assessment of estate taxes to property transferred to her upon her wife's death that would not have been assessed on such a transfer between married partners of opposite sex. Scheidernman's action comes just days after New York enacted its same-sex marriage law after <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report] last month. 

<p>US President Barack Obama has <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-supports-doma-repeal.php">expressed support</a> [JURIST report] for the repeal of DOMA and also support for <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced by Congressional Democrats</a> [JURIST report] in February to repeal DOMA. In March, House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] announced that he was launching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">legal advisory group to defend</a> [JURIST report] DOMA, stating "[t]he constitutionality of this law should be determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally, and this action by the House will ensure the matter is addressed in a manner consistent with our Constitution." Democrats introduced the Respect for Marriage Act following February's announcement by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA, which restricts the federal definition of marriage to heterosexual couples, in court cases challenging the provision. The announcement came just one month after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontobamapres.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US President Barack Obama issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/07/25/executive-order-blocking-property-transnational-criminal-organizations">executive order</a> [text] Monday imposing economic sanctions to combat international <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=organized+crime+">organized crime</a> [JURIST news archive] operations, freezing their US assets, preventing the transfer of property to the organizations and criminalizing providing aid the organizations. The order targets four specific Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs), though more could be named in the future: Los Zetas from Mexico, the Yakuza from Japan, the Camorra from Italy and the Brothers Circle based in Eastern Europe. The sanctions were imposed pursuant to the president's authority under the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> (IEEPA) [50 USC &#167; 1701 <em>et seq.</em>], which allows the president to exercise authority "to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat." The sanctions are part of an overall strategy outlined in a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/2011-strategy-combat-transnational-organized-crime.pdf">25-page report</a> [text, PDF] entitled the "Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime." The report defines TCOs as:<blockquote>those self-perpetuating associations of individuals who operate transnationally for the purpose of obtaining power, influence, monetary and/or commercial gains, wholly or in part by illegal means, while protecting their activities through a pattern of corruption and/or violence, or while protecting their illegal activities through a transnational organizational structure and the exploitation of transnational commerce or communication mechanisms. There is no single structure under which transnational organized criminals operate; they vary from hierarchies to clans, networks, and cells, and may evolve to other structures.</blockquote>The report says that TCOs are able to exploit the "interconnected nature of our modern trading, transportation, and transactional systems that move people and commerce throughout the global economy and across our borders," and admits that the US effort against TCOs has been hampered by "a shift in U.S. intelligence collection priorities since the September 11, 2001." Robert Chesney of the University of Texas School of Law <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2011/07/material-support-to-transnational-criminal-organizations/">argues</a> [Lawfare op-ed] that the new strategy against TCOs reflects a shift in the use of economic sanctions that recognizes the role of non-state actors in international affairs, similar to the way in which the US is combating foreign terrorist organizations.

<p>Other countries are taking steps to combat organized crime. Last May, Bulgaria <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bulgaria-government-approves-bill-targeting-organized-crime.php">passed a bill that allows "civil confiscation"</a> [JURIST report] enabling law enforcement to launch investigations of people who cannot account for their income, a move designed to target organized crime. Last July, Italian police <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/italy-police-arrest-hundreds-seize-millions-in-organized-crime-raid.php">arrested more than 300 individuals</a> [JURIST report] and seized millions of euros worth of assets in a countrywide raid on the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/08/15/germany.ndrangheta.reut/index.html">'Ndrangheta</a> [CNN backgrounder] crime organization. The <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html?ref=menutop">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] released a report last June <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-releases-report-detailing-impact-of-global-organized-crime.php">detailing the globalization of international organized crime</a> [JURIST report] and its threat to international security. The report specifically addressed the global economic impact of human and drug trafficking, sale of illicit firearms, piracy, identity theft and the illegal exploitation of natural resources. The report found that while countries such as Afghanistan and Colombia supply the majority of the world's illegal drugs, the profits from the drugs are primarily found in the countries where the drugs are being sold. Human trafficking is reported to generate a profit of USD $3 billion, with 140,000 victims being exploited in Europe alone. Piracy reportedly doubled over the prior year resulting in an annual income of US $100 million, the majority of which goes to organized crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Members of the <a href="http://www.bdr.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Rifles</a> (BDR) [official website], a Bangladeshi paramilitary force, have been tried <em>en masse</em> for the mutiny, which left 74 dead. HRW's call comes in response to the mass <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bangladesh-jails-more-than-650-soldiers-in-connection-to-2009-mutiny.php">sentencing of 657 border guards for their part in the mutiny</a> [JURIST report] by a Bangladesh military court, bringing the total number of soldiers jailed for the mutiny to more than 3,000. Asia Director at HRW Brad Adams said that the mass trials are not fair and that the individuals responsible for the mutiny are not being held accountable:<blockquote>It is impossible to try hundreds of people at the same time and expect anything resembling a fair trial. The massacre shocked Bangladesh, but each of the accused should only be found guilty if the government provides specific evidence against them. The BDR mutiny was ugly and brutal, but the current approach appears to be a witch hunt against a group rather than an attempt to identify the individuals responsible for specific crimes. The government should rethink its approach to make sure the masterminds and perpetrators of serious offenses are brought to fair trial, but end the prosecutions of the rank-and-file who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</blockquote>HRW also contends that the trials are being conducted in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Bangladesh is obligated to uphold. In addition to due process breaches, many of the detainees have been held without charge and without access to legal counsel.

<p>A judge in the Court of Metropolitan Sessions, a criminal court in Bangladesh, <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bangladesh-indicts-430-for-2009-mutiny.php">indicted 430 people</a> [JURIST report] last week for their roles in the mutiny. Last January, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/bangladesh-court-opens-trial-of-800-soldiers-charged-in-2009-mutiny.php">civilian trial of 800 soldiers charged</a> [JURIST report] with crimes stemming from their roles in the 2009 mutiny began in the capital city of Dhaka. The trial involves some of the most serious charges with those found guilty facing the death penalty. The trial is expected to last over a year and to include the testimonies of more than 1,000 individuals. In August 2010, a special Bangladeshi military court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bangladesh-court-convicts-14-border-guards-in-mutiny-trial.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 14 members of the BDR for their roles in the mutiny. The tribunal, led by BDR head Maj. Gen. Mainul Islam, fined each of the men Tk 100 and <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=169661&amp;cid=2">sentenced</a> [BDNews24 report] them to prison terms ranging from four months to six years, one year short of the maximum possible sentence for rebellion under Bangladeshi law. About 3,500 other soldiers will face lesser charges in military courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Without congressional action, same-sex couples will be able to legally wed through a notary public and currently are considered to be in "de facto" unions. The original suit questions Article 113 of the Civil Code, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Declaring that regulating marriage is the legislature's responsibility, the court did make a statement in favor of same-sex marriage, arguing that church animosity toward same-sex couples is an unfair bias: "It is based on prejudice against the homosexual choice. There is no evidence that children raised by same-sex couples suffer traumas or problems. It is clear that same-sex couples who love each other succeed in building relationships. So there is no reason to deprive them the right to marry." The president of the Senate, Juan Manuel Corzo <a href = "http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/articulo-287407-voluntad-popular-validar-matrimonio-heterosexual-juan-corzo">praised the decision</a> [<em>El Espectador</em> report, in Spanish] as enshrining the will of the people. Corzo suggested the LGBT community draft a same-sex marriage bill and see if it passes, although he will vote against it. LGBT rights group <A href = "http://www.colombiadiversa.org/">Colombia Diversa</a> [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.colombiadiversa-blog.org/2011/07/corte-reconoce-las-familias-de-parejas.html">criticized the ruling</a> [press release, in Spanish], saying the court ignored the "bias in the way the Congress of the Republic of Colombia has handled issues related to same-sex couples and failure of duty of protection of minorities in a deficit democracy like ours."

<p>In 2008, the court held that same-sex couples should be given the same <a href = "/paperchase/2008/04/colombia-high-court-extends-pension-and.php">pension and health benefits</a> [JURIST report] as those held by opposite-sex couples. In its <a href="http://190.24.134.68/relatoria/2007/C-811-07.rtf">decision</a> [court materials, in Spanish], the court said that to exclude same-sex couples from receiving such benefits would undermine their fundamental right to human dignity and equal protection of the laws.

The <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsfragments/26-english-language-partners">provision</a> [Home Office backgrounder], which was announced in June 2010 by UK <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/our-organisation/ministers/home-secretary/">Home Secretary Theresa May</a> [official website], requires an immigrant to be <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/nri/visa-and-immigration/indian-couple-in-uk-challenges-immigration-law/articleshow/9385243.cms">able to speak English</a> [<em>Economic Times</em> report] before joining his or her spouse in the UK. The couple's lawyer argued before the High Court in Birmingham that the language requirement violates the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] and called the law "blatantly, admittedly, racially discriminatory." The couple, who have been married for 37 years and have six children, are seeking to live permanently in England after traveling between India and England for 15 years.

<p>Immigration has long been a controversial topic in the UK. The number of UK employers prosecuted for hiring illegal immigrants has <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/uk-cracking-down-on-employers-hiring.php">spiked</a> [JURIST report] since changes to British immigration laws were implemented in February 2008. In 2006, the <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Home Office</a> [official website] announced <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/uk-home-office-plans-to-toughen.php">plans to overhaul</a> [JURIST report] Britain's immigration system in a <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/ind-review-250706?view=Binary">review</a> [text, PDF] outlining how the Home Office's <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/">Immigration and Nationality Directorate</a> [official website] will respond to the impact of globalization, changing travel patterns and evolving international crime and terrorism. The Labour Party government of former prime minister Gordon Brown pursued plans to institute a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uk+ID+cards">national ID card system</a> [JURIST news archive] as part of the UK's effort to <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/uk-home-office-plans-to-toughen.php">clamp down on illegal immigrants</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The initial suit, brought by two scientists, was an attempt to stop federal funding for embryonic stem cells so there was more funding for their research on adult stem cells. Their appeal stated that April's decision only considered one of their arguments and that stem cell research is not "research" under the <a href = "http://embryo.asu.edu/view/embryo:128106">1996 Dickey-Wicker Amendment</a> [text]. Judge Royce Lamberth disagreed, although he was the judge who issued the original injunction, stating that he stands by the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] decision in April as controlling law. A spokesperson for the White House <a href = "http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog">called the decision a victory</a> [press release], and said: "President Obama is committed to supporting responsible stem cell research and today's ruling was another step in the right direction."

<p>Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research has been a long uphill battle for the Obama administration. In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/09/A-debt-of-gratitude-to-so-many-tireless-advocates/">signed</a> [press release] an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Removing-Barriers-to-Responsible-Scientific-Research-Involving-Human-Stem-Cells/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-reverses-stem-cell-research-ban.php">report</a>] which removed the previous administration's eight-year restriction on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. After the preliminary injunction on stem research was granted last year, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/obama-administration-appeals-stem-cell-research-block.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the injunction, arguing that the ruling was overbroad, endangering an array of research across multiple programs and centers while only serving a very attenuated economic interest of the plaintiffs in the case. While the appeals process was underway, the court granted a long-term stay which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-lifts-stem-cell-research-ban.php">allowed federal funding to continue</a> [JURIST report] while the court reached a decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At a conference at the <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/">Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> [official website; DRC <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/genocide/analysis/details.php?content=2011-07-26">conference page</a>] in Washington, advocates called for Ntaganda's arrest prior to the DRC presidential and legislative elections that are scheduled to take place in November. Senior Researcher at HRW Anneke van Woudenberg said that arresting key war crimes suspects like Ntaganda would <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/article/dr-congo-urged-nab-war-crimes-suspects-vote">quell the unrest</a> [RNW report] and "tear away the culture of impunity in Congo."

<p>The warrant for Ntaganda's arrest was originally issued in 2006 but was not <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icc-unseals-arrest-warrant-for-congo.php">made public by the ICC</a> [JURIST report] until 2008. The arrest warrant was issued under seal because "public knowledge of the proceedings in this case might result in Bosco Ntaganda hiding, fleeing, and/or obstructing or endangering the investigations or the proceedings of the Court," but ICC judges determined that those circumstances have since changed. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/10/12/dr-congo-icc-indicted-war-criminal-involved-assassinations-opponents">urged the Congolese government to arrest</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">report</a>] Ntaganda in October 2010. Ntaganda lives and moves openly in Goma, a city in the eastern bloc of the DRC. He gained leadership of the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP) rebel group in 2009 as a result of a coup against former leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3786883.stm">Laurent Nkunda</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Laurent+Nkunda">news archive</a>]. Ntaganda became a general of the Congolese army after promising to integrate the rebel forces into the Congolese troops. As a result, the government has refused to execute the ICC arrest warrant against him, claiming that his presence is needed in order to maintain peace withing the troops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HB 56, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law last month</a> [JURIST report], expands restrictions on undocumented immigrants by allowing law enforcement to detain individuals under "reasonable suspicion" they are undocumented and forces employers to verify the immigration status of potential employees. The <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2011/07/27/immigrants-sue-alabama-over-immigration-law/">five plaintiffs include</a> [Fox News report] two Mexican immigrants, two undocumented immigrants who remain anonymous and another anonymous plaintiff who is married to an undocumented immigrant. This lawsuit differs from the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-alabama-immigration-law.php">one filed earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] in federal court by rights groups led by the <a href="http://aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] because it focuses on violations of state law. Thomas Drake II, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, <a href="http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/07/another_challenge_to_alabama_i.html">said that the Alabama constitution is more liberal</a> [<em>The Huntsville Times</em> report] than the US Constitution because it protects a broader variety of rights and that they also plan to join the ACLU lawsuit. The <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/ACASLoginMac.asp">Alabama Constitution</a> [text] says in Article I &#167; 30, "[t]hat immigration shall be encouraged; emigration shall not be prohibited, and no citizen shall be exiled." The ACLU lawsuit argues that HB 56 is preempted by federal law and that, among other constitutional violations, it violates the Fourth Amendment by subjecting citizens and non-citizens with permission to be in the US to unreasonable searches and seizures.

<p>The ACLU and the <a href="http://www.hispanicinterest.org/">Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-seek-to-bar-alabama-immigration-law.php">motion for a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to block the implementation of HB 56 which is set to take effect on September 1. The rights groups argue that they are entitled to a preliminary injunction because of their substantial likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable injury to plaintiffs and because the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest. Alabama <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] signed HB 56 into law last month, just one week after it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">passed by the legislature</a> [JURIST reports]. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. Similar laws have been passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports].

USA</a> [Justia backgrounder] on cross-appeals from a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-upholds-restrictions-on.php">tobacco advertising decision</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. The January ruling <a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/pressoffice/district_court_opinion_01052010.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the majority of restrictions on cigarette advertising imposed by the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text], a law designed to limit the tobacco industry's ability to advertise to children, including a ban on distributing clothing and goods with logos or brand names, as well as sponsorship of cultural, athletic and social events. Several tobacco companies are appealing this ruling. Although this was considered a victory for anti-tobacco activists, the judgment did permit the continued use of color and graphics in tobacco advertisements and labels, striking down those portions of the law, and the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official side], joined by a variety of anti-smoking groups are appealing that part of the judgment. The DOJ <a href = "http://www.dispatchpolitics.com/live/content/national_world/stories/2011/07/28/tobacco-companies-challenge-law-as-limit-on-free-speech.html?sid=101">argued</a> [AP report] for the reinstatement of those provisions, explaining that the government has a right to regulate tobacco as they see fit, due to its lethal and addictive nature. The <a href = "http://publichealthlawcenter.org/">Public Health Law Center</a> [advocacy website] filed an <a href = "http://publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/amicus-discount-2010.pdf"><em>amicus brief</em></a> [text, PDF] agreeing with the DOJ: <blockquote>It was the tobacco companies who turned seemingly straightforward terms like "lights" into misleading Orwellian caricatures; it was they who so corrupted the market for MRTPs ["modified risk tobacco products"] that the only way to make it safe was to require FDA approval beforehand; it was they who through deception and manipulation created the need for the graphic warning labels. The FSPTCA is an appropriate response to a continuing catastrophe.</blockquote> <a href = "http://www.rjrt.com/">R.J. Reynolds Co.</a> [corporate website], the manufacturer of several popular cigarette brands, argued that the limitations on free speech were so sweeping that it restricts adults unfairly. It is unknown when the three-judge panel for the Sixth Circuit will rule on the case.

<p>In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">US President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed the FSPTCA into law</a> [JURIST report] granting the FDA certain authority to regulate tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients. The bill gives the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products but does not permit the agency to regulate tobacco leaf that is not in the hands of tobacco product manufacturers or producers of tobacco leaf, including tobacco growers, tobacco warehouses and tobacco grower cooperatives. Cigarettes and other tobacco products have been subject to strict marketing regulations on both the federal and state levels. Earlier this month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-over-constitutional-right-to-sell-cigarettes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit over the constitutional right to sell cigarettes in pharmacies. The court upheld the ordinance citing health risks associated with smoking cigarettes and said, "through the sale of tobacco products, pharmacies convey tacit approval of the purchase and use of tobacco products, which sends a mixed message to consumers who generally patronize pharmacies for health care services." Earlier this year, two tobacco companies <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tobacco-companies-file-lawsuit-against-fda-advisory-panel.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] against the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] to enjoin a recent opinion by the agency's advisory committee due to conflicts of interest. Last year, the FDA announced a final <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/FDA-1995-N-0259-0002.htm">rule</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/fda-announces-final-rule-restricting.php">restricting tobacco sales and promotions</a> [JURIST report] directed at youth. The Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents are a set of broad regulations "designed to significantly curb access to and the appeal of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to children and adolescents in the United States."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lebedev and his former business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] in the <a href="http://hamovnichesky.msk.sudrf.ru/">Khamovinchesky District Court</a> [official website, in Russian] on charges connected with embezzling more than $27 billion from Yukos oil. Lebedev's lawyer indicated he <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110727/165421055.html">would appeal</a> [RIA Novosti report] the court's parole denial. In January, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev's lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/khodorkovsky-appeals-extended-sentence.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging their six-year extended sentences for embezzlement and fraud. Unless the appeal succeeds, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are expected to remain imprisoned through 2017.

<p>Russia's Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights announced in February that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/russia-presidential-rights-council-to-examine-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">look into the verdicts</a> [JURIST report] handed down against Lebedev and Khodorkovsky. Prior to this conviction, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were already serving eight-year prison sentences for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report]. International human rights organizations and numerous governments <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">guilty verdict</a> [JURIST reports]. Last year, former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister <a thref="http://www.premier.gov.ru/eng/">Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the <a target="_blank" href="http://kprf.ru/">Communist Party</a> [party website, in Russian] without first getting approval to do so from the president. Some critics of the Russian government have argued that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are <a href="/forumy/2009/07/strong-arm-rule-or-rule-of-law.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST op-ed] due to Khodorkovsky's opposition to Putin. In March 2010, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty. The statement echoed concerns Khodorkovsky had previously expressed about the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/russia-trials-without-juries-unfair-to.php">fairness of Russian trials</a> and the need for widespread <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/judicial-reform-essential-for-russias.php">reform of the Russian court system</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ouattara <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/27/ivory-coast-investigation-violence_n_911247.html">said that even his loyalists</a> [Huffington Post report] responsible for the violence will be brought to justice. However, Ouattara said that due to the state of the Ivory Coast legal system that prosecution should be carried out by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Last month, Ouattara <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ivory-coast-signs-accord-allowing-icc-investigation-to-proceed.php">granted permission</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC to investigate the violence following the presidential elections in which former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] refused to leave office after losing the election. Ouattara made the statements before meeting with UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] at the UN headquarters in New York. The <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39159&Cr=ivoire&Cr1=">unanimously recommended extending</a> [UN news report] the UN's peacekeeping mandate until July 31, 2012 at its current level of 9,800 troops. Ouattara, earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-sets-up-commission-to-investigate-post-election-violence.php">set up a commission of inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to investigate crimes and human rights violations that took place during post-election violence. The commission will investigate the abuses and provide recommendations for implementing measures to prevent similar incidents.

<p>The Ivory Coast has already <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-issues-international-arrest-warrants-for-gbagbo-aides.php">issued international arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gbagbo aides, most notably for Charles Ble Goude, the leader of Gbagbo's youth militia, accusing him of inciting ethnic violence and attacks against UN workers. Other members of Gbagbo's government also had warrants issued including the government spokesman Ahoua Don Mello, industry minister Phillipe Attey, and the ambassador to Israel Raymond Koudou Kessie. Twenty-one others already in detention were charged for violence and inciting tribalism and xenophobia. In June, ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] officially <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-requests-permission-to-investigate-ivory-coast.php">requested permission from ICC judges</a> [JURIST report] to begin investigation into the Ivory Coast after determining that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have been committed during the violence. Since the Ivory Coast is not a member state of the ICC because it is not a signatory of the <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/0D8024D3-87EA-4E6A-8A27-05B987C38689/0/RomeStatuteEng.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], the ICC can only investigate with the Ivory Coast's express permission. In April, Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured and forced from office</a> [JURIST report] after refusing to leave despite losing last November's election to Ouattara, which resulted in months of fighting between Ouattara's and Gbagbo's forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The High Authority to Combat Corruption will be comprised of government administration and private sector representatives who will monitor corruption levels, conduct studies and investigations into corrupt behavior and implement measures aiming to deter corruption. The government justified the creation of the agency, arguing that corruption hinders economic growth and social well-being, and increases social inequality and poverty levels. The government also noted that the agency will improve Niger's compliance with the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/Publications/Convention/08-50026_E.pdf">UN Convention Against Corruption</a> [text, PDF; UNODC <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html">backgrounder</a>].

<p>Corruption allegations have plagued Niger in recent years. In May, an appeals court in Niger's capital Niamey <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/niger-court-drops-corruption-charges-against-ex-president-tandja.php">ordered the release</a> [JURIST report] of former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8181537.stm">Mamadou Tandja</a> [BBC profile] after dropping all corruption charges against the ousted leader who has been in custody for 14 months following a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-president-held-hostage-in.php">military coup</a> [JURIST report] in February 2010. The military junta <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7490CM20110510">charged Tandja with corruption</a> [Reuters report] following his removal, based on a junta investigation that found USD $128 million was stolen during Tandja's 10-year presidency. In September 2009, members of Nigerien opposition parties said that police had detained 30 former opposition lawmakers allegedly at the behest of Tandja. The 30 former members of parliament were arrested on <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/niger-opposition-lawmakers-arrested-for.php">charges of embezzlement</a> [JURIST report], but were likely being targeted for their dissidence, as they refused to recognize Tandja's expansion of powers. In February of last year, the United Front for the Safeguard of Democratic Assets (Fusad), a Nigerien rights group, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-rights-group-urges-prosecution-of.php">pushed for the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of Tandja on treason charges and corruption violating the constitution shortly after the coup.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a member of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], Italy is a party to the  <a href="http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4242370.PDF">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] last month. The resolution is the first to call for an end to sexuality discrimination worldwide and to recognize it as a "priority" for the UN. However, the resolution does not address any penalties for violating the act nor is it binding for members. Italy is one of few Western European nations that does not offer legal recognition to same-sex couples.

Newzbin2 is an aggregator of content, but does not develop any illegal content itself, simply making the content more accessible. BT recently developed a filtering service that prevents its users from accessing child pornography, which the court now requires it implement to block Newzbin2, but not other file-sharing sites. Although the filtering system can be evaded, Justice Richard Arnold said if the system stops a minority of users from file-sharing, it is enough, and rejected arguments that users of BT did not have knowledge of copyright infringement. However, Arnold downplayed the possibility of a "wave" of suits to block other file-sharing sites.<blockquote>Turning to other websites that provide access to infringing copies of copyright material, I accept that it is likely that rightholders will wish to obtain similar orders relating to those. It should be borne in mind, however, that in this case the Studios started from the point that they had already obtained judgment against Newzbin Ltd. Even so, the Studios have had to obtain and put before the Court a substantial quantity of evidence in support of the present application. In addition, the application involved the preparation by counsel for the Studios of a lengthy and detailed skeleton argument, a two-day hearing and written submissions following the hearing. Thus this will have been a costly application for the Studios to bring. ... Furthermore, although I cannot prejudge later arguments in this case, it is not inevitable that future applicants will recover all their costs even if successful. ... For these reasons, even if the present application is successful, I think it is clear that rightholders will not undertake future applications lightly. On the contrary, I consider it probable that they will concentrate their resources on seeking relief in respect of the more egregious infringers. I therefore do not anticipate a flood of such applications.</blockquote>The MPAA <a href = "http://blog.mpaa.org/BlogOS/post/2011/07/28/Newzbin2-Court-Ruling.aspx">declared</a> [press release] the ruling a great victory, and said it rejects the arguments that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have no responsibility to fight copyright infringement. <a href = "http://www.openrightsgroup.org/">Open Rights Group</a> [advocacy website], a group devoted to protecting internet freedoms, called the blocking <a href = "http://www.openrightsgroup.org/press/press-releases/newzbin-block:-pointless-and-dangerous/">"pointless and dangerous"</a> [press release].

<p>The British <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/">Department for Business Innovation and Skills</a> [official website] in 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/uk-proposes-suspending-internet-service.php">proposed stricter sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against illegal file-sharing that would include restricting and suspending user Internet access. The changes targeted repeat offenders by requiring ISPs to block download sites, reduce a user's broadband speeds and ultimately shut down the user's Internet access. Costs to implement these measures would be shared between users and service providers. This eventually became the <a href = "http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/24/contents">Digital Economy Act</a> [materials] passed in 2010. It is currently under judicial review.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AB</a> [docket] to British former servicemen seeking compensation for illnesses resulting from participating in nuclear weapons testing. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14320465">veterans are seeking to overturn</a> [BBC report] a 2009 High Court <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/mod-ab-others-22112010.pdf">ruling</a> [judgment, PDF] that denied the men compensation for the adverse health consequences allegedly resulting from exposure to radiation. The men claim that between October 1952 and September 1958, the British government performed nuclear weapons testing in Australia and on Christmas Island, and that the radiation exposure from those tests caused illnesses including cancers, skin defects and birth defects in their children. The lower court ruled that 9 of the 10 lead cases were barred by the statute of limitations. The defendant, UK <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Home/">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website], contends that the group of over 1,000 veterans will not be able to show that the radiation caused their illnesses. The High Court will hear arguments for damages later this year.

<p>Victims of radiation exposure have sought compensation on numerous occasions. In 2009, the Tokyo High Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/japan-court-grants-recognition-to.php">granted an appeal</a> [JURIST report] to consider 30 people for official recognition as atomic bomb victims resulting from the US atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August, 1945.

In 2006, a British veteran <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/staffordshire/5213948.stm">received &#163; 40,000</a> [BBC report] from the US under the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usdoj.gov/civil/torts/const/reca/">Radiation Exposure Compensation Act</a> [materials text] for his involvement in the allied British-US testing.

Judge Robert Hinkle, who heard the arguments, <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/florida/flndce/4:2010cv00423/59664/27/">partially denied a preliminary injunction</a> [opinion, text] in October to stop enforcement of the challenged campaign finance law prior to last fall's election. The plaintiffs, represented by the <a href="http://www.ij.org/">Institute for Justice</a> [advocacy website], are four Sarasota residents who wanted to finance air radio ads that they created opposing a state constitutional amendment. The four plaintiffs intended to spend $150 each to air the ads and also wished to collect monetary contributions from others to air the ads more frequently. The Florida <a href="http://www.dos.state.fl.us/Default.aspx">Department of State</a> [official website] considered the group to constitute a "political committee" under <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/filestores/web/statutes/fs07/CH0106/Section_0106.011.HTM">Fla. Stat. &#167; 106.011(1)(a)</a> [text] and wants to require them to comply with the attendant campaign contribution regulations such as disclosure and filing requirements. At oral arguments Wednesday, the plaintiffs <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/07/27/2332644/judge-hearing-challenge-to-fla.html#ixzz1TP9myxGE">argued these requirements should not be applied to grassroots organizations</a> [AP report] since they are stricter than the campaign financing requirements for labor unions and corporations. Their lawyer cited the US  <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>], which eased restrictions on political campaign spending by corporations and labor unions on <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] grounds. Hinkle countered that <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> made no mention of political committees. The Florida State Department argued that such requirements are necessary for the electorate to know who is donating money since many grassroots organizations use ambiguous names. It is unknown when Hinkle will rule but the Institute for Justice announced plans to appeal if ruled against.

<p>The Florida federal courts have been a battleground over campaign finance regulation. Last month, Judge Hinkle <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-judge-enjoins-state-campaign-finance-matching-funds-law.php">enjoined a campaign finance law</a> [JURIST report] providing matching funds for publicly-financed candidates. The lawsuit was brought by now Florida <a href="http://www.rickscottforflorida.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> (R) [campaign website] during last year's Republican gubernatorial primary when he was running against a publicly-financed candidate. Scott argued the law violated his First Amendment rights because it limited his campaign expenditures to $24.9 million since every dollar over would be matched in public funding for his opponent. Hinkle struck down the law after issuing a temporary injunction blocking it during the primary campaign. Hinkle's reasoning in that case closely followed the 5-4 Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-238">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-Arizona-campaign-finance-restriction.php">report</a>] striking down a similar Arizona campaign finance law, also on First Amendment grounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The petition comes in response to a June <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] finding PPACA's individual mandate provision constitutional. TMLC, along with four individual plaintiffs, seek a declaration that Congress lacks authority under the <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to pass such a law. The plaintiffs contend that the individual mandate provision falls outside the regulation of "economic activity," and is therefore not authorized by the Commerce Clause:<blockquote>The Act does not regulate economic activity, but rather the decision to not engage in commercial or economic activity. Consequently, the Act does not even pretend to fit within any of the Court&#8217;s previous Commerce Clause rulings. The individual mandate attaches to a legal resident of the United States who chooses to sit at home and do nothing. This resident, quite literally, merely exists (i.e., he is &#8220;living&#8221; and &#8220;breathing&#8221;). He or she is neither engaged in economic activity nor in any other activity that would bring him or her within the reach of even a legitimate regulatory scheme.</blockquote>The group says that "review is necessary to establish a meaningful limitation on congressional power." The TMLC lawsuit is the first PPACA challenge to petition the Supreme Court out of the many lawsuits in the circuit courts.

<p>Similar cases challenging the constitutionality of PPACA are being heard in federal courts across the nation. In June, a three-judge panel of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/third-circuit-hears-arguments-in-health-care-law-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Earlier in June, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eleventh-circuit-hears-arguments-on-constitutionality-of-new-health-care-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] concerning the mandate's constitutionality. The appeal was brought by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] after the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] struck down the entire health care law because the individual mandate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">exceeds Congress's authority</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause. Also last month, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decided it could rule on two challenges to PPACA after the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/fourth-circuit-questions-authority-to-hear-health-care-law-challenge.php">requested briefs</a> [JURIST report] from all parties on whether the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> (AIA) [text], which prevents injunctions against taxes before the tax is imposed, would bar review of PPACA until it is implemented. The Fourth Circuit already <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in May to resolve a split decision between the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against the individual mandate</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports] of the law.</p>

Leveson said the panel will investigate the media and reporters' relationship with police and politicians, as well as the tactics media agents use to get information. A report, with any recommendations for reform, will be published in a year. Leveson gave more details on the panel's role and powers Thursday, emphasizing that the panel will be calling witnesses and seeking "relevant documents." Leveson said that although he has the power to compel production of files of "inappropriate" practices, he would prefer editors and journalists to cooperate with his inquiry and volunteer information.

</object></center>

<p>In addition to print media journalists, the panel will also investigate public broadcasters and bloggers. Leveson and his panel is empowered by the <a href = "http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/12/contents">Inquiries Act of 2005</a> [materials]. The panel consists of Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty; George Jones, former Daily Telegraph political editor; Sir David Bell, former chairman of the Financial Times; Elinor Goodman, former Channel 4 political editor; Lord David Currie, former chairman of Ofcom; and Sir Paul Scott-Lee, former West Midlands chief constable. Hearings are set to begin in September.</p>

<p>Cameron created the panel after the recent allegations of "phone hacking" surfaced in the British media. Reports allege that journalists for the now-defunct British tabloid, <em><a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/">News of the World</a></em> [media website], a  <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/">News Corporation</a> (News Corp.) [media website]  subsidiary, paid London police officers for private information, including telephone records, to use in various news stories, as well as hiring private investigators to "hack" into voicemail inboxes of notable people. Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of <a href="http://www.nicommercial.com/">News International</a> (NI) and former editor of <em>News of the World</em></a> [media websites], was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/former-newspaper-ceo-arrested-in-phone-hacking-scandal.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month by UK police on charges related to the scandal. She was questioned and released on bail hours later. Brooks was editor of <em>News of the World</em> from 2000 to 2003 when the phone of murdered teen Amanda Dowler was allegedly hacked. Brooks, along with a number of high-ranking executives and journalists, have been arrested in relation to phone hacking allegations. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] will <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/fbi-to-probe-news-corp-in-911-phone-hacking-scandal.php">open an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into whether journalists working for News Corp. and its subsidiaries violated US laws by hacking into the mobile phones of <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] victims.

The announcement <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE76R1S820110728?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">comes amid speculation</a> [Reuters report] that the trial would be held at a Red Sea resort because of Mubarak's alleged poor health. Many Egyptians contend that Mubarak is not ill and that members of the government have claimed the ex-president is sick in an effort to avoid a swift, public trial. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-prosecutor-mubarak-to-stand-trial-could-face-death-penalty.php">faces several charges</a> [JURIST report], including murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to <a target="_blank" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">general abuse of power</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report], as a result of his response to pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year. The trial date for Mubarak is set for <a target="_blank" href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/13429/Egypt/Politics-/Mubaraks-to-be-tried-on--August-for-corruption-and.aspx">August 3 at the Cairo Criminal Court</a> [MENA report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/egypt-to-try-mubarak-in-august.php">report</a>].

<p>Earlier this week, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, until August 3. Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-postpones-questioning-after-mubarak-hospitalized.php">hospitalized in April</a> [JURIST report], just days before he was scheduled to appear before Egypt's public prosecutor for questioning about his alleged roles in protester deaths and embezzlement of government money. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters. <a target="_blank" href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report], and more than 6,000 were injured, during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arntz</a> [materials] on Thursday that a San Francisco public referendum  to ban circumcision cannot appear on the ballot in November. The <a href = "http://www.sfmgmbill.org/Site/Home.html">Male Genital Mutilitation bill</a> [text] would have made male circumcision illegal in San Francisco if the recipient is under the age of 18, with perpetrators penalized by a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment. Male circumcision is a religious practice in both Judaism and Islam, so there was an immediate protest to the initiative. Judge Loretta Giorgi <a href = "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/07/27/bloomberg1376-LP0LLP1A1I4H01-5U9ET3HHI3EDBIQCVO8EN54JRO.DTL">ruled</a> [Bloomberg report] against the referendum, stating that it served no legitimate purpose since it is pre-empted and thus prohibited by <a href = "http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/calawquery?codesection=bpc&codebody=&hits=20">California's Business and Professions Code</a> [text], which prohibits regulation of medical services. Giorgi also stated that a ban would violate the constitutional right to free exercise of religion. A spokesperson for the <a href = "http://www.jcrc.org/">Jewish Community Relations Council</a> [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cityinsider/detail?entry_id=94103">told the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a> [report] that the group is delighted the measure will not appear on the ballot.

<p>Supporters of outlawing male circumcision have pressed forward elsewhere in the US. <a href = "http://www.mgmbill.org/">MGMBill.org</a> [advocacy website] is devoted to submitting legislation to ban the practice, and currently has bills pending in the Federal government as well as 46 states. Advocates for ending male circumcision believe it is a painful and archaic procedure that nets no benefits to the circumcised male. They frequently compare the practice to female genital mutilation, which is illegal under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000116----000-.html">Title 18</a> [text] of the US Code.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/28/libya-lawsuit-nato_n_912033.html">complaint was filed</a> [AP report] on behalf of retired Libyan general and member of Libya's Revolutionary Council, Khalid el Hamidi, whose three children were killed and home was destroyed during an air strike on June 20. Marcel Ceccaldi, an attorney representing Hamidi, said that civil cases against NATO fall under Belgium jurisdiction. NATO benefits from diplomatic immunity from criminal cases given its status as an international organization. NATO has acknowledged targeting the area, but justified the attack, calling the compound a "command and control" center. The plaintiffs contend that the air strike violated the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [ICRC materials] rules of war because the targeted area was a residential compound. Ceccaldi also urged the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the alleged war crime, suggesting the case would be a good opportunity for the ICC to restore credibility.

<p>The ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099314.pdf">issued arrest warrants</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">report</a>] against Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and two of his high-ranking officials in June. ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] said his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">gathered "direct evidence"</a> [JURIST report] that shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protesters, that his forces used live ammunition on crowds, attacked civilians in their homes, used heavy weapons against people in funeral processions and placed snipers to shoot those leaving mosques after prayer services. Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in May that his office was pursuing arrest warrants against Gaddafi and the two others in his inner circle. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes and human rights violations over the Libyan revolt. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], after an investigative panel, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> on human righsts abuses in Libya, decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend its mandate</a> [JURIST reports], instructing it to continue investigating allegations. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed varying crimes against humanity  "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rhode Island has had a longstanding rejection of the death penalty. Pleau's attorneys <a href = "http://newsblog.projo.com/2011/07/appeals-court-to-decide-custod.html">claimed</a> [<em>Providence Journal</em> report] that the federal government does not have the jurisdiction to detain Pleau after Rhode Island <a href = "http://www.governor.ri.gov/">Governor Lincoln Chafee</a> [official website] refused to surrender him on June 23. Federal prosecutors' ability to seize Pleau is codified by the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18a/usc_sup_05_18_10_sq2.html">Interstate Agreement on Detainers</a> [text], but that law allows state governors to refuse to transfer prisoners to federal custody: "the Governor of the sending State may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner." The <a href = "http://www.rid.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Rhode Island</a> [official website] ordered Chafee to turn Pleau over to federal agents on June 30. Chafee said he would comply, but Pleau's attorneys appealed to the First Circuit, at which point Chafee <a href = "http://www.woonsocketcall.com/node/2950">filed an <em>amicus brief</em></a> [<em>The Call</em> report]. Donald Lockhart, for the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/usao/">US Attorney's Office</a> [official website], argued that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers is pre-empted by the District Court's order, and that the Governor's office has no standing in the case. Lockhart stressed urgency and asked that the three-judge panel rule on the issue as soon as possible. Although the panel let Chafee personally argue on behalf of Pleau, they stressed that he must officially intervene to continue his role in the case. After the hearing, Chafee <a href = "http://articles.boston.com/2011-07-28/news/29825675_1_appeal-in-murder-case-appeals-court-death-penalty">filed a motion to intervene</a> [AP report], claiming that he has standing to protect his state's sovereignty. The US Attorneys Office plans to challenge this motion. Chafee has also stated that he will appeal to the US Supreme Court if necessary.

<p>Pleau was sentenced to <a href = "http://www.woonsocketcall.com/node/2468">18 years in prison</a> [<em>The Call</em> report] for violating his probation after being accused of killing a gas station attendant in the process of a robbery. <a href = "http://www.woonsocketcall.com/node/2792">No state charges were filed</a> [<em>The Call</em> report], as Rhode Island <a href = "http://www.peterkilmartin.com/">Attorney General Peter Kilmartin</a> [official website] decided that the US Attorney's Office had jurisdiction for the crime beyond the probation violation. However, should federal proceedings not occur, Pleau has <a href = "http://www.boston.com/Boston/metrodesk/2011/07/balks-turning-over-murder-defendant-feds/7XZl9KI88D2XZHeshPQuwO/index.html">agreed to plead guilty and accept a life sentence</a> [Boston.com report] without the possibility of parole. Rhode Island was one of the first states to abolish the death penalty, abolishing it in 1852. After becoming a state, Rhode Island has only executed seven people, including John Gordon in 1845, who Chafee <a href = "http://www.ri.gov/press/view/14182">recently pardoned</a> [press release], delivering a statement on his stance on the death penalty: "John Gordon&#8217;s wrongful execution was a major factor in Rhode Island&#8217;s abolition of and longstanding opposition to the death penalty. ... as we pardon John Gordon, we also recognize and uphold that commitment."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote means the legislation will become North Carolina law as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/House/House.html">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-house-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">also voted to override the veto</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.news-record.com/content/2011/07/26/article/house_votes_to_over_abortion_bill_veto">72-47 vote</a> [<em>News-Record</em> report]. The measure, known as the "Women's Right to Know Act," would require a physician to provide information to the woman regarding gestation, the risks of abortion procedures, abortion alternatives and federal medical benefits available. The law also requires women seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound of the fetus prior to the procedure. Senator Martin Nesbitt (D) <a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20110729/NEWS/307290039/Abortion-restrictions-become-NC-law?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|Frontpage">called the law "draconian"</a> [<em>Citizen Times</em> report] and said women seeking abortions will face dramatic changes once the law takes effect, while supporters contend that the new law will give women the opportunity to "know all the facts" about abortion. The legislation, which had originally passed the House 71-48 and the Senate 29-20, will take effect in 90 days.

<p>The North Carolina government is one of several state legislatures to have acted recently to limit abortion rights. Both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-govenor-signs-bill-restricting-access-to-abortions.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] have recently passed bills requiring ultrasounds before abortions. Last month, the <a target="_blank" href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">lawsuit challenging the Texas law</a> [JURIST report]. In March, South Dakota passed a law requiring a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">three-day waiting period</a> [JURIST report] before an abortion&#8212;the longest waiting period in the country. That law is also facing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">court challenge</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The EIB is already considering petitions from opponents of the <a href="http://nmenvirolaw.org/images/pdf/GHG_20_2_100_NMAC_filed.pdf">regulations</a> [text, PDF]. New Energy Economy, represented by the <a href="http://nmenvirolaw.org/index.php">New Mexico Environmental Law Center</a> (NMELC) [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9OO8GCG0.htm">argued</a> [AP report] that it was necessary to have a party to defend the law before the board to maintain the adversarial system. The court <a href="http://nmenvirolaw.org/index.php/site/more/nmelc_gains_another_victory_in_new_mexico_supreme_court/">ruled</a> [press release] that since NEE was a party to the original proceedings before the EIB it should be granted the right to defend it in this appeal. The executive director of NEE, Mariel Nanasi, <a href="http://newenergyeconomy.org/2011/07/27/press-release-nm-state-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-new-energy-economy/">lauded</a> [press release] the decision: "We are pleased that the Supreme Court has ruled in our favor. The Court's decision upholds the rule of law against special interests and their lobbyists. We now look forward to defending the carbon pollution reduction rule based on its economic and scientific merits."

<p>California has encountered similar difficulties passing greenhouse gas emissions standards. In March, the <a href="http://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/index.aspx?page=1">San Francisco Superior Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-court-delays-implementation-of-cap-and-trade-program.php">delayed the implementation of a cap-and-trade program</a> [JURIST report] by requiring California's <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">Air Resources Board</a> (ARB) [official website] to further analyze alternatives. While the court's decision did not officially preclude the ARB from adopting or implementing the program in the future, it delayed the process as the ARB will now have to conduct additional research on other available options and report back as to why the cap-and-trade program is superior as well as invite public comment on the issue. Earlier this year, Texas <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/court-denies-texas-request-for-stay-of-new-epa-rules.php">failed for the third time in two months</a> [JURIST report] at its attempts to block new <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] denied the state's request to block the program, which allocates greenhouse gas emission permits under the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/caa.html">Clean Air Act</a> [materials]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors had accused Kasab of being one of the gunmen photographed during the attacks, which were allegedly coordinated by Pakistani militant group <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17882/">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT) [CFR backgrounder]. He was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/india-court-sentences-mumbai-gunman-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> after the prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/india-prosecutors-seeking-death-penalty-in-mumbai-terror-trial.php">sought the death penalty</a> [JURIST reports], citing eight aggravating circumstances. In February, an Indian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/india-appeals-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-mumbai-gunman.php">upheld Kasab's conviction and death sentence</a> [JURIST report].

Two alleged Indian accomplices tried with Kasab were acquitted on all charges of helping to plan the attacks. Kasab is the only surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks.

<p>Suspects connected to the Mumbai terror attacks continue to face arrest and prosecution. In March, US citizen and Chicago resident David Headley <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/March/10-ag-277.html">pleaded guilty</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/mumbai-terror-suspect-pleads-guilty-in.php">report</a>] to 12 counts of federal terrorism stemming from the Mumbai terror attacks and a terror incident in Copenhagen.

In December, Spanish authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/spain-authorities-arrest-mumbai-terror-attack-suspects.php">arrested seven men</a> [JURIST report], including six Pakistanis and one Nigerian, in Barcelona suspected of aiding in the Mumbai terror attacks by allegedly stealing passports and other identification documents belonging to male tourists between the ages of 20 and 30, then sending the documents to Thailand where they would be forged and then forwarded to terrorist groups.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttobacco.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] issued rulings in two major tobacco products cases Friday relieving the federal government of liability for tobacco-related health problems and allowing the provinces to sue the tobacco industry for damages for tobacco-related health care costs. The court <a href = "http://scc.lexum.org/en/2011/2011scc42/2011scc42.html">ruled</a> [text; <a href = "http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/sum-som-eng.aspx?cas=33559">materials</a>] unanimously on Friday in <span class = "casename">R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</span> that the federal government is not liable for any tobacco-related death or illness. Citizens filed suit against <a href = "http://www.imperialtobaccocanada.com/groupca/sites/IMP_7VSH6J.nsf/vwlivelookupHomePage/HOME?opendocument">Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</a> [corporate website] for causing their illnesses by improper advertising of "light" and "mild" cigarettes as healthier alternatives. Imperial Tobacco impleaded the federal government, alleging that if tobacco companies are held liable, Canada must also be liable for allowing misrepresentation and negligent design to occur, and claimed that Canada was also a manufacturer under the <a href = "http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/04002_04">Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act</a> and the <a href = "http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/laws/stat/rsnl-1990-c-t-7/latest/rsnl-1990-c-t-7.html">Trade Practices Act</a> [texts]. The Supreme Court rejected these arguments:<blockquote>Here, on the facts as pleaded, Canada did not owe a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care to consumers. The relationship between the two was limited to Canada's statements to the general public that low-tar cigarettes are less hazardous. There were no specific interactions between Canada and the class members. Consequently, a finding of proximity in this relationship must arise from the governing statutes. However, the relevant statutes establish only general duties to the public, and no private law duties to consumers. ... As for the tobacco companies, the facts pleaded allege a history of interactions between Canada and the tobacco companies capable of establishing a special relationship of proximity giving rise to a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care. ... Canada's alleged negligent misrepresentations do not give rise to tort liability, however, because of conflicting policy considerations. The alleged representations constitute protected expressions of government policy. Core government policy decisions protected from suit are decisions as to a course or principle of action that are based on public policy considerations, such as economic, social and political factors, provided they are neither irrational nor taken in bad faith. The representations in this case were part and parcel of a government policy, adopted at the highest level in the Canadian government and developed out of concern for the health of Canadians and the individual and institutional costs associated with tobacco-related disease, to encourage people who continued to smoke to switch to low-tar cigarettes.</blockquote>Although the Canadian government had encouraged the making of light cigarettes to reduce tobacco-related illnesses, the Court rejected that as proof of culpability. Imperial Tobacco has <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/ivoryCoastNews/idAFN1E76S0J220110729?pageNumber=3&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">not commented</a> [Reuters report] on the ruling.

<p>In the same opinion on Friday, the Supreme Court <a href = "http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/sum-som-eng.aspx?cas=33563">ruled</a> [materials] in <span class = "casename">Attorney General of Canada v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of British Columbia</span> that individual provinces are able to sue tobacco companies for damages to offset the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses. In 2001, British Columbia attempted to recover funds from 14 tobacco companies that the government had spent paying for medical care of those afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses. They based their claim on the <a href = "http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_00030_01">Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act</a> (CRA) [text], which makes tobacco manufacturers liable to the provinces for health care costs. As Canada has national healthcare, each province bears the cost of their citizens' medical bills. In this case as well, the appealing tobacco industries alleged that Canada is also a manufacturer and supplier of cigarettes and this preempts their liability. The Court refuted this understanding.<blockquote>I conclude that Canada is not a manufacturer under the Act. Indeed, holding Canada accountable under the CRA would defeat the legislature's intention of transferring the health-care costs resulting from tobacco related wrongs from taxpayers to the tobacco industry. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider Canada's arguments that it would in any event be immune from liability under the provincial Act.</blockquote>The Court allowed British Columbia's claim against several tobacco companies to proceed, but did not rule on the merits of it. This has opened the door for suits from all the provinces worth potentially billions of dollars of damages against the tobacco industry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

security underwriters acted in violation of the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sa33.pdf">Securities Act of 1933</a> and the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [texts, PDF].

The investors incurred losses when Lehman went bankrupt in 2008. <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] Judge Lewis Kaplan allowed a majority of the claims to proceed, but determined that the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue with respect to fifty principal protection notes (PPNs), a type of structured security. Kaplan also dismissed several of the plaintiffs' claims against <a href="http://www.ey.com/">Ernst &#38; Young LLP</a> [corporate website], Lehman's independent auditor, but rejected the defendant's motion to dismiss claims that Ernst &#38; Young knew that Lehman was using repurchasing agreements.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontepa.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href = "http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] <a href = "http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/bd4379a92ceceeac8525735900400c27/8688682fbbb1ac65852578db00690ec5!OpenDocument">introduced</a> [press release] a <a href = "http://epa.gov/airquality/oilandgas/actions.html">proposal of new regulations</a> [materials] on Thursday to reduce the air pollution left from gas and oil drilling operations. The new standards are updated to include wells that are hydraulically fractured as well as several other technological advancements that cause pollution. The proposal will update four sets of regulations, some that have not been updated since 1985: the <A href = "http://www.epa.gov/oecaerth/monitoring/programs/caa/newsource.html">New Source Performance Standards</a>, <a href = "http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/hazard/tsd/td/combust/index.htm">Maximum Achievable Control Technology</a> (MACT) [texts] standards, as well as updating two regulations that apply to glycol dehydrators. If enacted, the proposal is estimated to save $30 million by being able to conserve methane gas more effectively.<blockquote>Today's proposal would cut smog-forming volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from several types of processes and equipment used in the oil and gas industry, including a 95 percent reduction in VOCs emitted during the completion of new and modified hydraulically fractured wells. This dramatic reduction would largely be accomplished by capturing natural gas that currently escapes to the air and making that gas available for sale through technologies and processes already in use by several companies and required in some states.</blockquote>The proposal is on a court mandate from January 2009, when the EPA settled a <a href = "http://www.wildearthguardians.org/support_docs/complaint_CAA_1_09.pdf">suit</a> [complaint text, PDF] brought by <a href = "http://www.wildearthguardians.org/">WildEarth Guardians</a> and <a href = "http://www.sanjuancitizens.org/">San Juan Citizens Alliance</a> [advocacy websites]. The suit alleged that the EPA was not protecting people from the harmful air pollutants released by gas and oil drilling, and what little regulations they had in place were outdated. WildEarth Guardians <a href = "http://www.wildearthguardians.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=7075&news_iv_ctrl=1194">announced their approval</a> [press release] of the new measures, saying: "This proposed protection would help reign in life-threatening pollution from gas drilling for the first time and is a significant step forward in cleaning up a dirty industry." The proposal will undergo three public hearings in Dallas, Texas, Denver, Colorado and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The finals rules must be published by February 28, 2012, under court order.

<p>The EPA has made several efforts at containing air pollution. In March, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] upheld the EPA's approval of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/federal-appeals-court-upholds-epa-cap-on-vehicle-emissions.php">caps on motor vehicle emissions in California</a> [JURIST report]. The year before, the EPA <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/epa-proposes-stricter-smog-regulations.php">proposed stricter smog standards</a> [JURIST report] that would replace the Bush administration's broader <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/standards.html">2008 national smog regulations</a> [text], complying with scientific recommendations. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/dc-circuit-strikes-down-epa-ban-on.php">vacated a 2006 EPA rule</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting state and local governments from monitoring air pollution below acceptable levels set by the EPA for "stationary" sources such as power plants and factories. The court wrote that the rule violated <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sup_01_42_10_85_20_V.html">Title V of the Clean Air Act</a> [text] because the EPA's monitoring protocols themselves violated the Act, and because the rule prevented state and local governments from making up for its shortcomings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, until August 3. Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-postpones-questioning-after-mubarak-hospitalized.php">hospitalized in April</a> [JURIST report], just days before he was scheduled to appear before Egypt's public prosecutor for questioning about his alleged roles in protester deaths and embezzlement of government money.

Earlier this month, the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0174p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Proposal 2 was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-finds-michigan-affirmative-action-ban-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] because it unduly burdens minorities by abusing a political process where minorities are likely to have no redress. In his official statement <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/ag/0,1607,7-164--259992--,00.html">announcing</a> [press release] he would appeal the court's ruling, Schuette said Proposal 2: 
<blockquote>[E]mbodies the fundamental premise of what America is all about: equal opportunity under the law. . . Entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit. Today we will continue the fight for quality, fairness and the rule of law. . . It's absurd to conclude that banning racial discrimination somehow perpetuates racial discrimination. It simply defies common sense.</blockquote>
Schutte appealed the ruling by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/29/us-affirmative-action-michigan-idUSTRE76S55920110729">making a formal request</a> [Reuters report] to the Sixth Circuit for a rehearing en banc in front of the full 16 member court. He is arguing for rehearing under the premise that the current decision conflicts with prior decisions of the court.

<p>The Sixth Circuit's ruling reversed a 2008 decision by the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/michigan-affirmative-action-ban-ruled.php">dismiss the challenge</a> [JURIST report] with prejudice. District Court Judge David Lawson had found that Proposal 2 was "facially neutral" regarding racial discrimination and did not violate the US Constitution. Michigan voters <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/michigan-voters-approve-affirmative.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the constitutional amendment in November 2006, and it was initially expected to take effect in late December 2006. In December 2006, a federal judge ruled that the universities could <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/federal-judge-delays-michigan.php">delay implementing the proposal</a> [JURIST report] until the they had completed the 2006-2007 admission cycle under current procedures, but that order was later <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/06a0476p-06.pdf">stayed</a> [opinion, PDF] by the Sixth Circuit. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/supreme-court-declines-to-hear.php"> declined</a> [JURIST report] to consider whether the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University could delay implementing Proposal 2 in early 2007.<br />

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.pubpat.org/">Public Patent Foundation</a> (PUBPAT) [advocacy websites] originally <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-allows-challenge-to-human.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] the suit on behalf of patients and scientists challenging patents held by <a href="http://www.myriad.com/">Myriad Genetics</a> [corporate website] on the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA">BRCA genes</a> [NCI backgrounder]. Myriad Genetics appealed the lower court decision that <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-invalidates-patents-on.php">found the patents to be invalid</a> [JURIST report]. Federal Appeals <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/judges/alan-d-lourie-circuit-judge.html">Judge Alan Lourie</a> [official profile] wrote in the majority opinion: <blockquote>The ability to visualize a DNA molecule through a microscope, or by any other means, when it is bonded to other genetic material, is worlds apart from possessing an isolated DNA molecule that is in hand and usable. It is the difference between knowledge of nature and reducing a portion of nature to concrete form, the latter activity being what the patent laws seek to encourage and protect.</blockquote> The majority, however, ruled that Myriad Genetics may not patent its method of determining whether a gene had mutations because the analysis consists of non-patentable "abstract mental steps." The case may appear before the Supreme Court if appealed. 

<p>The court's decision countered the position held by the Obama administration, which submitted an <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/genepatents-USamicusbrief.pdf"><em>amicus curie</em> brief</a> [text, PDF] in support of the ACLU and PUBPAT. Nevertheless, the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> [official website] has issued patents for genes for decades. Such patents cover nearly 2,000 human genes and genetic research companies hold patents to approximately 20 percent of the human genetic code. Many of the patented genes are associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer. Supporters of the decision argue that restricting patents on human genes would decrease the amount of genetic research performed by the public sector because it would no longer be profitable for companies to study human genes. Currently, the holder of a gene patent can prevent others from studying the gene and can also develop testing for specific genetic mutations, which they can then market without direct competition. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision, issued on Wednesday, stems from a petition for federal habeas corpus relief filed by Mackle Shelton, which included a claim that Florida's <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0800-0899/0893/Sections/0893.13.html">Drug Abuse and Prevention statute </a> [&#167; 893.13, text] is "facially unconstitutional because it entirely eliminates mens rea as an element of a drug offense and creates a strict liability offense under which [Shelton] was sentenced to eighteen years in prison." The law was amended to its current form in 2002, making Florida the only state to have eliminated mens rea as an element of a drug offense. In her order, Judge Mary Scriven discussed a number of reasons why the law violated due process, writing: <blockquote>Florida's strict liability drug statute also runs afoul of due process limits when viewed from the perspective of the nature of the activity regulated. Where laws proscribe conduct that is neither inherently dangerous nor likely to be regulated, the Supreme Court has consistently either invalidated them or construed them to require proof of mens rea in order to avoid criminalizing "a broad range of apparently innocent conduct." Under this reasoning, not even a small criminal penalty may constitutionally be imposed without proof of guilty knowledge where the conduct at issue includes a wide array of innocuous behavior or behavior not inherently likely to be regulated."</blockquote>

<p>The state is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/us/28brfs-DRUGLAWSRULE_BRF.html">expected to appeal</a> [NYT report] the decision as it may affect hundreds of convictions as well as other pending cases.</p>

<p>Florida continues to see challenges to its seemingly harsh drug-related rules. Last month, the <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> (ACLUFL) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-aclu-challenges-mandatory-drug-screening-of-state-employees-applicants.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging an executive order that mandates state government agencies provide pre-employment drug screening for all prospective employees and provide for random drug testing of all current agency employees regardless of classification. <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] issued <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2011/11-58-testing.pdf">Executive Order 11-58</a> [text, PDF] in March and directed the drug testing policy to go into effect by May 21, 2011. The complaint was filed in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] on behalf of the <a href="http://www.afscmefl.org/">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 79</a> (AFSCME) [union website], a union representing 50,000 public workers affected by the order. In the complaint, the ACLUFL argues that the order violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable governmental searches and case law stating that drug-testing without suspicion is unreasonable except under certain circumstances, such as when employees are involved in "safety-sensitive" positions. The ACLUFL points out that the governor's reasoning behind the order was not to promote safety, but to exert control over employees in order to maintain discipline and lessen absenteeism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In June, Florida officials filed an application with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] seeking approval of the law. Browning has <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/state/does-new-florida-election-law-make-it-harder-1673290.html">withdrawn four sections of the law</a> [<em>Palm Beach Post</em> report] from consideration before the DOJ. The withdrawn sections are considered to be the most controversial sections of the law.  Five Florida counties require federal approval before they can administer the laws known as <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=46845&SessionId=66">HB 1355</a> [materials]. According to Browning,
<blockquote>The purpose of filing in the federal district court is to ensure that the changes to Florida's election law are judged on their merits by eliminating the risk of a ruling impacted by outside influence . . . Since the passage of HB 1355, we have seen misinformation surrounding the bill increase. By asking a court to rule on certain aspects of the bill, we are assured of a neutral evaluation based on the facts.</blockquote>
Browning is seeking a declaratory judgment from the federal court that the changes to the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Index&Title_Request=IX#TitleIX">Florida Election Code</a> [materials] comply with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/42usc/subch_ih.php">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [text]. Under the VRA, the changes may not deny or abridge the right to vote based on race, color or membership in a language minority. 

<p>The Florida <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] in May<a href="/paperchase/2011/05/florida-legislature-approves-election-law-revisions.php"> voted</a> [JURIST report] 77-38 to pass the controversial legislation revising the state's election laws, only hours after the <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] did so by a 25-13 margin. The bill limits the window for early voting to one week prior to an election, and imposes a series of additional regulations on organizations that enlist new voters, including that they register with the state, submit periodic reports and file voter registration materials within 48 hours of completion. Opponents to the legislation charge that its design is politically motivated to disproportionately affect Democratic constituencies, though its supporters argue that the measures are intended only to reduce election-related expenses and voter fraud. In June, the <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/">Florida American Civil Liberties Union</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-aclu-files-suit-challenging-state-election-law-changes.php">filed suit challenging the election </a>[JURIST report] law changes because they believe it will affect the voting ability of minorities.<br />

The lawsuit against the county was originally filed by three residents who felt that "the Board's legislative prayer policy did in fact violate the Establishment Clause [of the First Amendment] by advancing and endorsing Christianity to the exclusion of other faiths." While the Board had no official written policy concerning prayer prior to the suit being filed in 2007, for years it began its twice-monthly meetings with an invocation delivered by a local religious leader who was invited on a volunteer first-come, first-serve basis. The meetings in question are open to and attended by many of the county's approximately 350,000 residents. The invocation given at each meeting preceded the Pledge of Allegiance and nearly always included references to specific tenets of Christianity. Claiming to have attended or watched several Board meetings, the plaintiffs in the case requested and won both a declaratory judgment that the Board's sponsorship of sectarian prayers violated the Establishment Clause, and an injunction precluding sectarian prayers from future Board meetings. The 2-1 appellate decision was delivered in a lengthy analysis of the relevant facts and law, concluding,<blockquote>To plant sectarian prayers at the heart of local government is a prescription for religious discord. ... That the Board and religious leaders in Forsyth County hold steadfast to their faith is certainly no cause for condemnation. But where prayer in public fora is concerned, the deep beliefs of the speaker afford only more reason to respect the profound convictions of the listener. Free religious exercise posits broad religious tolerance. The policy here, as implemented, upsets the careful balance the First Amendment seeks to bring about.</blockquote>Soon after the suit was filed, the Board formalized its policy, codifying past practice but removing the invocation as an agenda item. The Board also clarified its policy goal that the hands-off approach toward booking the invocations is an expression of the Board's respect for the county's various denominations and faiths. The court found that in the year before the suit was filed at least half of the invocations concluded with references to Jesus.  Audio recordings confirm that after the Board implemented the new policy "almost four-fifths of the prayers referred to 'Jesus,' 'Jesus Christ,' 'Christ,' or 'Savior.' ... None of the prayers mentioned non-Christian deities."

<p>The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-appeals-court-rules-new-york-city-can-prohibit-school-worship-service.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in June that the <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/default.htm">New York City Department of Education</a> [official website] can enforce a rule prohibiting outside groups from using school facilities for after-school worship services. In April, Utah <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/my_mission.html">Attorney General Mark Shurtleff</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-rule-on-memorial-crosses.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Supreme+Court">news archive</a>] to decide whether crosses placed beside highways as memorials to deceased <a href="http://publicsafety.utah.gov/highwaypatrol/index.html">Utah Highway Patrol</a> (UHP) [official website] troopers is an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. The petition seeks review of an August 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/tenth-circuit-finds-memorial-crosses-along-highways-unconstitutional.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/clerk/opinions.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website], which found that "the cross memorials would convey to a reasonable observer that the state of Utah is endorsing Christianity."

Liu is currently serving an <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">11-year prison term</a> [JURIST report] after being convicted on charges of subversion in a trial that lasted only two hours and was closed to foreign diplomats. The Working Group forwarded its written opinions to the Chinese government calling Liu's detention "arbitrary" and in violation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. The documents said that the Chinese government responded saying the conviction was in accordance with Chinese criminal codes and consistent with the rule of law. But the Working Group disagreed saying that Liu should be immediately released and paid reparation:<blockquote>The total or partial non-observance of the relevant international standards in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to the right to a fair trial can be of such gravity so as to confer on the deprivation of liberty, of whatever kind, an arbitrary character. The trial was organized in way which constitutes a breach of fairness. In spite of the difficult balancing issues that are involved in free speech cases, Mr. Liu Xiaobo's defence was limited to 14 minutes. ... Restrictions of the right to political free speech are strongly circumscribed. The Government has not shown in this case a justification for the interference with Mr. Liu Xiaobo's political free speech. The requirement of proportionality which applies to such restrictions is not satisfied by the reasons provided by the Government.</blockquote>Liu has been one of China's most prominent dissidents. He spent two years in prison following the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder] uprising, has long challenged China's one-party rule and co-authored <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision_id=89851&item_id=85717">Charter 08</a> [text], a petition calling for political reforms in the country.

<p>Last December, Liu was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-awarded-nobel-peace-prize-in-absentia.php">awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize <em>in absentia</em></a> at a ceremony in Oslo, Norway after it was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">announced he would be the recipient</a> [JURIST reports] in October. The Chinese government denounced the decision calling it "contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Prize," and censoring the announcement, blocking internet searches and international broadcasts about it and even turning off phones of people who text messaged the news. China's human rights record has been widely criticized. In June, the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] urged the Chinese government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">release protesters arrested</a> [JURIST report] for the peaceful Tiananmen Square protests in June 1989. The DOS also asked the Chinese government to provide an account of those missing, detained or killed during the suppression. The US encouraged the Chinese government to protect universal human rights of peaceful dissenters and to release all that are detained, forcibly disappeared, or placed under house arrest in recent months. China has also been criticized for jailing human rights attorney <a href="http://www.freegao.com/">Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zhisheng">news archive</a>]. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/un-panel-urges-china-to-release-detained-human-rights-lawyer.php">called on the Chinese government</a> [JURIST report] in March to free him claiming his detention is in violation of international law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Varela, who was <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/95685-NN/chavez-designa-a-diputada-iris-varela-ministra-de-servicios-penitenciarios/">appointed</a> [<em>TeleSUR</em> report, in Spanish] to the position by Venezuelan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3517106.stm">President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Hugo+Chavez">news archive</a>] last week, said roughly 20,000 inmates who had committed minor crimes and who posed no danger to society <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14361079">would be conditionally released</a> [BBC report]. Prison authorities will begin determining which inmates could be eligible for release starting this week. Varela's appointment, as well as the latest measures to reduce prison overcrowding, come in response to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14146549">deadly uprising at El Rodeo prison</a> [BBC report] in Guatire, Venezuela. Over 25 people died during the June riot and stand-off when armed prisoners clashed with National Guard troops. Chavez has set aside nearly $100 million for reforming the Venezuelan prison system, which is notoriously overcrowded.

<p>Prison overcrowding is a problem faced by a number of countries around the world. California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] submitted a <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/6.7.11-Response-to-1.12.10-Order.pdf">plan</a> [press release] in June to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/california-submits-plan-to-reduce-prison-population-to-meet-court-order.php">reduce the state's prison population</a> [JURIST report] by over 30,000 inmates to satisfy a court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judges-order-california-to.php">order</a> [JURIST report] to reduce overcrowding. Canada allocated $105 million in September 2010 to build new prison cells at four existing prisons in anticipation of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/canada-to-spend-105-million-on-prison-expansions-in-anticipation-of-prisoner-increase.php">drastic increase in prisoners</a> [JURIST report] over the next several years. In September 2008, UN Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sga1147.doc.htm">Patricia O'Brien</a> [appointment release] found that prison overcrowding in countries with UN peacekeeping missions <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/prison-overcrowding-threatens.php">threatens the success of those missions</a> [JURIST report]. The government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> [JURIST news archive] announced plans to release certain inmates in <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/bangladesh-to-free-prisoners-early-to.php">June 2008</a> and later in <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bangladesh-to-release-1000-inmates-to-relieve-prison-overcrowding.php">August 2010</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in June 2008, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/courtsofappeal/3rdDistrict/">Third Appellate District of the California Court of Appeal</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-court-upholds-inmate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a plan to ease prison overcrowding by transferring prisoners to out-of-state facilities did not violate the state's <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">constitution</a> [text]. The UK has also instituted a plan to <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/some-uk-inmates-set-for-early-release.php">release inmates</a> ahead of schedule, and Iraq has experienced <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/iraqi-justice-system-overwhelmed-by.php">increasing overcrowding problems</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The trial will also be held at the national police academy in a room large enough to <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/08/01/Judge-Mubarak-trial-to-be-televised-live/UPI-68011312183800/">accommodate 600 people</a> [UPI report]. The judge did not indicate, however, whether Mubarak would be present for the trial. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-prosecutor-mubarak-to-stand-trial-could-face-death-penalty.php">faces several charges</a> [JURIST report], including murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">general abuse of power</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report], as a result of his response to pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year. Mubarak will face trial with his two sons, six deputies and a businessman who also face corruption charges. The trial date for Mubarak and the other men is set for <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/13429/Egypt/Politics-/Mubaraks-to-be-tried-on--August-for-corruption-and.aspx">August 3</a> [MENA report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/egypt-to-try-mubarak-in-august.php">report</a>].

<p>Officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place at a convention center in downtown Cairo. The announcement <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE76R1S820110728?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">came amid speculation</a> [Reuters report] that the trial would take place at a Red Sea resort because of Mubarak's alleged poor health. Many Egyptians contend that Mubarak is not ill and that members of the government have claimed the ex-president is sick in an effort to avoid a swift, public trial. Last week, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, until August 3. Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-postpones-questioning-after-mubarak-hospitalized.php">hospitalized in April</a> [JURIST report], just days before he was scheduled to appear before Egypt's public prosecutor for questioning about his alleged roles in protester deaths and embezzlement of government money. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters. <a href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report], and more than 6,000 were injured, during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge J Thomas Marten <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/federal-judge-blocks-kan-law-stripping-planned-parenthood-chapter-of-federal-funding/2011/08/01/gIQAQavTnI_story.html">issued a temporary injunction</a> [AP report] preventing the health centers from losing funding. PPKM <a href="http://caminopr.org/pr_images/PPFA/Kansas%20Complaint.pdf">filed the lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in June alleging that the HB 2014 violates the Supremacy Clause and the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it imposes additional restrictions on qualifying for funding than federal law requires and impermissibly harms PPKM's right to advocate for <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] services or interfere with patients right to seek such services. PPKM argued that without the injunction blocking HB 2014 from taking effect, it would cause irreparable harm because it would be forced to close centers and raise fees. 

<p>Last month, Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/index.htm">Attorney General Greg Zoeller</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/indiana-to-appeal-ruling-on-planned-parenthood-funding.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] to challenge a federal court judge's decision to issue a preliminary injunction blocking a similar Indiana law that would have defunded <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana</a> (PPIN) [advocacy website]. Kansas currently has multiple suits challenging new abortion restrictions. Earlier this month, another judge for the US District Court for the District of Kansas <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-abortion-law-requiring-licenses-for-clinics.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], in a lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website], to block another Kansas regulation requiring clinics within the state to obtain a license to perform abortions. Without the injunction, two of Kansas' three abortion clinics would have been forced to close for failure to meet the new requirements for a license. Kansas is also among multiple states that have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cvetkovic <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/israel-to-extradite-bosnian-serb-over-srebrenica/">claims he did not participate</a> [Reuters report] in the massacre. Bosnia first asked Israel to extradite Cvetkovic, whom they claim was in the 10th Sabotage Detachment of the Army of Republika Srpska, in August 2010. He has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/israel-arrests-seeks-to-extradite-accused-bosnia-war-criminal.php">held in jail</a> [JURIST report] in Israel since January and will be extradited in 60 days if his lawyer does not appeal the ruling. 

<p>A number of cases have been opened in relation to the Bosnian Civil War. The <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=b">Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-police-officer-indicted-for-role-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">confirmed the indictment</a> [JURIST report] of former police officer Bozidar Kuvelja in March for his role in the 1995 massacre.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaustria.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] An Austrian court on Friday rejected Serbia's extradition request for former Bosnian general and suspected war criminal Jovan Divjak. The court ruled that Divjak likely <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/txdam/633c954da7d9434f9de7ed15f38075aa/Article_2011-07-29-EU-Austria-Divjak/id-98426b5da84c4d75a57c4706c9ef11f2">would not receive a fair trial</a> [AP report] if he were extradited, expressing concerns that Serb authorities would not have access to evidence or witness testimony of Bosnian authorities due to a lack of evidentiary laws between the nations. Austrian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/austria-police-arrest-former-bosnian-general-on-war-crimes-charges.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] Divjak in March under a 2008 international warrant issued by Serbian officials that accuses Divjak of war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnia+civil+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive]. He was taken into custody at Vienna International Airport while traveling from Sarajevo to Italy, and he appeared before a local judge who <a href="http://www.tanjug.rs/vest.asp?id=8884">placed him in extradition custody</a> [<em>Tanjug</em> report, in Serbian]. Serbian officials believe that Divjak was involved in a May 1992 attack that <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/pejic_bosnia_commentary/2328106.html">killed up to 40 retreating soldiers</a> [RFE/FL report] during the civil war. In a unique situation, Divjak, who is ethnically Serbian, left the Yugoslav army during the war and enlisted with the Bosnian forces. He has since <a href="http://nhjournal.com/2011/03/04/austria-detains-ex-bosnian-general-on-serb-warrant/">gained popularity</a> [AP report] in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for his belief in a "multiethnic Bosnia" and his charity work for children. Divjak is now free to leave the country.

<p>Some commentators predicted that Serbia would have difficulty extraditing Divjak from Austria, drawing parallels to the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-court-blocks-extradition-of-former-bosnia-president.php">failed extradition</a> [JURIST report] last year of former Bosnian president <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/index.php?id=801&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=ejup_ganic_919&amp;cHash=cc93a7abd0&amp;L=5">Ejup Ganic</a> [Trial Watch profile] from the UK to stand trial for alleged war crimes in Serbia. Divjak's arrest is part of Serbian officials' ongoing effort to apprehend those responsible for the atrocities that occurred in the region during the 1992-95 civil war. On Monday, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that suspected Bosnian war criminal Aleksander Cvetkovic <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/israel-to-extradite-war-crimes-suspect-to-bosnia.php">could be extradited</a> [JURIST report] to Bosnia to stand trial for crimes related to the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica Massacre</a> [JURIST news archive]. The <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=b">Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-police-officer-indicted-for-role-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">confirmed the indictment</a> [JURIST report] of former police officer Bozidar Kuvelja in March for his role in the 1995 massacre. In February, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/france-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-massacre-suspect.php">French authorities arrested Milorad Momic</a> [JURIST report] under an international arrest warrant for his suspected involvement in the massacre. The war crimes court <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?id=1867&amp;jezik=e">began trying four members of the 10th Sabotage Detachment</a> [press release] in December for genocide for their actions at Branjevo Farm after <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bosnia-court-indicts-military-officers-for-genocide-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">indicting them</a> [JURIST report] last August. Also in December, the war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/bosnia-war-crimes-court-sentences-serb-police-for-killing-muslim-civilians.php">found four policemen guilty</a> [JURIST report] of killing Muslim civilians during the Bosnian Civil War, handing them sentences ranging from 15 to 27 years in prison. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/bosnia-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-war-crimes-suspect.php">Prosecutors Office for BiH</a> [official website] announced in November that Dragan Crnogorac was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/bosnia-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-war-crimes-suspect.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on suspicion for having committed genocide under Article 171 of the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/bosnia-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-war-crimes-suspect.php">BiH criminal code</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gBSY7s-1lyx6lgcbobf8nu3XgV0A?docId=CNG.0d79a84244dc2d4f0de55e87d89bcbfb.61">law seems aimed at stopping numerous silent protests</a> [AFP report] across Belarus with protestors meeting in large groups chanting, clapping hands or standing around silently. Opposition members are against the new bill but they are not represented in Parliament, meaning the measure will likely pass. Taking part in unsanctioned protests is illegal in Belarus so <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/even-a-picnic-in-the-park-may-be-declared-illegal-in-belarus/441353.html">protests are being organized largely through social media sites</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] where the protestors meet at a previously agreed upon location and, for instance, clap hands. Many of the protests are aimed at <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">President Alexander Lukashenko</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Lukashenko">news archive</a>] who has been in power for 17 years since his 1994 election. The protests are usually broken up by police and many involved have been arrested. 

<p>Lukashenko cracked down on opposition presidential candidates and detained protestors during his bid for a third term in the last election. Earlier this year, Belarus' Minsk City Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-delivers-suspended-sentences-to-2-presidential-candidates-for-inciting-riots.php">delivered suspended sentences</a> of two former presidential candidates, Uladzimer Nyaklyaeu and Vital Rymasheuski, convicted of organizing <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/us-and-eu-condemn-arrests-and-violence-after-belarus-elections.php">protests following the re-election</a> [JURIST reports] of Lukashenko. The <a href = "http://www.rferl.org/content/eu_belarus_sanctions_lukashenka_opposition_trials/24180855.html">two-year suspended sentences</a> [RFE/RL report] were handed down days after former presidential candidate <a href = "http://www.freebelarusnow.org/en/component/k2/item/43?ml=1">Andrey Sannikau</a> [Free Belarus Now profile] was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-presidential-candidate-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-inciting-riots.php">sentenced to five years</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <A href = "/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports]. While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US State Department has historically <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [JURIST report].

It is up to the Iraqi Parliament to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/mullen-urges-iraq-to-decide-soon-on-troops-status/2011/08/02/gIQA5ri3oI_story.html">decide whether they still need a US presence</a> [WP report] beyond the deadline, but Mullen stressed that the agreement must contain immunity from prosecution. US troops are scheduled for complete withdrawal by December 31. But granting the immunity is a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/02/us-iraq-usa-idUSTRE7711PX20110802">controversial issue</a> [Reuters report] for Iraqi lawmakers, and a debate is scheduled for Tuesday. Tensions remain from a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">2007 shooting incident</a> [JURIST report] where as many as 14 Iraqi civilians were allegedly killed by US government contractors working for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blackwater">Blackwater USA</a> [JURIST news archive] now known as Xe Services. The contractors were immune from prosecution in Iraq under the US agreement with the Iraq government. Still, an agreement may be avoided if it is determined that only a small force of trainers are required to remain. 

<p>US troops and contractors have been tried in US courts for incidents occurring overseas. In June, four former Blackwater contractors allegedly involved in the 2007 shooting incident <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/blackwater-guards-challenge-reinstatement-of-manslaughter-case.php">challenged</a> a ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-case-against-blackwater-guards.php">reinstating the manslaughter case</a> [JURIST reports] against them. The case had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] because it found the decision to prosecute the men was "tainted" by the use of immunized statements. Two ex-Blackwater contractors were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-blackwater-contractors-convicted-of-manslaughter-for-afghan-shootings----dnp.php">convicted of manslaughter</a> [JURIST report] in March for their role in the May 2009 shooting deaths of two Afghan nationals and the wounding of a third. Last April, a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-blackwater-executives-indicted.php">indicted five former Blackwater executives</a> [JURIST report] on charges of weapons violations and lying to investigators. In February 2010, the Iraqi government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">ordered 250 former Blackwater employees to leave Iraq</a> [JURIST report] in reaction to the dismissal of charges against the ex-Blackwater employees allegedly involved in the September 2007 shootings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontimmigration.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Monday filed a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/U.S.%20Justice%20Department%20lawsuit.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] in the US <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] challenging an Alabama <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">law</a> [HB 56 text] that expands restrictions on undocumented immigrants. The DOJ contends that various provisions of the Alabama immigration legislation are preempted by federal law and violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the Constitution. Specifically, the measures that permit police officers to detain a person stopped for a traffic violation if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the country illegally, the DOJ argues, are unconstitutional. The DOJ also maintains that the state legislation disrupts the balance of federal interests in regulating immigration. <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Secretary Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] said the state's immigration law conflicts with federal law and its <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/August/11-ag-993.html">enforcement requires significant resources</a> [DOJ press release]:<blockquote>DHS continues to enforce federal immigration laws in Alabama and around the country in smart, effective ways that focus our resources on criminal aliens and employers who knowingly hire illegal labor, as well as continue to secure our border. Legislation like this diverts critical law enforcement resources from the most serious threats to public safety and undermines the vital trust between local jurisdictions and the communities they serve. We continue to support comprehensive reform of our immigration system at the federal level because this challenge cannot be solved by a patchwork of inconsistent state laws.</blockquote>The DOJ expressed similar sentiments in its complaint. The DOJ is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the law from taking effect on September 1.

<p>The Alabama immigration legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] in June, is one of the most rigid immigration reform laws passed recently. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. A group of immigrants <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/alabama-immigration-law-challenged-in-state-court.php">filed a lawsuit in an Alabama state court</a> [JURIST report] just last week arguing that the Alabama immigration law conflicts with the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/ACASLoginMac.asp">Alabama Constitution</a> [text], which expressly encourages immigration. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.hispanicinterest.org/">Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama</a> (HICA) [advocacy websites] and several other civil rights groups jointly <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-seek-to-bar-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/motion_for_pi_-final.pdf">motion for preliminary injunction</a> [text, PDF] earlier in July in an effort to prevent the Alabama immigration law from taking effect.

Zoeller filed the appeal in the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] challenging the decision of Judge Tanya Walton Pratt that prevents application of the portion of the law that bans contracts between state agencies and any entity that performs <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive] or maintains a facility where abortions are performed. Indiana <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/indiana-to-appeal-ruling-on-planned-parenthood-funding.php">filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] in June. Indiana argues that PPIN cannot force the state to fund medical centers under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1396a.html">"free-choice plan requirement"</a> [42 USC &#167; 1396a(a)(23)] that gives patients the right to choose their healthcare provider, because the state has the authority to determine what are qualified healthcare providers:<blockquote>When Congress enacted Medicaid, it did not create a top-down welfare model where the national government commandeers a State administrative apparatus and instructs it to provide particular benefits through prescribed channels.  Rather, it created a cooperative-federalist program offering federal reimbursement to States that choose to establish Medicaid programs that comply with federal criteria. Under this model, States decide what services and segments of the population they want to cover and determine the qualifications and standards of practice for those who seek to provide the covered services. The federal government reimburses States whose Medicaid plans conform to the Medicaid Act and may refuse to issue grants to States with non-compliant plans. ... Accordingly, PPIN cannot have a right of action to "enforce" ... the "free-choice plan requirement." All concede that the Medicaid Act itself affords no right of action.</blockquote> Zoeller <a href="http://www.in.gov/portal/news_events/files/8-1-11_Attorney_General_sound_bite.wav">said that the issue is between the state and federal government</a> [audio statement] and not between the state and private contractor, so it should be resolved through the administrative review process already in place. PPIN and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed the lawsuit challenging HEA 1210 seeking a permanent injunction of the law. 

<p>Indiana is already appealing an administrative decision in June by Donald Berwick, administrator of the <a href="http://www.cms.gov/">US Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services</a> (CMMS) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">deny approval of the law</a> [JURIST report]. He sent a letter to the Indiana state agency saying states have the ability to assign the qualified provider status, but the law violates <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1902.htm">&#167; 1902(a)(23) of the Social Security Act</a> [text] because it prevents Medicaid beneficiaries from receiving services from certain providers for reasons unrelated to the providers qualifications to provide those services. The Obama administration has taken a stance against the Indiana law. In addition to the CMMS denial, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a brief <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-indiana-ban-on-medicaid-funds-to-abortion-providers-violates-federal-law.php">urging the court to grant an injunction</a> [JURIST report] to stop the enforcement of the law. The ban includes disbursement of grant money, including federal Medicare funds, a provision PPIN claims is not legal under the federal Medicaid Act's "freedom of choice" provision, which allows states to disallow Medicare funding for medical providers based on deficiencies in quality of service. Before granting the preliminary injunction, the judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-indiana-planned-parenthood-cuts.php">denied a request for a restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to block implementation of the law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A federal judge on Tuesday ruled that the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] was <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/court-sanctions-cia-pay-fees-over-torture-tapes">not in contempt of court for destroying videotapes</a> [press release] thought to have shown harsh interrogations of terror suspects, but ordered the CIA to pay attorneys fees to the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. The ACLU argued during a court hearing that the CIA "showed complete disdain for the court and the rule of law itself" when it destroyed the videotapes after being ordered to produce them. Though he denied the contempt motion, Judge Alvin Hellerstein of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/08/01/cia.aclu.ruling/">praised the ACLU</a> [CNN report] for ultimately triggering the disclosure of thousands of documents detailing treatment of detainees. The ACLU expressed disappointment with the judge's rejection of the contempt motion, but emphasized the importance of holding government officials accountable for their actions:<blockquote>Though the Court's sanctioning of the CIA is a positive step for accountability, it falls short of the full accounting necessary before we can turn the page on the last decade. Far more disturbing than the CIA's destruction of the tapes is the CIA's authorization of the brutal mistreatment captured by the tapes. By destroying that evidence of criminal activity in direct violation of the judge's clear instructions, the agency's top officials aimed to deny the public and the courts the chance to hold them accountable.</blockquote>Hellerstein also asked the CIA to publish its policies regarding document destruction, which have been proposed in response to the video destruction litigation.

<p>In January, Hellerstein told the CIA that it must <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-tells-cia-to-investigate-destruction-of-interrogation-tapes.php">investigate the destruction of the interrogation tapes</a> [JURIST report] related to individuals detained after <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Internal CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p01-09.pdf">documents</a> [part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p10-18.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">part 3</a>, PDF] released last April reveal that the former head of the agency Porter Goss may have <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cia-documents-reveal-possible-cover-up.php">agreed to the destruction</a> [JURIST report] of the interrogation <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive]. According to redacted <a href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/030609/paragraph_77.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF] filed in March 2009, 12 of 92 videotapes <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">destroyed by the CIA</a> [JURIST report] contained evidence of "enhanced interrogation techniques." The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">acknowledged</a> [letter, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">report</a>] in March 2009 that the CIA destroyed 92 videotapes of high value terrorism suspect interrogations, in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information. The August 2008 order came in response to a December 2007 ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/aclu_v_dod_memo_contemptmotion.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA be held in contempt of court for not providing information on the tapes during a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/amended-foia-redlined-2010.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/accountability/released.html">lawsuit</a> [ACLU materials] brought by the organization in an effort to access government materials on the interrogations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontimmigration.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.casademaryland.org/home">Casa de Maryland</a> [advocacy website] immigrant rights group <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/61389335/Doe-Et-Al-v-MD-Bd-of-Elections">filed a challenge</a> [brief] Monday to a public referendum over a Maryland law providing in-state tuition to undocumented college students. The group filed the challenge in the Maryland <a href="http://www.circuitcourt.org/">Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County</a> [official website] after opponents of the Maryland <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/2011rs/bills/sb/sb0167f.pdf">DREAM Act</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/2011rs/billfile/sb0167.htm">materials</a>] collected enough signatures to put the law to a public referendum. Casa de Maryland and eight other individuals are challenging the referendum for two main reasons. First, they argue that the DREAM Act will result in state tax money going to fund the tuition breaks making it an appropriations measure not subject to repeal by referendum. Second, they argue that over 57,000 signatures on the petition for the referendum are invalid because of the computer system used to collect them. Many of the signatures were submitted through <a href="https://mdpetitions.com/">MDPetitions.com</a> [advocacy website], which downloads and prints a "Pre-Filled Petition" that only needs to be signed and mailed in. The website prints out the form with the voters' information exactly as it appears in their voter registration, necessary for the signature to be valid. But the plaintiffs argue that such a system is invalid because the petitions do not have sufficient verification to be valid under state law:<blockquote>There are sound policy reasons for requiring ... the petitioner signer to fill in his or her own information on the form, rather than allowing that information to be filled in by someone else. Anyone&#8212;including someone other than the voter&#8212;could have the website generate a "Pre-Filled Petition Form" with that voter's information pre-printed, both in the signing block and the circulators affidavit. The user (who is not the voter) could then print out the form, sign the voter's name in the signature space and in circulator's affidavit and mail the form to MDPetitions.com for submission to the Secretary of State and State Board.</blockquote>Supporters of the referendum <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-casa-lawsuit-20110801,0,3647139.story">collected over 100,000 signatures</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report] with broad bipartisan support: 63,487 Republicans, 32,397 Democrats and 12,628 independents. The DREAM Act narrowly passed the Maryland legislature in the final hours of the spring session. 

<p>The Maryland DREAM Act is currently suspended pending the public referendum. In order to be eligible for in-state tuition, undocumented residents would have to have attended at least three years of high school in Maryland and show their parents had filed tax returns to the state. The US Congress has considered a similar but more far-reaching <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN03827:">bill</a> [legislative materials; <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.424:">text</a>], also entitled the DREAM Act, that would provide a path to permanent resident status for some high school graduates who enter the military or enroll in a college degree program. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or DREAM Act, would amend the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ208.104.pdf">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996</a> [text, PDF] to allow certain children of illegal immigrants an opportunity to achieve legal residency. The bill was previously <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/bill-giving-children-of-illegal.php">defeated in Congress in 2007</a>, but <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/senators-introduce-immigration-reform-bill.php">reintroduced</a> [JURIST reports] last October by US Senators <a href="http://menendez.senate.gov/biography/">Robert Menendez</a> (D-NJ) and <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/biography/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official profiles] as part of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d111:1:./temp/~bdSUpF::|/home/LegislativeData.php|">Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2010</a> [legislative materials], which includes several bills that, if passed, would greatly change US <a href="/currentawareness/immigration.php">immigration</a> [JURIST news archive] law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Vu was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and an additional three years of house arrest after a trial that lasted only one day. Vu has been in prison since November because of interviews he gave to the international press in which he advocated for <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/lite/news/249928/vietnam-court-hears-top-dissident-appeal">elimination of the one-party political system</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] in Vietnam and championed other democratic reforms. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said the initial court proceedings <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/01/vietnam-ensure-fair-hearing-legal-scholar">violated Vu's rights</a> [press release] to due process and freedom of expression:<blockquote>Dr. Vu was jailed for political reasons in a trial that violated his rights. Vietnamese authorities should at least do the right thing now with a fair and independent appeals hearing. Rather than playing a revolving door game with peaceful government critics, this is an opportunity for the Appeals Court to correct the serious due process violations during Dr. Vu's trial in April and ensure that his appeal is in full accordance with fair trial standards.</blockquote> In 2009, Vu sued Vietnamese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5119642.stm">Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung</a> [BBC profile] in connection with a government initiative to develop, in collaboration with China, a bauxite mine. Vu is the son of Cu Huy Can, a leader in former Vietnamese president Ho Chi Minh's government and highly respected poet. 

<p>Vu is among several dissidents in Vietnam who have been convicted for anti-government activity. In January, a Vietnamese court sentenced former communist official Vi Duc Hoi to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy-activist-convicted-of-violating-national-security.php">eight years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for advocating democracy and a multi-party system. In January 2010, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to four years in prison on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. That same month, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion. Following the one-day trial, human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive] was sentenced to five years in prison. The four defendants were accused of activities aimed at ending communist rule in Vietnam. Dinh admitted to advocating multi-party democracy in Vietnam and joining the banned Democracy Party. Prior to Dinh's conviction, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] pro-democracy dissident Tran Anh Kim in December 2009 to five-and-a-half years in prison for subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.defence.lk/english.asp">Ministry of Defense</a> [official website] released its report Monday entitled, <a href="http://www.adaderana.lk/20110801_Conf.pdf">"Humanitarian Operation Factual Analysis"</a> [text, PDF], where for the first time it admitted that the military caused civilian deaths near the end of its 26-year civil war with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive]. The report details numerous alleged abuses of LTTE against civilians including using them as human shields. Sri Lanka says it took reasonable steps to protect avoid civilian casualties. <a href="http://www.defence.lk/main_abt.asp?fname=SoD">Secretary of Defence Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20110801_04">in releasing the report said</a> [press release]: "The false claims and allegations made by Tamil Diaspora together with the LTTE international network will be laid to rest with the release of the factual analysis reports." The report says:<blockquote>The Government of Sri Lanka made every effort to protect civilians in the conflict zone through the creation of Safe Corridors and No Fire Zones, and by adhering to a "Zero Civilian casualty" policy that had been conveyed to all troops through repeated training and operation orders. Sri Lanka also took a proactive and extensive role in delivering humanitarian assistance to these civilians before, during and after the fighting. Despite the clear intent of the Government of Sri Lanka and the precautions taken, it was impossible in a battle of this magnitude, against a ruthless opponent actively endangering civilians, for civilian casualties to be avoided.</blockquote> Still, HRW criticized the report for its lack of discussion over the military's responsibility for alleged war crimes such as "frequent indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas" and summary executions of LTTE fighters. Brad Adams, Asia director at HRW, said: "The Sri Lankan government is finally admitting that its forces caused civilians losses during the conflict's final months, but unconvincingly claims no responsibility. This is just the latest and glossiest effort to whitewash mounting evidence of government atrocities during the fighting." 

<p>There is a growing number of claims that Sri Lanka was responsible for war crimes during the war with the LTTE. In May, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial killings <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Christof Heyns</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-expert-confirms-authenticity-of-sri-lanka-war-crimes-video.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] to conduct further investigations into possible Sri Lankan war crimes after reconfirming the legitimacy of a video of LTTE members being executed by members of the Sri Lankan military. Heyns' conclusions were based on analysis by technical and forensic experts, including pathologists, video analysts and a firearms expert, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-expert-urges-sri-lanka-war.php">echo findings</a> [JURIST report] that led his predecessor last year to call for an independent investigation into Sri Lankan war crimes. In April, a UN panel of experts said in a report that parties on <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">both sides may have committed war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the final stages of the 26-year civil war. The Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.mea.gov.lk/">Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced in December that the three-person panel would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to investigate alleged war crimes. The decision represented a reversal after months of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government under <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/index.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who described the UN panel as an infringement on Sri Lanka's sovereignty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Magnitsky was arrested on allegations of tax fraud after implicating Russian police in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal while working as outside counsel for the London-based investment fund <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Management</a> [corporate website]. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/russia_reopens_magnitsky_fraud_probe/24284398.html">resurrected the case</a> [RFE/FL report] against Magnitsky following a June ruling by the Russian <a href="http://www.ksrf.ru/Pages/Default.aspx">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Russian] that permits criminal cases to be <a href="http://www.ksrf.ru/News/Pages/ViewItem.aspx?ParamId=891">filed against suspects who are already dead</a> [press release, in Russian]. The Russian <a href="http://www.mvdrf.ru/">Ministry of the Interior</a> (MOI) [official website, in Russian], however, has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russian-ministry-refuses-to-pursue-magnitsky-case/2011/08/02/gIQAHyk6oI_story.html">refused to open an investigation</a> [WP report] into the treatment of Magnitsky at the Russian prison.

<p>Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] announced in June that Magnitsky's pre-trial death was the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-president-medvedev-admits-jailed-lawyer-was-beaten-to-death.php">result of criminal acts</a> [JURIST report] and not attributable to the denial of medical treatment from prison doctors. Medvedev was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5joyDWZOSrwmRBeOTY6QCVe0mWk-w?docId=CNG.9dbab75e3418bf50a4b7b8244b8b6207.2a1">presented with a report</a> [AFP report] on Magnitsky's death during a <a href="http://kremlin.ru/news/11838">meeting</a> [press release, in Russian] with the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights that said Magnitsky was beaten to death by prison guards before his death. Prior to his death, Magnitsky was held in prison for 358 days with little to no access to legal representation, his family or medical professionals. In February, the Council began investigating Magnitsky's death and the verdicts handed down against former Russian oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] and his business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website]. The Council's goal is to submit to Medvedev, "expert legal analysis in connection with specific cases causing public outcry or defining trend of judicial practice." The Council began its work shortly after a group of independent UN human rights experts started its own investigation into the circumstances around Magnitsky's death. Last year, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/us-lawmakers-seek-to-ban-visas-for-russia-officials-linked-to-lawyers-death.php">introduced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] from issuing visas to individuals, or their family members, who are connected to Magnitsky's death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Women who violate the ban would <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/international/2011/August/international_August103.xml&section=international">face fines</a> [AP report] of 100 to 300 euros. The ban would also punish individuals who force women to conceal their faces in public, instituting a fine against violators of 30,000 euro and up to 12 months in prison. Supporters of the ban say the new law will help Islamic women assimilate to Italian society, while opponents contend that the ban will "isolate devout Muslim women" who will be obligated to stay at home. Parliament will vote on the law after summer recess.

<p>Italy is not the first EU country to enact legislation banning the wearing of full face veils in public. Last week, Belgium implemented a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-burqa-ban-takes-effect.php">banning women from wearing the burqa</a> [JURIST report] in public, with violators facing the possibility of fines or up to seven days in jail. A French Muslim couple living in the UK <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-muslim-couple-to-challenge-burqa-ban-in-echr-spain-court-uupholds-city-ban.php">filed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] in June in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] over the French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/dissimulation_visage_espace_public.asp">ban</a> [materials, in French] on full face coverings. Also in June, a Spanish court upheld a city ban on veils in municipal buildings for identification and security purposes. In October, the French Constitutional Council ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ban conforms with the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Also in October, Dutch politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=103">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website, in Dutch] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition. In August 2010, Austria's conservative <a href="http://www.fpoe.at/">Freedom Party</a> [official website, in German] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/conservative-austria-party-calls-for-vote-to-ban-minarets-face-veils.php">special vote</a> [JURIST report] on whether to ban face veils and the construction of minarets, two of the most visible symbols of the Islamic faith. In July 2010, Spain's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/spain-lower-house-rejects-proposal-to-ban-burqa.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to ban the burqa and other full face veils by a vote of 183 to 162 with two abstaining.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He argues that corruption cases in the regular courts <a href="http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/ebonyi-asks-fg-to-establish-anti-graft-courts/">take too long to process</a> [<em>Vanguard</em> report] causing people to forget about them, perpetuating the appearance of corruption in the government. He proposed merging the <a href="http://www.icpc.gov.ng/">Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission</a> (ICPC), which investigates corruption, and the <a href="http://www.efccnigeria.org/">Economic and Financial Crimes Commission</a> (EFCC) [official websites], which prosecutes financial crimes, to form an anti-corruption court. Corruption remains a problem in Nigeria as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/nigeria-anti-corruption-agency-arrests-outgoing-house-speaker-on-fraud-allegations.php">EFCC arrested</a> [JURIST report] outgoing speaker of the House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole in June on allegations of fraud. He is believed  to have secured a USD $ 66 million loan on top of his normal salary. 

<p>Nigerian elections also have not proceeded without significant problems. Last month, Nigerian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12192152">President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=goodluck+jonathan">news archive</a>] announced his intentions to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/nigeria-president-pushes-for-longer-presidency-term.php">propose a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] that would provide a single, extended tenure for the president of Nigeria and its 36 governors. In March, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.nba.org.ng/">Nigerian Bar Association</a> [association website] called for Nigeria's National Assembly to pass legislation <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/13/nigeria-pass-bill-prosecute-electoral-abuses">creating a special electoral offenses commission</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/nigeria-legislature-urged-to-create-special-electoral-offences-commission.php">report</a>] tasked with investigating and prosecuting election-related abuses, including violence. In 2006, Nigerian Vice-President <a href="http://www.nigeria.gov.ng/TheVicePresident.aspx">Atiku Abubakar</a> [official profile; <a href="http://www.atikuabubakar.net">official website</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/nigerian-vp-charged-with-corruption.php">charged with more than a dozen counts of corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the Code of Conduct Tribunal, a special corruption court that has the power to strip elected officials of immunity.

Mubarak is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-prosecutor-mubarak-to-stand-trial-could-face-death-penalty.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">general abuse of power</a> [Al Jazeera report] stemming from his response to pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year. He is on trial with his two sons, six deputies and a businessman who also face corruption charges. His sons, Gamal and Alaa, also pleaded not guilty to the charges. The judge postponed the trial of Mubarak and his sons until August 15 so that Mubarak can be treated by an oncologist at a military hospital. Those not related to Mubarak will continue their trials Thursday. Mubarak, although reportedly ill after <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-postpones-questioning-after-mubarak-hospitalized.php">hospitalization in April</a> [JURIST report], was described as looking <A href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/08/20118310525602786.html">surprisingly healthy and alert</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The defense asked that they be allowed to call Field Marshal <a href = "http://www.mmc.gov.eg/Commanders/general/default.htm">Mohamed Hussein Tantawi</a> [official profile], Egypt's current defense minister and Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, as a witness at trial. Tantawi is the temporary head of state, and was commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces at the time of the uprising. It appears Mubarak's team will allege that all of the violence against protesters arose under Tantawi's orders, not Mubarak's.

<p>Officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place at a convention center in downtown Cairo. The trial will also be <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-to-be-televised.php?">televised internationally</a> [JURIST report]. The announcement <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE76R1S820110728?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">came amid speculation</a> [Reuters report] that the trial would take place at a Red Sea resort because of Mubarak's alleged poor health. Many Egyptians contend that Mubarak is not ill and that members of the government have claimed the ex-president is sick in an effort to avoid a swift, public trial. Last week, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, until Wednesday. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters. <a href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report], and more than 6,000 were injured, during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontvietnam.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A Vietnamese appeals court on Tuesday upheld the seven-year sentence of prominent rights lawyer and dissident Cu Huy Ha Vu, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/vietnam-rights-lawyer-jailed-after-calling-for-government-reform.php">convicted in April</a> [JURIST report] of carrying out anti-state propaganda. The court <a href="http://www.macon.com/2011/08/02/1652056/vietnam-dissident-calls-for-reforms.html">dismissed the appeal</a> [AP report] despite Vu's arguments that his advocating for a multi-party system did not mean he was against the Communist party. Vu said he only advocated for a system of competitive ideas to better suit the needs and desires of the people of Vietnam. But prosecutors argued that he abused the freedom of speech. The decision comes just one day after the appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/vietnam-court-hears-appeal-of-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">began hearing arguments</a> [JURIST report] in Vu's appeal. Vu has been in prison since November because of interviews he gave to the international press in which he advocated for <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/lite/news/249928/vietnam-court-hears-top-dissident-appeal">elimination of the one-party political system</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] in Vietnam and championed other democratic reforms. Vu was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and an additional three years of house arrest after a trial that lasted only one day. Vu, educated in France, is the son of Cu Huy Can, a leader in former Vietnamese president Ho Chi Minh's government and highly respected poet. In 2009, Vu sued Vietnamese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5119642.stm">Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung</a> [BBC profile] in connection with a government initiative to develop, in collaboration with China, a bauxite mine. 

<p>Vu's sentence drew the criticism of rights groups around the world. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/01/vietnam-ensure-fair-hearing-legal-scholar">said Tuesday</a> [press release] that, "[Vu] was jailed for political reasons in a trial that violated his rights. Vietnamese authorities should at least do the right thing now with a fair and independent appeals hearing. Rather than playing a revolving door game with peaceful government critics, this is an opportunity for the Appeals Court to correct the serious due process violations during Dr. Vu's trial in April and ensure that his appeal is in full accordance with fair trial standards." He is among several dissidents in Vietnam who have been convicted for anti-government activity. In January, a Vietnamese court sentenced former communist official Vi Duc Hoi to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy-activist-convicted-of-violating-national-security.php">eight years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for advocating democracy and a multi-party system. In January 2010, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to four years in prison on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. That same month, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion. Following the one-day trial, human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive] was sentenced to five years in prison. The four defendants were accused of activities aimed at ending communist rule in Vietnam. Dinh admitted to advocating multi-party democracy in Vietnam and joining the banned Democracy Party. Prior to Dinh's conviction, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] pro-democracy dissident Tran Anh Kim in December 2009 to five-and-a-half years in prison for subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] also filed a <a href="http://www.politico.com/static/PPM191_110801_fazaga.html">motion to dismiss claims and for summary judgment</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] claiming that without the privileged information many of the claims against the FBI could not continue. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://ca.cair.com/"> Council on American-Islamic Relations of California</a> (CAIR) [advocacy websites] brought a <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0811/Obama_admin_asserts_state_secrets_privilege_to_dismiss_Muslims_suit.html">lawsuit on behalf of three Muslim individuals</a> [Politico report] in California against the FBI alleging that during its "Operation Flex," FBI investigators infiltrated mosques and indiscriminately collected information on innocent Muslims simply because they were Muslim. The plaintiffs are bringing the claim under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1985.html">42 USC &#167; 1985(3)</a> [text] alleging the investigation violated their civil rights including the First Amendment Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the Fourth Amendment, the Privacy Act and the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act. They sought to obtain as evidence classified statements by Mark Giuliano, Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division. Holder filed a declaration formally invoking the state secrets privilege: <blockquote>After careful and actual personal consideration of the matter, I have concluded that disclosure of the three categories of information described below and in more detail in the classified Giuliano Declaration could reasonably be expected to cause significant harm to the national security, and I therefore formally assert the state secrets privilege over this information.</blockquote>Holder said the statements could confirm or deny targets of counterterrorism investigations, methods used and confidential sources, which would harm national security. He attached a 2009 memorandum that set policies and procedures for the use of the privilege with the stated goal "to strengthen public confidence that the US Government will invoke the privilege in court only to the extent necessary to safeguard those interests."

<p>The FBI has come under controversy for its investigation of Muslims in the US before. In 2009, FBI Director <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/executives/director.htm">Robert Mueller</a> [official profile] said the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/fbi-head-defends-mosque-investigations.php">FBI will continue investigating mosques</a> [JURIST report] when there may be evidence or information regarding criminal wrongdoings after the <a href="http://www.ciomonline.org/">Council of Islamic Organizations of Michigan</a> [advocacy website] sent a complaint to Holder alleging the FBI had been asking members of the Islamic community to spy on religious leaders and followers. The alleged conduct might be allowable under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/readingroom/guidelines.pdf">attorney general's guidelines</a> [text, PDF] passed in 2008 governing FBI investigations, which rights groups say <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/37085res20081008.html">open the door to racial and religious profiling</a> [ACLU backgrounder]. In February, a man <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/26/local/me-informant26">claimed</a> [LAT report] that he had been commissioned by the FBI to infiltrate several Orange County mosques. The informant had provided information to the agency regarding Ahmadulla Sais Niazi, a Muslim man accused of lying about his ties to al Qaeda. Last year, the FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel08/mosque053008.htm">responded to criticism</a> [press release] regarding alleged investigations into mosques and the Muslim community claiming that "the FBI [does not] have a surveillance program to monitor the constitutionally protected activities of houses of worship." Although Mueller has <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fbi-director-defends-proposed.php">defended</a> the new attorney general guidelines as a "necessary step" in fighting terrorism, the proposed guidelines were <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/justice-department-to-amend-proposed.php">amended</a> [JURIST reports] by the DOJ last year before they came into effect to appease Congress and civil rights groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, approved by the <a href="http://www.suquamish.nsn.us/">Suquamish Tribe</a> [official website] council, <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/d9os8bg80/indian-tribe-in-washington-state-adopts-law-recognizing-gay-marriage-on-reservation.html">extends marriage rights</a> [AP report] to same-sex couples on the tribe's Seattle reservation. The tribe will be permitted to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples as long as each partner is at least 18 years old and one of the two is a member of the tribe. Same-sex marriage remains illegal in Washington, so the marriages may not be recognized by the state. The vote comes four years after a lesbian tribe member began her campaign for gay marriage on the reservation. The Coquille Indian Tribe in Oregon is the only other American Indian tribe to recognize same-sex marriage.

<p>New York began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples last week, just one month after <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">signed the legislation</a> [JURIST report] into law. Same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial and divisive issue through the US, although a recent <a href="http://people-press.org/2011/03/03/fewer-are-angry-at-government-but-discontent-remains-high/">poll</a> [materials] suggests support for legalization is growing. However, the <a href="http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/">Minnesota Senate</a> [official website] in May <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-senate-approves-referendum-on-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/revisor/pages/search_status/status_detail.php?b=Senate&amp;f=SF1308&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2011">voter referendum</a> [SF 1308 text] to amend the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In April, a Montana judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that had called for the state to provide legal status to same-sex relationships. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the state constitution that would ban same-sex marriage or any "substantially similar" status, and the <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Senate</a> [official website] in February approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">void in Wyoming any same-sex marriages and civil unions</a> [JURIST report] performed in other jurisdictions. In addition to New York, same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit will be filed <a href = "http://ca.news.yahoo.com/costa-ricas-vitro-fertilization-ban-challenged-205613620.html">on behalf of 50 Costa Rican couples</a> [AFP report] who have had to seek IVF procedures in other countries as a result of the ban. The <a href = "http://www.poder-judicial.go.cr/salaconstitucional/default.htm">Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href = "http://www.vidahumana.org/vidafam/repro/costarica-invitro.html">banned IVF</a> [judgment text, in Spanish] in 2000, declaring the practice unconstitutional because it violates an embryo's right to life. As a member of the IACHR, Costa Rica is bound by treaty expectations to follow any ruling they make. Last fall, the IACHR ruled in a separate case that IVF was a human right and that Costa Rica had to legalize it. The nation, since then, has received two extensions to legalize the medical procedure. In April, the IACHR threatened international penalties if the order was not followed, which is what this suit will determine. President Laura Chinchilla attempted to legalize IVF in June, but her bill was narrowly defeated. The Costa Rican government, nonetheless, plans to defend the law.

<p>IVF is a type of fertility treatment for couples who have had difficulty conceiving children. Through IVF, a woman's eggs are removed and fertilized outside the body. Successfully fertilized embryos are then implanted into the woman for gestation. The rest are frozen or discarded, which the Catholic Church, Costa Rica and other organizations see as destruction of human life. Costa Rica is the only Western nation that bans the practice and has been under increasing criticism for that ruling. Although the nation is known for a progressive human rights and civil liberties record, the government usually holds to the Catholic Church's edicts on many social issues. Last August, the Supreme Court of Costa Rica ruled 5-2 to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/costa-rica-high-court-removes-same-sex-civil-unions-from-ballot.php">disallow a nationwide referendum</a> [JURIST report] on whether to recognize <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=civil+unions+-ACLU+-EU+-American">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive]. The referendum was to be on the ballot during the December municipal elections after qualifying for the ballot through a petition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hicks spent more than five years without trial in US custody after being captured in Afghanistan following the terror attacks of <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. He wrote an autobiography last year entitled "Guantanamo: My Journey," describing his tenure as a detainee. <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/sc">Supreme Court of New South Whales</a> [official website] Justice Peter Garling <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/judge-freezes-ex-gitmo-1070075.html">froze a trust fund account</a> [AP report] holding proceeds from the sales of an estimated 30,000 copies of the book. The Australian <a href="http://www.dpp.sa.gov.au/">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/australia-to-sue-ex-guantanamo-detainee-for-book-royalties.php">applied for a restraining order</a> [JURIST report] and an order to obtain the book's profits last month, claiming the profits constitute proceeds of a crime. Pursuant to Australian proceeds of crime law amendments <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/australia-would-change-law-to-bar-hicks.php">tailored specifically to the Hicks case</a> [JURIST report], the ex-detainee is not permitted to profit from his book. The case proceedings are scheduled to resume on August 16.

<p>Hicks <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/hicks-pleads-guilty-to-supporting.php">pleaded guilty</a> to a <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-re-charging-guantanamo-detainees.php">charge of providing material support</a> [JURIST reports] to terrorists at an appearance before a US military commission in March 2007 and was sentenced to nine months in prison. He was then <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/hicks-transferred-to-australia-to.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to a maximum security prison near his hometown of Adelaide, South Australia to serve the remainder of his nine-month prison sentence. Under the plea agreement, Hicks was required to state that he "has never been illegally treated" while being held as an enemy combatant by the US and that his detention was lawful pursuant to the laws of armed conflict. Hicks was also prohibited from having contact with the media for a period of one year, ordered not take any legal action against the United States for his treatment during his five-year detention, and required to turn over any profits from an eventual sale of his story to the Australian government. Hicks' detention and trial have been heavily criticized, with the Law Council of Australia, for example, calling Hicks' trial a <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/australia-lawyers-group-says-hicks.php">"charade"</a> [JURIST report]. JURIST Special Guest Columnist and former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser argued that Hicks' trial before a US military commission demonstrated the disturbing willingness of two allegedly democratic governments to abandon the rule of law for an expedient and evil purpose in his <a href="/forum/2007/04/us-australia-and-david-hicks-abandoning.php">op-ed</a> entitled "The US, Australia and David Hicks: Abandoning the Rule of Law."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Noriega faces charges of human rights violations in Panama for crimes allegedly committed during his 1981-1989 rule. He was already convicted on three counts of human rights violations <em>in absentia</em>, and each count carries a 20-year prison sentence. Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official profile, in Spanish] and Panamanian authorities have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/panama-to-seek-noriega-extradition-from.php">seeking Noriega's extradition</a>  [JURIST report] to face charges of human rights violations in Panama since April 2010.

Noriega, whose <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/noriega-money-laundering-trial-begins-in-france.php">trial began days earlier</a> [JURIST report], was convicted of laundering $3 million in drug profits by purchasing property in Paris. In April 2010, Noriega was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-extradites-noriega-to-france-on.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] from the US, where he had served a 17-year sentence on drug charges, after <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-judge-refuses-to-block-france.php">fighting extradition</a> [JURIST report] since 2007. The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-declines-to-reconsider.php">declined to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Noriega's petition to stop the extradition process.

The law will create a fund that could start dispensing money to victims as early as August 10. Although the government has initially agreed to contribute two trillion yen (USD $25.9 billion), damages are expected to run much higher than that. The bill will also financially support the <a href = "http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/index-e.html">Tokyo Electric Power Company</a> (TEPCO) [corporate website], maker of the defective reactors, to prevent the utility from dissolving. However, TEPCO must first submit a comprehensive restructuring plan as well as a proposal for allocation of the funds to victims. There is also a bill under consideration that would <a href = "http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110804a5.html">obligate the government to clear radioactive debris</a> [<em>Japan Times</em> report]. On Friday, the Japanese government <a href = "http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110730a1.html">officially shifted its energy policy</a> [<em>Japan Times</em> report] away from nuclear energy.

<p>The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 is considered one of the biggest man-made environmental disasters of all time and the largest nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Following the 9.0 magnitude Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, three Fukushima reactors experienced full meltdowns, while the other three malfunctioned in various other ways. Due to the tsunami, flood waters swept in and out of the building, becoming irradiated and affecting the surrounding area. Japan has been criticized for its handling of the crisis, and international reception to nuclear energy has fallen sharply since the incident. In a Forum op-ed, <a href = "/forum/2011/04/fukushima-illustrates-need-for-policy.php">Fukushima Illustrates Need for Nuclear Policy</a> [JURIST op-ed], Tamar Cerafici of the Cerafici Law Firm discussed how the Fukushima disaster should guide US policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Carlos Antonio Carias, Manuel Pop, Reyes Collin and Daniel Martinez were <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/08/02/guatemala.human.rights.trial/">convicted of crimes against humanity</a> [CNN report] for being members of a military force that killed more than 250 people in the town of Dos Erres during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/guatemala.htm">36-year Guatemalan Civil War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], though the men were ultimately <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14383071">held accountable for only 201 deaths</a> [BBC report]. Three of the men were members of a special forces unit known as the Kaibiles, at least part of which is alleged to have played a role in the massacre. The military force was attempting to overthrow insurgents during Guatemala's military rule under General Efrain Rios Montt. The men <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/war-crimes-trial-over-guatemala-massacre-begins.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the war crimes charges at the start of the trial last week, arguing that they were not stationed with the group that carried out the atrocities at Dos Erres. Twenty-three witnesses, including former military officials and survivors, testified at trial. 

<p>The Guatemalan civil war resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala's large indigenous Mayan population. According to a UN <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/spanish/toc.html">report</a> [text, in Spanish; <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/1999/19990301.guate.brf.html">press release</a>] released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. Earlier in June, the UN said it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-applauds-arrest-of-guatemala-genocide-suspect.php">approved of the arrest</a> [JURIST report] of a former top Guatemalan military figure accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. General Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes, former chief of staff of Guatemalan armed forces from 1982-1983, is accused of directing military attacks against citizens, namely indigenous Mayans. Villages were destroyed and women and girls were systematically raped under his authorization. In response many deaths during the civil war, the Guatemalan government founded the National Compensation Program (PNR) in 2003 to deal with claims by civilians affected by the civil war. The PNR, after setting up its administrative structure, has begun to use its $40 million budget to work through a backlog of more than 98,000 civilian complaints. More than 1,000 complaints were filed in 2008. The PNR hopes to file the majority of the complaints within the next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] held that the <a href="http://sll.sdsu.edu/studentorgs/documents/HandbookJune30_000.pdf">SDSU nondiscrimination policy</a> [student organizations handbook, PDF] prohibiting all student organizations from discriminating on the basis of "race, sex, color, age, religion, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, physical or mental handicap, ancestry, or medical condition" is constitutional as written. The plaintiffs, <a href="http://www.alphadeltachi.org/">Alpha Delta Chi</a>, a Christian sorority, and <a href="http://www.ago.org/">Alpha Gamma Omega</a> [advocacy websites], a Christian fraternity, as well as several of their officers at SDSU, challenged the policy as violating their <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment rights</a> to <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise of Religion</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] and freedom of Expressive Association. They argued that the policy was unconstitutional because it allows secular groups to discriminate in membership based on certain viewpoints. They argued for example the that a campus immigration group is allowed to exclude those who do not agree with advancing immigration rights, while Christian organizations cannot exclude non-Christians. The Ninth Circuit distinguished this case from the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruling last year in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1371">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-upholds-all-comers-mandate-for-student-group-funding-at-public-school.php">report</a>] which found a policy that required student groups to be open to all students was constitutional. In this case, the Ninth Circuit still found the more limited SDSU policy that allowed discrimination when not based on one of the enumerated categories was constitutional because the policy "serves to remove access barriers imposed against groups that have historically been excluded." However, the court remanded the case in part because there was evidence that SDSU had approved membership for other organizations that have religion requirements either by accident or by exemption. 

<p>Alpha Delta Chi sorority required its members to accept "Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord," to have "active participation in Christian service" and "regular attendance or membership in an evangelical church." The Alpha Gamma Omega fraternity had similar requirements in addition to signing a "Statement of Faith" expressing devotion to the Christian church and its tenets. In <span class="casename">Christian Legal Society</span>, the Supreme Court ruled that the "all comers" policy at Hastings, which limits funding to student organizations that adopt the school's nondiscrimination policy, is reasonable and viewpoint neutral and does not violate the First Amendment. The Ninth Circuit later dismissed a claim by the <a href="http://www.clsnet.org/">Christian Legal Society</a> (CLS) [advocacy website] that the <a href="http://www.uchastings.edu/">University of California-Hastings School of Law</a> [academic website] selectively applies its nondiscrimination policy to CLS. In 2004, CLS became the first group to seek exemption from Hastings' nondiscrimination policy. CLS chapters exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in "unrepentant homosexual conduct" or holds religious convictions different from those in the "Statement of Faith", which all members are required to sign.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is the first time Apple has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-apple-korea-idUSTRE7721O720110803">punished for collecting location information</a> [Reuters report] from users of its widely popular mobile computing products. The <a href="http://www.ekcc.go.kr/index_new.jsp">Korea Communications Commission</a> (KCC) [official website] imposed the fine after it discovered that the iPhone collected users' location data and stored it for up to a year even when the users thought the location feature was turned off.

Only there one can order the removal of all biometric information previously gathered about him. An opt-out possibility, although available, is difficult for the average user to find. In light of this seems particularly concerning that it is the default even for underage users face recognition. But even if Facebook was offering a user-friendly method to opt-out, it would not meet national or European data protection requirements. For storage of biometrics a pre-issued, unambiguous consent by the affected is required.</blockquote>Facebook faces severe fines if they do not comply with the order to shutdown their auto-tagging system in Germany. An anonymous spokesperson said Facebook does <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-03/facebook-face-recognition-violates-law-gernab-federal-state-watchdog-says.html">not believe they are violating any privacy laws</a> [Bloomberg report].

<p>Facebook has frequently been under scrutiny for violating privacy laws in Germany. In July 2010, The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/germany-official-takes-legal-action-against-facebook-over-privacy.php">initiated legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against Facebook for accessing and saving non-users' personal information. <a href="http://www.hamburg.de/datenschutz/aktuelles/1429260/pressemeldung-2009-05-04.html">Dr. Johannes Caspar</a> [official profile, in German] stated the social networking site could be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jipwYBDk87V1KRECUQ_C2a_MsZrwD9GQDSV02">fined tens of thousands of euros</a> [AP report] for violating Germany's <a href="http://1.image.hamburg.de/contentblob/254750/data/datencheckheft.pdf">strict privacy laws</a> [materials, PDF, in German]. Facebook responded by changing the feature for German users. Earlier, he <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2010/06/15/google_faces_german_complaint/">filed a complaint</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report] against <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/">Google</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=google">news archive</a>], joining many in other  countries in contending that their Street View feature violates privacy rights. Facebook has also faced privacy complaints in other countries. A South Korean regulator said in December that Facebook was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/south-korea-says-facebook-not-complying-with-data-privacy-laws.php">not in compliance with the nation's data privacy laws</a> [JURIST report] and must more earnestly seek consent from users before accessing their personal information. The Canadian <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca">Office of the Privacy Commissioner</a> [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-privacy-commissioner-launches.php">launch a new probe</a> [JURIST report] of Facebook to investigate privacy issues in response to complaints. Before that, five Facebook users sued the company in a California court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/facebook-sued-in-california-court-for.php">alleging the site violated their privacy</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nonprofit <a href="http://www.njphysicians.com/">New Jersey Physicians, Inc.</a> [advocacy website], a doctor and his anonymous patient, argued that the new federal health care law goes beyond the enumerated powers allowed in the US <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution">Constitution</a> [text] by penalizing individuals who choose not to buy health insurance and preventing doctors from receiving payments directly from patients. However, a judge for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] ruled that all three lacked standing because of a lack of injury in fact. The Third Circuit agreed after <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/third-circuit-hears-arguments-in-health-care-law-challenge.php">hearing arguments in June</a> [JURIST report]:<blockquote>The only allegations pertaining to any injury in fact suffered by Patient Roe are as follows: (1) "Roe is a patient of Dr. Criscito who pays himself for his care," and (2) Roe "is a citizen of the State of New Jersey who chooses who and how to pay for the medical care he receives from Dr. Criscito and others." These allegations are factually barren with respect to standing. ... These allegations are insufficient to establish injury in fact. First, Roe fails to set forth any current "actual" "concrete and particularized" injury. ... Second, Roe's allegations do not establish that a future "concrete and particularized" injury is "imminent."</blockquote>The plaintiffs have yet to comment on the ruling or state if they will appeal.

<p>In June, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/11a0168p-06.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] the individual mandate provision of PPACA <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?682648548">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2011/06/30/obama_reaps_victory_as_judges_uphold_health_law/">plans to appeal</a> [AP report] to the Supreme Court. Also in June, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eleventh-circuit-hears-arguments-on-constitutionality-of-new-health-care-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of the individual mandate. The appeal was brought by the DOJ after the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] struck down the entire health care law after it determined that the individual mandate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">exceeds Congress' authority</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decided it can rule on two challenges to PPACA after the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/fourth-circuit-questions-authority-to-hear-health-care-law-challenge.php">requested briefs</a> [JURIST report] from all parties on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> (AIA) [text], which prevents injunctions against taxes before the tax is imposed, would bar review of PPACA until it is implemented. The Fourth Circuit already <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in May to resolve a split decision between the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against the individual mandate</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The mandate allows Iran to discuss and implement measures to meet its international human rights obligations, Shaheed said. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] adopted a <a href="http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/d_res_dec/A_HRC_16_L.25.pdf">resolution</a> [text, PDF] in March, appointing a Special Rapporteur to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-council-launches-iran-probe.php">investigate human rights violations in Iran</a> [JURIST report]. The resolution was drafted in response to concerns expressed by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] in an <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A.HRC.16.75_AUV.pdf">interim report</a> [text, PDF] alleging increases in executions, amputations, arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trials and possible ill-treatment of human rights opposition activists. Shaheed expressed optimism that Iran's government would comply with the mandate:<blockquote>It is my hope that the Iranian authorities will view my mandate as a secure and legitimate space in which to take steps to comply with its international human rights obligations, as well as an opportunity to address the areas of concern communicated to Iran during its interactions with the international community on human rights issues.</blockquote>Shaheed plans to submit his initial report at the sixty-sixth <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] in September.

<p>Iran has been heavily criticized for its alleged human rights abuses. Jailed Iranian journalist <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile] in July <a href="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/onlymehdi/O0QzEWBcteRm34lS1J986SdAkEfGni6OX9oU3we7Z7mOkO9UaRO3RcZJfaLK/Letter.doc">urged</a> [letter, DOC, in Persian] Shaheed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/imprisoned-iran-journalist-urges-un-probe-of-prison-conditions.php">investigate prison conditions in Iran</a> [JURIST report]. Saharkhiz alleged that the treatment of both political and general prisoners in Iran <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/jailed_iranian_journalist_appeals_to_un_rapporteur/24264623.html">amounts to crimes against humanity</a> [RFE/RL report], and compared the conduct of prison authorities to that of Joseph Stalin in Soviet-era concentration camps. In May, rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-groups-criticize-iran-detention-of-lawyers.php">decried</a> [JURIST report] Iran's persecution of lawyers. In January, the <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/">International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran</a> [official website] claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours. In January, prominent Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 11 years in prison. Sotoudeh was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/10/iran-jails-human-rights-lawyer">found guilty</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of moharebeh, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Also, in January, Iranian chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi delivered a speech at Tehran University indicating that he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/iran-chief-prosecutor-charges-pending-for-opposition-leaders.php">would prosecute opposition leaders</a> [JURIST report] for political unrest that took place after the country's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+elections">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement, delivered by <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/ctc/bio_puri.html">Ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri</a> [official profile] of India serving as August president, conveyed the UNSC's regret regarding the civilian deaths that resulted from mass protests and stated that those who were responsible for the violence should be held accountable. The UNSC asked Syrian authorities to refrain from using force, and allow relief workers to respond to the humanitarian needs of those affected by the unrest. The UNSC further asked Syria to cooperate with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] as it investigates the current humanitarian situation. The UNSC further called upon Syrian authorities to use the political process to resolve the tension between civilians and the government: <blockquote>[T]he only solution to the current crisis in Syria is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process, with the aim of effectively addressing the legitimate aspirations of and concerns of the population which will allow the full exercise of fundamental freedoms for its entire population, including that of expression and peaceful assembly.</blockquote> However, Lebanon, one of the councils non-permanent members, disassociated itself from the statement preventing a unanimous resolution, but it did not move to block adoption of the statement. The UNSC requested that UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] provide an update on the current situation in Syria within seven days. Ban called the statement a "clear message from the international community" and stated that his assessment will be "unbiased, impartial and true to the facts."

<p>This is not the first time that the UN has called upon Syria to address allegations of violence and human rights violations in connection with mass protests. In April, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] held an emergency special session and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">condemned the violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. The UNHRC called for a complete investigation of alleged human rights violations. Earlier in April, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">called for Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. In March, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The groups, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/index.asp">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites], <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_21711.pdf">sent a letter</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.detaineeinquiry.org.uk/">Detainee Inquiry</a> [official website] saying they would no longer participate after receiving information on the protocol and transparency of the inquiry. They argue that the inquiry conducted in the manner described to them would not comply with Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] on the prohibition of torture. The joint letter states:<blockquote>We are particularly disappointed that the issue of what material may be disclosed to the public will not be determined independently of Government and, further, that there will be no meaningful participation of the former and current detainees and other interested third parties. As you know, we were keen to assist the Inquiry in the vital work of establishing the truth about allegations that UK authorities were involved in the mistreatment of detainees held abroad. Our strong view, however, is that the process currently proposed does not have the credibility or transparency to achieve this. If the Inquiry proceeds on this basis, therefore, and in light of indications from the lawyers acting for former detainees that they will not be participating, we do not intend to submit any evidence or attend any further meetings with the Inquiry team.</blockquote>AI released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_21713.pdf">public statement</a> [text, PDF] on its decision to boycott the inquiry saying, "[c]rucially, [AI] believes that the Detainee Inquiry risks failing in its intended aim to systematically get to the truth of these allegations, and ensure that such abuses never happen again." The Detainee Inquiry released the protocol exactly one year after UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] said he would <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">set up an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the allegations of torture. The announcement came after 12 ex-detainees brought civil cases against the government, claiming that British agents took part in their mistreatment while they were held in prisons in foreign countries, including Pakistan and Morocco. 

<p>HRW <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/rights-group-urges-uk-to-set-up-judicial-inquiry-on-torture.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the new UK government, in May 2010, to set up the inquiry on torture allegations and reaffirm its support for human rights. The rights group claimed that allegations of complicity in the torture of terrorism suspects have badly damaged the nation's reputation and that steps need to be taken to restore the nation's reputation as "a nation that respects human rights." The group cited reports from the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt/jtrights.htm">Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmfaff.htm">House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee</a> [materials], which point out specific instances of torture and kidnapping in counterterrorism efforts. Among the many issues the HRW wanted the government to reconsider include the power of the government to detain terrorism suspects for 28 days without a trial and the government's ability to deport detainees to countries where they may be tortured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Smartphones now come with built-in global positioning systems (GPS), allowing users' movements to be tracked by law enforcement agencies, sometimes prior to having the phone in custody. But the extent that police are practicing this remains uncertain. Most jurisdictions have never encountered cell phone tracking as a legal question, so police are generally not required to obtain a warrant. The ACLU is demanding a review of information from each targeted department, including: if probable cause warrants are obtained to access cell phone location data, statistics on how frequently law enforcement gathers this data, how much money is being spent on cell phone tracking, and any other policies or procedures used to acquire cell phone location data. The ACLU also supports the <a href = "http://wyden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=b29a3450-f722-4571-96f0-83c8ededc332">Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act</a> [materials], introduced to Congress in June, which would require government agencies to obtain a probable cause warrant before seeking location data.

<p>As cell phones become more prevalent in society, they have become a tool for law enforcement officers to track or identify suspects. In January, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S166600.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that law enforcement officers can <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/california-high-court-rules-no-warrant-needed-to-search-cell-phone-text-messages.php">legally search text messages</a> [JURIST report] on a suspect's cell phone without a warrant incident to a lawful custodial arrest. The court held 5-2 that a search of the defendant's cell phone text messages in the police station 90 minutes after the arrest did not violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure without exigent circumstances. However, the California decision represents a split from the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/third-circuit-rules-warrant-may-be-required-to-collect-cell-phone-location-data.php">2010 ruling</a> and a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-supreme-court-rules-warrantless.php">2009 decision</a> [JURST reports] by the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] that both held that police must obtain a warrant before searching data stored on a cell phone. In June 2010, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1332.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">report</a>] unanimously in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1332">City of Ontario v. Quon</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that an employer's search of private text messages on a work-issued device does not violate the Fourth Amendment if the search is motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and is not excessive in scope.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tapie won a settlement with state-owned bank <a href="http://www.lcl.com/fr/">Credit Lyonnais</a> [official website, in French] in 2008 when Lagarde was acting as France's Finance Minister. A senior prosecutor contends that Lagarde "overstepped her authority" in <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2011/08/04/affaire-tapie-enquete-ouverte-sur-christine-lagarde_1556243_823448.html#ens_id=1553068">allowing the arbitration to proceed</a> [<em>Le Monde</em> report, in French] because the controversy involved a state-owned institution. Furthermore, an investigation would be needed to determine whether Lagarde sufficiently probed the neutrality of one of the arbitration judges. The investigation will be ongoing for several months, after which a decision will be made about whether to send the case to trial.

<p>Lagarde is not the only French official to be subjected to investigations. The Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/france-court-orders-chirac-corruption-trial-to-resume.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May that the corruption trial against former French president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12666433">Jacques Chirac</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chirac">news archive</a>] could continue. Chirac is being tried for allegedly misusing funds during his time as Paris mayor in 1990. The trial began despite the fact that the main plaintiff dropped out of the suit. Last September, the Paris city council <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-ex-president-chirac-settles-with-paris-in-corruption-case.php">accepted a settlement deal</a> [JURIST report] in which the former president agreed to pay USD $741,000 in compensation for the money paid out for false jobs. In exchange, the city agreed to drop out of the corruption suit. Chirac stated that the settlement was not an admission of guilt. A French judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-judge-orders-probe-of-chirac.php">placed Chirac under preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. Chirac's trial on corruption charges <a href="/hotline/2009/12/jacques-chiracs-trial-on-corruption.php">marks the first time</a> [JURIST comment] a former president will have to answer to charges against him in a court of law. The trial is a combination of two separate corruption-related cases, in which Chirac allegedly financed the Rally for the Republic (RPR), now renamed as the <a href="http://www.lemouvementpopulaire.fr/">Union for a Popular Movement</a> [party website, in French], by illegally establishing fake city positions between 1977 and 1995 for party members to collect salaries totaling several million dollars.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The man, whose identity remains concealed and who worked in Iraq as an intelligence officer, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g47CEnKf1uqeig6HJAvRSL_XQaIw?docId=28c59b8b05144562bd1fc45963f78e68">says</a> [AP report] the US military accused him of passing information to the enemy and abducted and tortured him without formally charging him with a crime under orders from Rumsfeld. Upon release and return to the US, the former intelligence officer filed a suit demanding compensation for property lost and rights violated. Rumsfeld sought to have the case dismissed on grounds of vagueness and separation of powers and for protection of sensitive intelligence. However, Judge James S. Gwin held: <blockquote>... [there is] no convincing reason that United States citizens in Iraq should or must lose previously-declared substantive due process protections during prolonged detention in a conflict zone abroad....In light of law declaring unconstitutional conduct or conditions of confinement that shock the conscience, as well as clearly established law recognizing constitutional protections against certain government action for United States citizens abroad, the Court finds that Doe has set forth facts that if true could show the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.</blockquote> This is the second time Rumsfeld, currently represented by the Justice Department, has been allowed to be sued personally in a torture case. The other suit, which Rumsfeld is now appealing, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-allows-rumsfeld-torture.php">allowed last year</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The last several years has seen a rise in the number of suits brought against Bush Administration officials. Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/07-5178/07-5178-1314239-2011-06-21.pdf?1308689287">upheld the dismissal</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-rumsfeld-torture-suit.php">report</a>] of a torture suit against Rumsfeld brought by four Afghan and five Iraqi citizens alleging they were illegally detained and tortured. Also earlier this year, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-98.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-ashcroft-immune-from-suit-over-witness-detention.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-98">Ashcroft v. al-Kidd</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder] that a witness in a terror investigation cannot challenge the constitutionality of an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a validly obtained warrant even if the government did not call or had no intention of calling the witness for trial. Several human rights groups have urged investigations into alleged detainee abuses authorized by the Bush administration.

As a result, state hunting quotas to control the wolf population will be allowed in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Utah. Judge Donald Malloy, citing a similar Ninth Circuit ruling as binding, declared the move lawful, if not distasteful:<blockquote>This case presents difficult questions for me. The way in which Congress acted in trying to achieve a debatable policy change by attaching a rider to the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 is a tearing away, an undermining, and a disrespect for the fundamental idea of the rule of law. The principle behind the rule of law is to provide a mechanism and process to guide and constrain the government's exercise of power. Political decisions derive their legitimacy from the proper function of the political process within the constraints of limited government, guided by a constitutional structure that acknowledges the importance of the doctrine of Separation of Powers. That legitimacy is enhanced by a meaningful, predictable, and transparent process.</blockquote>Plaintiffs in the suit, the <a href = "http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a> [advocacy website] were <a href = "http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2011/wolves-08-03-2011.html">disappointed</a> [press release] in the outcome: "Although wolf numbers have risen, the job of wolf recovery in the northern Rocky Mountains is far from complete." The <A href = "http://www.doi.gov/">Interior Department</a> [official website] also released a <a href = "http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Salazar-Ashe-Finalize-Agreement-with-Wyoming-on-Revised-Gray-Wolf-Management-Plan.cfm">statement</a> [text] on Wednesday stating that the wolf recovery plan was a success and hunting can begin anew.

<p>Controversy began over the Northern Rocky Mountains Wolf in 2009, when US <a href = "http://www.fws.gov/">Fish and Wildlife Services</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/wolf/74FR15123.pdf">removed</a> [federal registrar notice, PDF] them from the ESA, after a controversial Interior Department memo was published that several animals should be taken off the list despite their numbers not being at a sustainable level. However, Fish and Wildlife Services only gave control of the wolf population to state governments in Montana and Idaho, restricting the wolves in Wyoming under Federal guidelines. In August 2010, Judge Malloy ruled that it was improper to remove restrictions in one jurisdiction and not another, and put the wolves back on the ESA entirely. In response, the "wolf rider" was attached to the <a href = "http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h1/show">Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriation Act of 2011</a> [materials] bill, which became law in April. This reissued the previous rule, including the restrictions for hunting in Wyoming.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ruling is consistent with the recent US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-98.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-ashcroft-immune-from-suit-over-witness-detention.php">report</a>] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-98">Ashcroft v. al-Kidd</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder] that reversed the appeal court's denial of Ashcroft's motion to dismiss. Ashcroft had appealed the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/ninth-circuit-rules-no-ashcroft.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] of the Ninth Circuit appeals court that <a href="http://www.aele.org/law/Digests/jail18.html">absolute</a> and <a href="http://www.aele.org/law/Digests/jail21.html">qualified</a> [AELE backgrounders] immunity do not shield him from the suit. Al-Kidd, an American citizen who was detained pursuant to a material witness warrant later found to be factually inaccurate, had argued that qualified immunity did not apply because the detention violated his <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights. The Supreme Court ruled 8-0, with four concurrences, to reverse and remand the appeal court's decision, holding that Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law and was thus entitled to qualified immunity. The Supreme Court also ruled that a witness in a terror investigation cannot challenge the constitutionality of an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a validly obtained warrant even if the government did not call or had no intention of calling the witness for trial. 

<p>Various courts have issued opinions on claims filed by detainees against the government in relation to the post-9/11 detentions. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/5db86616-5920-47c7-b77c-2a7de561b3fa/1/doc/06-3745-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/5db86616-5920-47c7-b77c-2a7de561b3fa/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in December 2009 that post-arrest detention is legal in cases where the detainees are reasonably detained. In November 2009, five men who claim they were illegally detained after 9/11 reached a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/five-new-york-men-detained-and-abused-post-9/11-immigration-sweeps-settle-ca">settlement agreement</a> [CCR release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/us-government-settles-with-post-911.php">report</a>] with the US government for $1.26 million. In 2007, a district court judge granted the government's <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/files/Turkmen_Defs%27BriefOmnibusMotiontoDismiss.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> [text, PDF] a number of those claims against Bush administration officials and law enforcement organizations in <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/turkmen-v.-ashcroft">Turkmen v. Ashcroft</a> [CCR backgrounder], but refused to dismiss the abuse claims. Also in 2007, the government criminally <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/brooklyn-prison-guards-named-in-911.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] several guards at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/bro/index.jsp">Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn</a> [official website], the location in which men were detained, with abusing prisoners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hazleton's <a href="http://www.hazletoncity.org/090806/2006-18%20_Illegal%20Alien%20Immigration%20Relief%20Act.pdf">Illegal Immigration Relief Act</a> and <a href="http://www.hazletoncity.org/090806/2006-13%20_Landlord%20Tenant%20Ordinance.pdf">Landlord Tenant Ordinance</a> [texts, PDF] deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them. Last year, the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-rejects-pennsylvania-city-anti-illegal-immigration-laws.php">rejected the laws</a> [JURIST report] as unconstitutional, but May's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] on a similar Arizona law has caused a reconsideration of the laws. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/the-us-supreme-court-official.php">ordered the Third Circuit to reexamine the case</a> [JURIST report]. The city cannot immediately implement the laws, as they were originally <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-pennsylvania.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 by the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website].

<p>Illegal immigration has become the focus of much legislative and judicial activity recently. Earlier this week, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/U.S.%20Justice%20Department%20lawsuit.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] in the US <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] an Alabama <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">law</a> [HB 56 text] designed to restrict the actions of illegal immigrants. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. The DOJ contended that various provisions of the Alabama immigration legislation are preempted by federal law and violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the new proclamation, which took effect immediately, the Secretary of State determines which criminals or violators will be allowed into the US. Additionally, Obama commissioned the Atrocities Prevention Board, a panel assisting in deterring genocidal violence, which will begin work within six months. Obama explained the purposes and goals of the proclamation:<blockquote>By institutionalizing the coordination of atrocity prevention, we can ensure: (1) that our national security apparatus recognizes and is responsive to early indicators of potential atrocities; (2) that departments and agencies develop and implement comprehensive atrocity prevention and response strategies in a manner that allows "red flags" and dissent to be raised to decision makers; (3) that we increase the capacity and develop doctrine for our foreign service, armed services, development professionals, and other actors to engage in the full spectrum of smart prevention activities; and (4) that we are optimally positioned to work with our allies in order to ensure that the burdens of atrocity prevention and response are appropriately shared.</blockquote>The president also called for administration officials to present within 100 days a comprehensive, National Security Advisor-led interagency evaluation of the measures available for the prevention of mass atrocities. 

<p>Barring war criminals and rights violators may signal the Obama administration's commitment to international justice. In July, the administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-administration-issues-sanctions-to-fight-international-criminal-organizations.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/07/25/executive-order-blocking-property-transnational-criminal-organizations">executive order</a> [text] imposing economic sanctions to combat international <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=organized+crime+">organized crime</a> [JURIST news archive] operations, freezing their US assets, preventing the transfer of property to the organizations and criminalizing providing aid to the organizations. Earlier in July, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/us-brings-somali-terror-suspect-to-new-york-for-civil-trial.php">brought</a> [JURIST report] Somali terror suspect Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame to the US to face a civil trial in New York.

State Auditor Stacey Pickering is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/08/04/business-technology-hardware-amp-equipment-us-microsoft-attorneys-fees-mississippi_8600556.html">appealing</a> [AP report] a lower court ruling last April upholding $10 million in fees paid to private lawyers hired by the attorney general's office to handle a state lawsuit against Microsoft. The software giant settled with the state for $100 million and agreed to pay $10 million to the outside attorneys, as was directed by the trial judge at the time. The lower court decision against Pickering upheld the payments by ruling that the fees were separate from the state settlement, paid under a legal contract with the attorney general, and that in this case outside counsel actually received no state funds. Pickering argues that such monies are public and should be collected by the state, after which the attorney general can request appropriation from the <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/">State Legislature</a> [official website].

<p>The court heard a similar case in June over $14 million collected by a group of private attorneys who worked on a tax related claim against MCI/WorldCom. The original case ultimately resulted in the state collecting $100 million in cash and $7 million in downtown property from the telecommunications giant. Here also the attorney general maintains that the attorney's fees were separate from the state's settlement, negotiated and paid directly by MCI to the private law firm. Again Pickering argues that relevant state law should be interpreted such that outside counsel must be paid from funds appropriated to the attorney general and not directly out of litigation awards. In February a lower court granted <a href="http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/v3/images/documents/ORDER_GRANTING_SUMMARY_JUDGEMENT.pdf">summary judgment</a> [order, PDF] against Pickering, holding that his arguments had no merit and thus there was no genuine issue of material fact in the case. A decision on the appeal has yet to be issued by the state Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Khadr released his two Edmonton-based lawyers, Dennis Edney and Nathan Whitling, with Toronto-based attorneys John Norris and Brydie Bethell. The move comes just months before Khadr is supposed to be <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/08/04/2345505/captive-omar-khadr-fires-canadian.html#ixzz1U9oerYzT">expatriated to Canada</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] to serve the remainder of his eight-year sentence, a deal worked out by his former lawyers as part of an agreement to plead guilty. The directive, signed by Khadr, only said, "I wholeheartedly recognize the commitment you have shown in everything that you have done for me. I have the highest praise and respect for you both. Although I feel deeply indebted to you for your dedication, changing counsel at this time is in my best interests." Last October, Kkadr pleaded guilty to all five charges against him, including conspiracy, murder and aiding the enemy, under the conditions that he would serve an additional eight years in prison on top of the eight he has already served and that he be sent back to Canada. He is Guantanamo's youngest detainee and first juvenile to be convicted.

<p>Khadr was charged after he was captured following a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002 in which he threw a hand grenade that killed one US soldier and wounded another. In August 2010, the military judge rejected Khadr's claim that his confession was a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-judge-rejects-khadr-torture-claims.php">byproduct of torture</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that August, the same judge ruled that Khadr's confession was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/us-military-judge-rules-khadr-confessions-admissible-at-trial.php">admissible at trial</a> [JURIST report]. Canada had previously declined to seek Khadr's <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/canada-government-will-not-seek-khadr.php">repatriation</a> [JURIST report] after his former lawyers obtained a ruling in the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] that the interrogation of Khadr by Canadian officials while in detention violated <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/1.html#anchorbo-ga:l_I-gb:s_7">section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. According to the ruling, Canadian officials questioned Khadr, who was captured at age 15, even though they knew he was being indefinitely detained, and, in March 2004, he was questioned with knowledge that he was subjected to three weeks sleep deprivation by US authorities. Still, that ruling did not force the government to seek his repatriation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdnatesting.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A three-judge panel for the <a href = "http://www.courts.ca.gov/1dca.htm">California First District Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/A125542.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously on Thursday that DNA samples cannot be taken broadly from any adult arrested or charged with a felony. Striking down a <a href = "http://ag.ca.gov/bfs/prop69.php">2004 voter-enacted provision</a> [Propostition 69 materials] of the <a href = "http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/295.html">DNA and Forensic Identification Data Base and Data Bank Act of 1998</a> [text], the court ruled that such mandates violate the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] provisions against unreasonable search and seizure and overturned the lower court's ruling for the state. The law made it a misdemeanor for felons or suspected felons to refuse to provide a DNA sample for the state's "DNA bank." The state argued that DNA samples are akin to fingerprints and thus should be collected in the same manner. Justice Anthony Kline, writing for the unanimous court, disagreed:<blockquote>Even focusing on the DNA profile alone, the analogy to fingerprints is blind to the nature of DNA. Courts are well aware that&#8212;[r]ecent studies have begun to question the notion that junk DNA does not contain useful genetic programming material and that an intense debate on this subject is now taking place in scientific and legal communities. ... Like the DNA laws of almost every other state and federal law, the DNA Act is silent as to how long these specimens and samples may be kept, and it is reasonable to expect they will be preserved long into the future, when it may be possible to extract even more personal and private information than is now the case. ... [T]he Act places few restrictions on the law enforcement uses to which such information may be put. This raises questions both about the kind of personal and private information that may be derived from the DNA samples in the DOJ's possession, and the uses of that biometric data as scientific developments increase the type and amount of information that can be extracted from it. For example, commentators have discussed the potential for research to identify genetic causes of antisocial behavior that might be used to justify various crime control measures. Fingerprinting presents no comparable threat to privacy.</blockquote>The decision overturned plaintiff Mark Buza's misdemeanor conviction for not providing DNA evidence after confessing to committing arson. It is <a href = "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/08/05/MNLP1KJGRI.DTL&feed=rss.pageone">unknown</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] if state <a href = "http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] will appeal to the <a href = "http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website], but it is speculated that, if she does, Kline's decision will be overturned and the law reinstated.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/094718p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 8-6 that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/third-circuit-rules-police-can-collect-dna-sample-from-arrestees.php">law enforcement officers are permitted to obtain DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] from arrestees. The appeals court overruled a lower court's decision, concluding that because arrestees have a diminished expectation of privacy, the government's interest in collecting and testing the DNA sample outweighed the intrusion on defendant's privacy. The court pointed to the government's compelling interest in identifying suspects and the unique attributes of DNA evidence to reach its conclusion. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] instructed federal prosecutors in 2010 to use DNA evidence as much as possible and <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/holder-calls-for-increased-use-of-dna-evidence.php">collect DNA evidence from all federal arrestees</a> [JURIST report], in a reversal of Bush administration policy. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/mandatory.dna.testing.edca.opinion.052809.pdf">upheld the constitutionality</a> [opinion, PDF] of mandatory DNA collection for all persons arrested or detained under federal authority, holding that although the collection of DNA from those arrested on federal felony, sexual abuse, or violent crime charges does constitute a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, a person arrested based on probable cause "has a diminished expectation of privacy in his own identity." Federal agencies <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-expanding-dna-data-collection-to-all.php">began collecting DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009, although they had been authorized to do so since 2006. About 1.2 million additional people could be added to the FBI's <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/clickmap.htm">Combined DNA Indexing System</a> (CODIS) [official website; FBI <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/codis_brochure">backgrounder</a>] every year under the expansion, although people who are not convicted can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/16/AR2008041602729.html?hpid=topnews">request the destruction</a> [WP report] of their DNA samples. In November 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dna.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that all convicted federal felons must provide DNA samples to a federal database available to police departments throughout the country. In 2005, the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/appeals-court-upholds.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a convicted bank robber had to submit DNA samples to CODIS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Central and South American countries, including Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia, argue that the recently enacted law <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110803/NEWS/110803045/Mexico-16-other-nations-file-briefs-against-Alabama-immigration-law?odyssey=mod|breaking|text|Frontpage">unfairly treats citizens</a> [<em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> report] of those countries currently residing in Alabama. The law, they argue, sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity. The countries, who want one immigration law instead of 50, contend that the law raises "substantial challenges" to their relationship with the US. Also on Wednesday, Judge Sharon Blackburn of the Alabama district court consolidated lawsuits challenging the Alabama immigration law brought by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], the Methodist, Episcopalian and Roman Catholic churches and three dozen plaintiffs represented by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites].

<p>The Alabama immigration legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] in June, is one of the most rigid immigration reform laws passed recently. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. Earlier this week, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/U.S.%20Justice%20Department%20lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the Alabama district court. A group of immigrants <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/alabama-immigration-law-challenged-in-state-court.php">filed a lawsuit in an Alabama state court</a> [JURIST report] in late July arguing that the Alabama immigration law conflicts with the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/ACASLoginMac.asp">Alabama Constitution</a> [text], which expressly encourages immigration. The ACLU, the <a href="http://www.hispanicinterest.org/">Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama</a> (HICA) [advocacy websites] and several other civil rights groups jointly <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-seek-to-bar-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/motion_for_pi_-final.pdf">motion for preliminary injunction</a> [text, PDF] earlier in July in an effort to prevent the Alabama immigration law from taking effect. Similar laws have been passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports].

Just before the opening day of the APA's <a href="http://www.apa.org/convention/">annual convention</a> [official website], a 157-member policymaking body adopted the position that the federal government and state legislatures should repeal measures denying marriage rights to same-sex couples in an effort to move toward marriage equality. After reviewing and conducting research on same-sex couples married in states where gay marriage is legal, the professional organization found that marriage "does confer the same sense of security, support, and validation" to same-sex couples as it does to heterosexual couples. Furthermore, the group contends, state measures prohibiting same-sex marriage cause considerable stress for the lesbian, gay and bisexual population, stigmatize same-sex relationships and reinforce prejudice against homosexuals. The APA also urged professional groups to continue conducting research with the goal of better understanding the lesbian, gay and bisexual population, particularly with respect to relationships and family formation.

<p>Support for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22same-sex+marriage%22">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] is increasing in the US. New York began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples last week, just one month after New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">signed the same-sex marriage legislation</a> [JURIST report] into law. In July, a spokesperson for US President Barack Obama announced that the president <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-supports-doma-repeal.php">espouses repeal</a> [JURIST report] of the <a target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], and advocates the ratification of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced by Congressional Democrats</a> [JURIST report] in February to repeal DOMA, the 1996 federal law that defines marriage as a "a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife." In addition to New York, same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a>, as well as in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/american-indian-tribe-adopts-law-recognizing-same-sex-marriage.php">Suquamish and Coquille American Indian tribes</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Reversing a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-arrest-tymoshenko-upholds-travel-ban.php">decision he made last week</a> [JURIST report], Kireyev <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/xes5vc48">arrested Tymoshenko</a> [press release] on contempt charges. A blockade of supporters <a href = "http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/110197/">started a brawl</a> [Interfax-Ukraine report] outside the courtroom attempting to force officers to release Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko's former defense lawyer <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/ez97s3xc">released a statement</a> [press release] shortly after the arrest, which the former prime minister had prepared a week ago under the possibility of arrest:<blockquote>I want to make a statement regarding the plan to arrest me. Clearly this is an act of revenge against a political opponent, but that's not my point. I want to state that I have no intention of committing suicide. They don't need to repeat the tricks they did with Kirpa and Kravchenko. I will never end my life with suicide. Everything I do is my battle against this criminal regime for Ukraine' rightful place in the world. Glory to Ukraine.</blockquote>Prosecutors filed a <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/736mees7">petition for remand</a> after Tymoshenko <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/3enmw88a">questioned</a> [press releases] <a href = "http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/">Prime Minister Mykola Azarov</a> [official website, in Ukrainian].

The trial will <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/uxv2467a">resume on August 8</a> [press release]. Tymoshenko's legal team <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/9x95zzwn">will appeal</a> [press release, in Ukrainian] her arrest.

<p>There have been several minor developments in Tymoshenko's trial in the past week. Kireyev <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/8csvmm6e">again refused to recuse himself</a> and Tymoshenko announced that she was allowed to call only <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/soscx239">two of her proposed witnesses</a> [press releases]. Last month, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are  <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. Last month, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by Yanukovych, Tymoshenko's political rival. ECHR President Jean Paul Costa <a href="http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/1235011-v-espch-ne-kommentiruyut-perspektivu-iskov-timoshenko-k-ukraine">refused to comment on the complaint</a> [<em>Korrespondent</em> report, in Russian], but said the matter was before the court. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

OSCE Chairperson-in-Office, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis, said that the situation in Belarus is amounting to persecution of dissenters, citing the arrest of Aliaksandr Bialiatski, president of the <a href="http://spring96.org/en">Belarus Human Rights Centre</a> [advocacy website], and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/20/belarus-protest-alleged-vote-rigging">mass arrests of protestors</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] after <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">President Alexander Lukashenko</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Lukashenko">news archive</a>] won last December's election. Azubalis said: <blockquote>Trials of the participants in the December 19 demonstrations, systematic stifling of the media and freedom of assembly, and the continued persecution of opposition figures, non-governmental organizations and civil society, attest to the serious deterioration of the human rights situation in Belarus. ... I call on the authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners and civil society activists. Belarus must comply with its OSCE commitments on human rights and fundamental freedoms, which were reaffirmed at the highest level in December 2010, at the OSCE Summit in Astana.</blockquote>Earlier this week, Belarusian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/belarus-lawmakers-move-to-ban-silent-protests.php">moved to outlaw silent protests</a> [JURIST report] introducing a bill that would ban the mere assembling of people.

<p>The move to ban assembling seems targeted at silent protests across the country against Lukashenko. Taking part in unsanctioned protests is illegal in Belarus so protests are being organized largely through social media sites where the protestors meet at a previously agreed upon location and, for instance, clap hands. Lukashenko, who has been in power for 17 years since his 1994 election, cracked down on opposition presidential candidates and detained protestors during his bid for a third term in the last election. Earlier this year, Belarus' Minsk City Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-delivers-suspended-sentences-to-2-presidential-candidates-for-inciting-riots.php">delivered suspended sentences</a> [JURIST report] to two former presidential candidates, Uladzimer Nyaklyaeu and Vital Rymasheuski, convicted of organizing <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/us-and-eu-condemn-arrests-and-violence-after-belarus-elections.php">protests following the re-election</a> [JURIST reports] of Lukashenko. The <a href = "http://www.rferl.org/content/eu_belarus_sanctions_lukashenka_opposition_trials/24180855.html">two-year suspended sentences</a> [RFE/RL report] were handed down days after former presidential candidate <a href = "http://www.freebelarusnow.org/en/component/k2/item/43?ml=1">Andrey Sannikau</a> [Free Belarus Now profile] was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-presidential-candidate-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-inciting-riots.php">sentenced to five years</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <A href = "/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports]. While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US State Department has historically <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href = "/paperchase/2007/11/un-committee-concerned-about-belarus.php">UN General Assembly Third Committee</a> and the <a href = "/paperchase/2007/03/soviet-style-rights-abuses-widespread.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> [JURIST reports] have similarly denounced Belarus for human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gross was arrested in 2009 and has served 20 months of his sentence for his work as a <a href = "http://www.dai.com/">Development Alternatives Incorporated</a> (DAI) [corporate website] consultant, a business that contracts with the <a href = "http://www.usaid.gov/">US Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) [official website]. Gross claims that he was aiding the Cuban Jewish community to achieve unfiltered Internet access by distributing various communications devices, while the Cuban government alleges that he was creating internal networks to foment democracy on behalf of the US government. Gross, a 62-year-old Jewish social worker and international development professional from Maryland, was arrested in Havana as he attempted to leave Cuba. Gross maintains that he was operating <a href = "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/12/AR2010011203213.html">under good intentions</a> [WP report] and for the Jewish community at-large. No Cuban Jewish groups <a href = "http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/07/22/3088667/gross-tells-cuban-high-court-he-had-no-ill-intentions">testified at his trial</a> [JTA report] and disavowed knowledge of Gross, although it is a crime in Cuba to associate with those encouraging democracy. The US <a href = "http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] has demanded Gross' <a href = "http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/07/167949.htm">unequivocal release</a> [press briefing] and former US president Jimmy Carter <a href = "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jimmy-carter-cuba-trip-result-alan-gross-release/story?id=13247733">visited Cuba</a> [ABC News report] in an attempt to negotiate Gross' freedom.

<p>Until recently, the historically strained relations between the US and Cuba had shown signs of improvement. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-eases-cuba-travel-restrictions.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Departments of State, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury</a>, and <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Homeland Security</a> [official websites] to take steps to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/14/reaching-out-cuban-people">ease restrictions on travel and remittances</a> [press release] to Cuba. The new regulations, to be promulgated as modifications of the <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title31/31cfr515_main_02.tpl">Cuban Assets Control</a> [31 CFR &#167; 515.101 et seq.] and <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=8b684ec5c62f1adda0d3984257ecc67f&rgn=div6&view=text&node=19:1.0.1.1.21.15&idno=19">Customs and Border Protection</a> [19 CFR &#167; 122.151 et seq.] regulations, will allow greater travel from the US to Cuba for religious and educational purposes, the transfer of up to $2,000 per year to non-family members in Cuba so long as they are not senior government or Communist Party leaders, and will allow all US international airports to service charter flights between the two countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/donaldsonappeal08042011_2.pdf">notice of appeal</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/donaldson-and-guggenheim-v-montana">Donaldson and Guggenheim v. State of Montana</a> [ACLU backgrounder] with the court on behalf of six same-sex couples. The ACLU argues that Montana's failure to provide any legal recognition of same-sex couples violates the state constitution's protection of privacy, dignity, the pursuit of life's basic necessities and its guarantees of equal protection and due process. The ACLU says on its case page, "[t]he goal of this lawsuit is to see that same-sex couples are able to protect their families with the same kind of legal protections that the State offers to different-sex couples through marriage." Yet, the ACLU said it is not arguing for marriage equality in this lawsuit since Montana has a constitutional amendment banning it. A Montana judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] last April. The ACLU argued that the state has limited the couples' decision-making powers regarding their health care and finances and had sought for the state to <a href="http://www.aclumontana.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=156:aclu-sues-for-domestic-partnerships&catid=3:rightnews">provide a legal status to same-sex couples</a> [case materials] that would confer the same rights and obligations as marriage. Montana <a href="http://www.doj.mt.gov/department/attorneygeneralbiography.asp">Attorney General Steve Bullock</a> [official profile] in November <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/montana-ag-moves-to-dismiss-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">moved to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the lawsuit, arguing that the plaintiffs were not failing to receive protections because they were gay, but because they were not legally married, and that they received the same rights as all other non-married Montanans.

<p>There is growing support for full marriage equality for same-sex couples as <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a> [JURIST report] became the most recent state to legalize <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] in June, joining <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a>, as well as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/american-indian-tribe-adopts-law-recognizing-same-sex-marriage.php">Suquamish and Coquille American Indian tribes</a> [JURIST reports]. However, same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial and divisive issue through the US, despite a recent <a href="http://people-press.org/2011/03/03/fewer-are-angry-at-government-but-discontent-remains-high/">poll</a> [materials] suggesting support for legalization is growing. In May, Minnesota <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-senate-approves-referendum-on-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a referendum amending the state's constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Also, in April, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage or any "substantially similar" status, while the <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Senate</a> [official website] in February approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">void in Wyoming any same-sex marriages or civil unions</a> [JURIST report] performed in other jurisdictions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The document indicates that officers from the UK security and secret intelligence agencies, <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> and <a href="https://www.sis.gov.uk/">MI6</a> [official websites], respectively, were instructed to weigh the severity of the mistreatment of a detainee with the benefits of possibly obtaining information from the prisoner. The agencies "do not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment," the document said, though the agencies would "consider applying caveats or seeking prior assurances" if they foresee a risk of possibly mistreating or torturing a detainee. Agency officials were also directed not to publicly reveal the secret interrogation policies for fear that disclosure would lead to increased extremism:<blockquote>If the possibility exists that information will be or has been obtained through the mistreatment of detainees, the negative consequences may include any potential adverse effects on national security if the fact of the agency seeking or accepting information in those circumstances were to be publicly revealed. For instance, it is possible that in some circumstances such a revelation could result in further radicalisation, leading to an increase in the threat from terrorism.</blockquote>The interrogation policy was first issued to officers in Afghanistan in 2002 and was subsequently amended on two occasions. 

<p>The UK <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/docs/UKSC_2010_0107_Judgment.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] in July that secret service organizations <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/uk-supreme-court-bars-secret-evidence-in-guantanamo-trials.php">cannot withhold evidence</a> [JURIST report] from opposing parties nor conduct closed trials. The British government, on orders from UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website], is <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">engaged in an ongoing investigation</a> [JURIST report] into claims that government agents were complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects held overseas. The British government issued a new set of <a href="http://download.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/intelligence/consolidated-guidance-iosp.pdf">regulations</a> [text, PDF] regarding the use of information obtained via torture in July 2010 shortly after the human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-government-to-overhaul-interrogation-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a review of the country's torture policy. UK <a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> (EHRC) [official website] <a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/news/2010/september/commission-advises-government-that-torture-guidance-may-breach-the-law/">expressed concern</a> [press release], however, that the country's new regulations may still <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/uk-rights-commission-concerned-over-new-interrogation-guidelines.php">leave intelligence agents vulnerable</a> [JURIST report] to legal action for human rights crimes committed by others.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontisrael.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Supreme Court of Israel</a> [official website, in Hebrew] on Tuesday issued for the first time an order for the Israeli government to dismantle an illegal outpost in the West Bank. The order calls for Migron, the largest outpost in the West Bank, <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-s-supreme-court-orders-state-to-dismantle-largest-west-bank-outpost-1.376583">to be razed by the end of March 2012</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report]. The action came as the result of a <a href="http://peacenow.org.il/eng/content/migron-petition">petition</a> [materials] filed by <a href="http://peacenow.org.il/eng/">Peace Now</a> [advocacy website] in 2006 calling for the court to order Migron to be dismantled. In response the government had decided to remove the flagship settlement by August 2008, but <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/israeli-outpost-ordered-removed-20110803-1ibjj.html">later reached a compromise with settlers</a> [<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> report] that delayed the razing until the state could build them a new neighborhood in a nearby settlement. However, the delay only allowed more houses to be built, and the Court noted during deliberations that the intended two-year postponement had actually turned into an indefinite delay. Approximately 50 families, about 300 residents, currently live on the hilltop settlement, which is about five kilometers from Jerusalem. Few of the scores of settlements that have spread across the West Bank in recent decades have been built with official government approval, but many have goverment-funded access to roads and electricity and water hookups. Migron in particular is an unauthorized settlement setting atop privately owned Palestinian land.

<p>Israeli outposts in the West Bank are illegal under Israeli and international law. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-illegal-west.php">Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank "illegal"</a> [JURIST report]. The statement came two weeks after Israel announced the construction of 1,600 new housing units in <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/israel/jerusalem.htm">East Jerusalem</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], where Palestinians hope to establish the capital of their future state. Ban said, "the world has condemned Israel's settlement expansion plans in East Jerusalem. Let us be clear, all settlement activities [are] illegal anywhere in Occupied Territory... I urge all parties to respect sensitives and promote calm. We can and must find a way for Jerusalem to emerge from negotiations as the capital of two states with arrangements for holy sites acceptable to all."

California's prisoner realignment plan, which entails <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-prison-overcrowding-20110806,0,3137777.story">shifting thousands of low-level offenders to county jails</a> [LAT report], could reduce the prison population by 32,000 inmates&#8212;still a few thousand inmates short of decreasing the 180 percent prison capacity to the mandated 137.5 percent capacity, by June 27, 2013. The report states that despite statutory sentencing changes, out-of-state transfers, the construction of new prisons, and the realignment of certain adult offenders and parolees, California is urged to request additional time to comply with the order. The number of inmates currently in California prisons is approximately 143,500, about a 19,000 inmate reduction from 2006

A UN expert stated, "[w]e continue to receive reports on systematic use of excessive force resulting in killings and injuries; allegations of torture, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention of protesters; targeting of human rights defenders; and unjustified limitations on freedoms of peaceful assembly and expression." The <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] also recently condemned and <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-security-council-condemns-syria-rights-abuses-and-use-of-force-against-civilians.php">urged the Syrian government to address the requests of its people</a> [JURIST report] through a political process that guarantees fundamental freedoms. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on  <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] to cease all violence, to fully respect human rights and to implement the reforms the government had announced. Ban further urged Syria's compliance with international humanitarian agencies and warned that all killings will be investigated and people will be held responsible. Reports allege that at least 120 people have been <a href="http://news.oneindia.in/2011/08/04/unsc-condemns-syrian-govt-for-human-rights-violation.html">killed by security forces during civilian demonstrations</a> [PTI report], since Friday.  

<p>There has been a major struggle to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">put an end to Syrian violence</a> [JURIST report] since the protests began earlier this year. Most recently, the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38702&Cr=syria&Cr1=">UN expressed concern</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-urges-nonviolence-in-syria.php">report</a>] over violence in Syria and urged the Syrian government to stop using force against protesters. In June, Syrian and international human rights groups urged the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the hundreds of civilian deaths during protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The UNHRC, in an emergency special session in April, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4dbfe77d2.pdf">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST report] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters.

Also in April, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended </a>[JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued.

A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government </a>[JURIST report] in March to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence. As demonstrations continued throughout the country in March, the government<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/1119018/1/.html"> freed 260 political detainees</a> [AFP report] in an overture to the protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A spokesperson for the Shura Council <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE7751SL20110806?sp=true">confirmed</a> [Reuters report] that the draft of the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/sites/impact.amnesty.org/files/PUBLIC/Saudi%20anti-terror.pdf">Penal Law for Terrorism Crimes and Financing of Terrorism</a> [text, in Arabic] was discussed during a session of the council in which changes to make the law less severe were proposed. The amended version of the law would criminalize taking up arms against the king or crown prince as opposed to the original version, which made questioning the king or crown prince a crime, carrying a minimum prison sentence of 10 years. The council seeks to amend the draft further before sending it to the king for approval. However, the changes may be overridden, given the council's limited powers. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/saudi-arabia-anti-terrorism-law-would-thwart-political-dissent-ai.php">revealed</a> [JURIST report] the draft law and criticized it in a press release, contending that the legislation's definition of "terrorist crimes" is overly broad and would allow authorities to prosecute protestors for a wide range of conduct. AI also claimed that the draft law conflicts with international human rights treatises such as the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text]. 

<p>The proposed law comes in response to recent civil unrest in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern and North African nations, but this is not the first time Saudi Arabia has been criticized for rigid counterterrorism practices. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0809web.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] in 2009 that Saudi Arabia was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/08/04/saudi-arabia-counterterrorism-efforts-violate-rights">illegally detaining thousands</a> [press release] under the auspices of combating terrorism. The report echoed another AI <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/saudi-arabia-human-rights-abuses-name-fighting-terrorism-20090722">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/rights-group-accuses-saudi-arabia-of.php">report</a>] which claimed that Saudi Arabian officials were allegedly using anti-terrorism measures as an excuse to secretly detain, imprison, torture and even kill thousands of people. In February 2009, the US Department of State released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/nea/119126.htm">2008 Report on Human Rights Practices for Saudi Arabia</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">report</a>], in which it identified several significant human rights issues, including denial of public trials and lack of due process in the judicial system, detention of political prisoners, incommunicado detention and lack of government transparency. Saudi Interior Minister <a href="http://www.moi.gov.sa/">Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz</a> [official website, in Arabic] announced in October 2008 that the kingdom had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE49K2SI20081021">indicted 991</a> [Reuters report] suspected al Qaeda members. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/16/saudi-arabia-grant-visas-hrw-staff-defendants-trials">sought access</a> [HRW request] to the trials in an attempt to ensure compliance with international standards, but was denied.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proceedings, which are being held in open court, are expected to conclude following <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/08/07/3088872/supreme-court-hears-katsav-plea">two weeks of arguments</a> [JTA report]. Katsav's sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/israel-ex-president-prison-sentence-delayed-pending-appeal.php">postponed</a> in May, shortly after he filed the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/israel-ex-president-appeals-rape-conviction-to-high-court.php">300-page appeal</a> [JURIST reports]. Following a request from Katsav's defense team made at the time of the appeal's filing, the court ruled earlier that its contents will be conditionally released to the public in the future. The <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/heb/cv/fe_html_out/courts/details/310.htm">Tel Aviv District Court</a> [official website, in Hebrew] convicted Katsav in December, finding that he assaulted a female employee of the Department of Tourism during his time as minister and two women at the President's Residence during his time as president. Katsav's appeal puts forth that his relationship with the female employee was consensual and the trying judiciary was biased against him due to the media's pervasiveness during the trial.

<p>Katsav was initially <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-ex-president-indicted-on-rape.php">indicted on rape charges</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 for allegedly assaulting female employees in the 1990s. In 2008, Katsav <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-ex-president-rejects-plea.php">rejected a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] that would have permitted him to plead guilty to lesser charges of indecent assault, sexual harassment and obstruction of justice in exchange for a suspended sentence and the dropping of rape charges. The plea deal had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/israel-high-court-puts-katsav-plea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by women's and civil rights activists, prompting five separate petitions to overturn the agreement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The district court invalidated the act because it violated the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The appeals court rejected the defendants' contention that the state legislature has the power to prohibit certain medical treatments when other medical treatments are available and that the act is justified by a legitimate need to ensure security in state prisons. The appeals court first found that Gender Identity Disorder (GID) is a psychiatric disorder often treated with hormones to relieve psychological distress and that when hormones are withdrawn, severe complications may arise. The court found that the defendants failed to produce evidence to show that other treatment existed to effectively treat GID without hormones. By not providing the inmates with effective treatment, the court found that the DOC violated the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, articulated in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0429_0097_ZO.html">Estelle v. Gamble</a> [opinion text] by denying effective treatment for a serious medical need. To advance their second argument, the defendants argued that the more feminine male inmates become targets for sexual assault in prisons and therefore hormone therapy incites prison violence. The appeals court rejected this argument on evidence that showed transgender inmates may be targets for violence even without hormones and therefore the act had no legitimate purpose. The appeals court did not consider the Equal Protection challenge since it had concluded that the district court properly held the act violated the Eighth Amendment, both on its face and as it applied to the plaintiffs. 

<p>State lawmakers passed the hormone therapy ban when an inmate who had been receiving hormone therapy <a href="http://www.jsonline.mobi/126931148.htm">sued the DOC when it refused to pay</a> [<em>Journal Sentinel</em> report] for a sex-change operation. That inmate is not a part of this suit. The three plaintiffs in the suit are male to female transsexuals who have been diagnosed with GID. US District Judge Charles Clevert issued an injunction last year enjoining DOC officials from stopping the treatment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Winfield <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/08/05/2347081/whistle-blower-in-afghan-probe.html">pleaded guilty</a> [AP report] to involuntary manslaughter and to smoking hashish. Winfield, who has already spent a year in custody, was originally charged with premeditated murder and could have faced life in prison. He is one of five 5th Stryker Brigade soldiers accused in three civilian deaths during patrols in Afghanistan in January, February and May of last year. Winfield's charges stem from his failure to intervene and prevent the other soldiers from attacking Afghan civilians. Winfield notified his family about the killings who then informed the authorities. The Army took no action until they learned of the killings from a second source. Winfield will testify as a witness against the remaining defendants. 

<p>Winfield is the latest soldier to be sentenced in the probe into 12 members of the 5th Stryker Brigade regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">civilian deaths began in May 2010</a> [JURIST report]. In May, US army prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-army-charges-sixth-soldier-in-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">charged Staff Sgt. David Bram</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://info.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/">Joint Base Lewis-McChord</a> [official website] with solicitation to commit premeditated murder, failure to report crimes including murder, planting evidence near the body of an Afghan national, unlawfully engaging in murder scenario conversations with subordinates and aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon. Bram was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/second-us-charged-in-probe-into-afghan-civilian-deaths.php">court-martialed in November</a> [JURIST report] for charges unrelated to the murders. He was accused of severely beating an Army private in his unit to keep the soldier from informing superiors about alleged drug abuse within the unit. The charges included conspiracy to commit assault and battery, unlawfully striking another soldier, violating a lawful order, dereliction of duty, cruelty, maltreatment and endeavoring to impede an investigation. Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens, another member of the brigade, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty in December</a> [JURIST report] to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers following a plea agreement that will allow him to remain in the military after serving a nine month sentence and testifying against other soldiers accused of terrorizing civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Attorneys for Alabama state officials, including <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website], argue that the state law is not preempted by federal immigration law and that the text reflects a "spirit of cooperation with the federal government." The law contains mechanisms safeguarding against unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin, the attorneys contend, and allegations suggesting provisions of the law would deter students from enrolling in school are speculative. The three lawsuits challenging the Alabama immigration law, brought by the US <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">Department of Justice</a>, the Methodist, Episcopalian and Roman Catholic churches and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-seek-to-bar-alabama-immigration-law.php">three dozen plaintiffs</a> [JURIST reports] represented by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites], were consolidated last week. The law is currently slated to go into effect on September 1, though a hearing has been schedule for August 24 in the <a href="http://www.alnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Alabama</a> [official website].

<p>The Alabama immigration legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by Governor Bentley in June, is one of the most rigid immigration reform laws passed recently. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. Sixteen countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed briefs</a> [JURIST report] in the Alabama district court against the controversial Alabama immigration law last week, arguing that the recently enacted law <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110803/NEWS/110803045/Mexico-16-other-nations-file-briefs-against-Alabama-immigration-law?odyssey=mod%7Cbreaking%7Ctext%7CFrontpage">unfairly treats citizens</a> [<em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> report] of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity. A group of immigrants <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/alabama-immigration-law-challenged-in-state-court.php">filed a lawsuit in an Alabama state court</a> [JURIST report] in late July arguing that the Alabama immigration law conflicts with the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/ACASLoginMac.asp">Alabama Constitution</a> [text], which expressly encourages immigration. Similar laws have been passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports].

The coalition, including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.lwvsc.org/">League of Women Voters of South Carolina</a> [advocacy websites], argued in a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/comment_under_section_5_re_submission_no__2011-2495.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the DOJ that the new law would suppress the minority vote. According to the groups, there are more than 178,000 registered voters in South Carolina who <a href="http://www.lwvsc.org/files/vr_dl_table.pdf">lack a valid photo ID</a> [table, PDF], and African-Americans are disproportionately affected. The groups also argued that African Americans face social and economic barriers to obtaining valid photo ID and that the law is in violation of <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php">Section 5</a> of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> [DOJ backgrounders]:<blockquote>The voter ID provision of Act R54 is racially discriminatory and will have a retrogressive impact on the voting rights of minorities in South Carolina. Because there is ample evidence of its retrogressive impact, and given the dearth of evidence for its need, South Carolina has failed to meet its burden under Section 5. For these reasons, we strongly urge the Department to deny the State's request for preclearance or, in the alternative, request more information regarding the law's application and impact on minority voting rights.</blockquote>The Voting Rights Act of 1965, requires states such as South Carolina, with a history of voter suppression, to get approval for changes in their voting laws, so the DOJ has the power to block the law from taking effect. 

<p>There are now 30 US states that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 14 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In June, Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have required individuals to present government-issued photo ID at the voting booth. In May, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld a state law</a> [JURIST report] that requires voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement was made as thousands of <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=5221823&sponsor=">supporters called for her release</a> [Reuters report] outside the court in Kiev. Kireyev <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">ordered Tymoshenko's arrest</a> [JURIST report] last week on contempt charges. The US government on Saturday <a href="http://ukraine.usembassy.gov/government-statement-tymoshenko.html">expressed its discontent</a> [press release] with Tymoshenko's arrest, questioned the application of the rule of law in Ukraine and said the arrest appears to have been politically motivated.

<p>Kireyev <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/8csvmm6e">again refused to recuse himself</a> last week, and Tymoshenko announced that she was allowed to call only <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/soscx239">two of her proposed witnesses</a> [press releases]. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are  <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. Last month, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. ECHR President Jean Paul Costa <a target="_blank" href="http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/1235011-v-espch-ne-kommentiruyut-perspektivu-iskov-timoshenko-k-ukraine">refused to comment on the complaint</a> [<em>Korrespondent</em> report, in Russian], but said the matter was before the court. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych.

The report, which <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/newsroom/getarticle.asp?ArticleID=1546">analyzes the human rights situation in Iraq</a> [press release] throughout the year 2010, is based on information from UN and government agencies and civil society, as well as research gathered through direct monitoring. The report notes that "silent" rights abuses, like widespread poverty, economic stagnation, environmental degradation, and lack of opportunities and basic services, are some of the country's greatest developmental challenges. The study found that over 3,000 civilians were killed by insurgents and terrorist groups, with public officials, community and religious leaders, journalists, and medical and education professionals constituting the majority of targeted civilians. Law enforcement and the administration of justice remain problematic, detainees are regularly denied access to council, and torture and abuse at detention facilities and prisons remains despite some modest improvements. Women's rights continued to be a concern in Iraq throughout 2010 where domestic violence, trafficking, genital mutilation and honor crimes against women continue to be reported. Though large numbers of citizens voted in the general elections, violent acts were committed against civilians and politicians, particularly those from minority groups. Despite the reported abuses, regional governments continue to take "meaningful steps" to improve the human rights situation in Iraq, the report said. UNAMI and the OHCHR called on Iraq to implement the report's recommendations and respect the country's international obligations.

<p>Iraq has been closely scrutinized for human rights violations. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported in May that Iraqi authorities must <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/iraqi-authorities-must-halt-attacks-protesters-2011-04-11">end attacks on peaceful protesters</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/amnesty-international-ai-advocacy-website.php">report</a>]. AI also issued a report in September alleging that the Iraqi government is <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/thousands-iraqi-detainees-risk-torture-after-us-handover-2010-09-13">unlawfully detaining and torturing</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iraq-unlawfully-holding-torturing-thousands-of-detainees-report.php">report</a>] thousands of detainees. In June, UN Special Representative to Iraq Ad Melkert <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-advises-iraq-to-ratify-convention-against-torture.php">urged the Iraqi government</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text]. Melkert stated that Iraq had made several advances in recognizing human rights violations, but the government's policy implementation still faces several obstacles. The convention was adopted by the UN in 1984 and has been ratified by 147 countries. Iraq remains one of 45 member-countries that have yet to ratify the treaty. Last April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">reported on the repeated torture</a> [JURIST report] of Iraqi detainees in a secret prison in Baghdad. HRW reported that detainees held at the secret Muthanna facility, run by Iraqi authorities, were hung upside-down, deprived of air, kicked, whipped, beaten, given electric shocks and sodomized during torture sessions that detainees faced every three to four days. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Four top military officers resigned last week in protest of the detentions.

<p>The alleged coup plot highlights the continuing power struggle between Turkey's ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish] and the country's secular nationalist establishment, the <a href="http://www.tsk.tr/INDEX.html">Turkish Armed Forces</a> (TAF) [official website, in Turkish]. Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-police-detain-more-than-40-in.php">detained more than 40 people</a> in connection with the plot in February 2010 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">continued to bring charges</a> against alleged perpetrators, but <a href="/paperchase/2010_02_25_indexarch.php">released three high ranking military officials</a> [JURIST reports] just days later. The "Sledgehammer" plot is similar to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] conspiracy, in which the secular group is suspected of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">planning to overthrow</a> [JURIST report] the AKP. The Ergenekon group is also alleged to be involved in bombings, political assassination plots and the death of journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary]. The probe into the Ergenekon conspiracy has been criticized as an attempt by the AKP to silence opposition and further its <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1001934.html">imposition of Islamic principles</a> [DPA report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">report</a>] in violation of Turkey's secular <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/tu00000_.htmll">constitution</a> [text]. <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">Trials against the Ergenekon group</a> [JURIST report] opened over two years ago with more than 200 suspects in custody.

The Bangladesh <a href="http://www.lcgbangladesh.org/corruption/docs/ACC_Act_Annotated.pdf">Anti-Corruption Commission</a> (ACC) [governing statute] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gm90FcduxIEm-9d78Pu9JS2DGFyA?docId=CNG.b297b50cc6bfa351b47c8255989665aa.c11">brought the charges</a> [AFP report] in connection with USD $1.05 million in donations to a charity named after her late husband Zia Rahman. The charges allege that Zia used her position as prime minister to force people to make donations to the charity. Zia and her son have faced multiple sets of corruption charges under the current government led by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7803549.stm">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina</a> [BBC profile]. In July 2010, the ACC charged ZIa and her son with corruption for <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bangladesh-ex-pms-son-charged-with-corruption.php">allegedly laundering three million dollars</a> [JURIST report] through bank accounts in Singapore. Also in 2009, Zia, her son and the <a href="http://www.albd.org/autoalbd/index.php">Bangladesh Awami League</a> [party website] faced a trial on accusations of embezzling over $305,000 in the Zia Orphanage Trust, which is said to be nonexistent. 

<p>The multiple sets of charges against Zia and her son are part of a political joust between the opposition leader and Hasina. In May 2010, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/bangladesh-court-drops-last-of-corruption-charges-against-pm.php">court dropped corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] against Hasina holding that she had not committed a criminal offense when she used government funds to to appoint US lobbyists to represent the <a href="http://www.epzbangladesh.org.bd/">Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority</a> [official website] during her 1996-2001 administration. All the cases were brought against Hasina between 2001 and 2008 when she was out of power. Since being sworn into office after her <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/hasina-elected-bangladesh-pm-in-heavily.php">reelection</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 each charge has either been redacted by the accuser or quashed by the court. Supporters of Hasina claim that the charges filed against her were politically motivated by Zia, the leader of the military-backed regime displaced by Hasina. In April 2009, Bangladeshi judges explicitly dismissed two cases against Hasina on grounds that they were <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/bangladesh-prosecutors-to-drop-two.php">filed to harass her</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two American citizens brought a cause of action recognized in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion text] against Rumsfeld, claiming that he was personally responsible for the alleged unconstitutional treatment they faced while in detention in Iraq. Last year, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-allows-rumsfeld-torture.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Rumsfeld's motion by to dismiss the suit. Rumsfeld appealed the decision, but the appeals court sided with the district court's ruling:
<blockquote>[T]his case is not about constitutional rights, against torture or otherwise&#8212;the defendants readily acknowledge that the type of abuse alleged by the plaintiffs would raise serious constitutional issues. Rather, this case centers on the appropriate remedies for that abuse and who must decide what those remedies will be. ... [B]oth circuits confronted with allegations of constitutional violations in war zones have refused to recognize a Bivens remedy. ... The court vaults over this consensus and, for the first time ever, recognizes a Bivens cause of action for suits alleging constitutional violations by military personnel in an active war zone.</blockquote>Sleep deprivation and physical abuse are among the tactics allegedly used by the military. On Rumsfeld's role in the case, the court added that, "plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Secretary Rumsfeld acted deliberately in authorizing interrogation techniques that amount to torture. (Whether he actually did so remains to be seen.)"

<p>The appeals court ruling comes days after a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-allows-US-intelligence-officers-suit-against-rumsfeld.php">Rumsfeld can be sued</a> [JURIST report] by a former US military contractor who claims he was tortured while imprisoned in Iraq. The last several years have seen a rise in the number of suits brought against Bush administration officials. Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-rumsfeld-torture-suit.php">upheld the dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a torture suit against Rumsfeld brought by four Afghan and five Iraqi citizens alleging they were illegally detained and tortured. Also this year, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-98.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-98">Ashcroft v. al-Kidd</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that former US attorney general <a href="/currentawareness/ashcroft.php">John Ashcroft</a> [JURIST news archive] is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-ashcroft-immune-from-suit-over-witness-detention.php">immune from suit</a> [JURIST report] by a witness detained in a terror investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontantiabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] on Monday filed an <a href="http://c0391070.cdn2.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/pdf/aclj-s-amicus-brief-supporting-indiana-law-defunding-planned-parenthood.pdf"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [text, PDF] seeking to uphold an Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2011/HE/HE1210.1.html">state law</a> [HEA 1210 text] that would block Medicaid funding for <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana</a> (PPIN) [advocacy website] and other organizations providing abortion services. The brief, filed in the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website], urges the court to reverse a lower court ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-issues-injunction-against-indiana-abortion-law.php">granted a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the bill, which was signed into law in May. The ACLJ contends that the law is not preempted by federal Medicaid law:<blockquote>Federal Medicaid statutes and regulations give States broad discretion to craft the rules applicable to their Medicaid programs. Congress left intact the States' authority to determine what makes an entity qualified to provide Medicaid services, while ensuring that Medicaid recipients may utilize any practitioner deemed to be qualified under State law. Since HEA 1210 does not limit a beneficiary's ability to choose among providers that are deemed to be qualified, it is consistent with federal Medicaid law.</blockquote>The advocacy group also maintains that the law does not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions and does not violate doctors' rights. The brief was filed on behalf of 41 members of Congress and over 25,000 Americans.

<p>In May, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-indiana-planned-parenthood-cuts.php">refused to block the law</a> [JURIST report] upon passage. But the June ruling from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] granting the injunction is in line with a recent US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] brief that <a href="http://www.mainjustice.com/files/2011/06/Planned-Parenthood-DOJ-Filing.pdf">urged the court to grant an injunction</a> [brief, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-indiana-ban-on-medicaid-funds-to-abortion-providers-violates-federal-law.php">stop the enforcement of the Indiana law</a> [JURIST report]. The brief echoed arguments made earlier this month by the Obama administration, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">argued against the law</a> [JURIST report] in a letter to the state&#8212;one of several to have acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. In May, Planned Parenthood and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota law requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that would have restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">first get a sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the report, workers are subject to mauling by dogs, multiple beatings and rape. The camps, one of which allegedly has ties to a personal friend of Zimbabwean <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/643737.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>], are reported to have been operating for three years. The news comes just as the EU announced intentions to lift a ban on diamonds from other areas in Zimbabwe that were mined in compliance with the international diamond market regulator <a href="http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/">Kimberley Process</a> (KP) [official website, French]. UK Minister for Africa <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/our-ministers/henry-bellingham">Henry Bellingham</a> [official profile] <a href="http://ukeu.fco.gov.uk/en/news/?view=News&id=640699582">addressed allegations of torture</a> [press release] in some of the camps:<blockquote>The UK is absolutely committed to eradicating the trade of conflict diamonds. We played a leading role in creating the [KP], which has helped reduce the proportion of conflict diamonds to a tiny fraction of world trade. We pressed for Zimbabwe to adhere to the principles of the KP. Two Marange mines currently meet these standards; it is only from these locations that we support exports, subject to ongoing monitoring. From all other Marange mines, the UK and the EU continue to strongly oppose the resumption of exports until independent, international experts deem them to comply with the KP.</blockquote>Earlier in the year, the KP had called for police monitoring of the camps, but torture victims claim that the police, as well as military officials, are responsible for the treatment in the camps.

<p>The diamond trade in Zimbabwe has been the subject of much criticism. Last year, the US-based <a href="http://www.rapnet.com/">Rapaport Diamond Trading Network</a> [corporate website] took a stance <a href="http://www.rapnet.com/News/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=32094">against the sale of Zimbabwe diamonds</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/diamond-trading-group-bans-sale-of-zimbabwe-stones-over-rights-violations.php">report</a>] associated with human rights violations. In a letter to their members, Rapaport stated they would expel members who knowingly traded the tainted diamonds and that they would publish the names of members who traded the stones. Rapaport noted that KP certification may have allowed the stones to be sold in certain jurisdictions, but warned that it was illegal for citizens from the US, EU and UK to knowingly trade diamonds from the Marange diamond fields. They also cautioned that KP certification did not guarantee that the diamonds were not associated with human rights violations and that KP did not have a mandate to deny certification for diamonds involved in human rights violations. In June 2010, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/90988">called for the removal of Zimbabwe</a> [report materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/diamond-monitoring-body-urged-to-suspend-zimbabwe-over-rights-abuse-allegations.php">report</a>] from KP, echoing similar sentiments from rights groups who urged KP to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/diamond-monitoring-body-urged-to-ban.php">suspend Zimbabwe's international diamond trade</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009 due to the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/6486414/Kimberley-Process-considers-ban-on-Zimbabwe-diamond-exports.html">human rights violations</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] allegedly committed by the Zimbabwean army against civilians and illegal workers in the Marange diamond fields.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two Canadian citizens filed suit against the <a href="http://www.fec.gov/">Federal Elections Commission</a> (FEC) [official website], arguing that they should be permitted to contribute to US political candidates and committees. Though the plaintiffs have visas to legally live and work in the US, the panel <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/appeals-court-upholds-campaign-finance-ban-on-foreign-donations/2011/08/08/gIQAbaNO3I_story.html">unanimously ruled</a> [WP report]  that foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to participate in democratic elections in the US.

Alleging that HTC violated <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/us/title19/19usc1337.html">section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930</a> [text] by importing copyrighted products, Apple is seeking an exclusion order as well as a cease and desist order. The USITC will establish a completion date for the investigation in 45 days.

<p>This latest investigation is the most recent installment in Apple's patent dispute with HTC. Last month, the USITC <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">ruled against HTC</a> [JURIST report] for patent infringement on patents <A href = "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5,946,647.PN.&OS=PN/5,946,647&RS=PN/5,946,647">5,946,647</a> and <A href = "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,343,263.PN.&OS=PN/6,343,263&RS=PN/6,343,263">6,343,263</a> [texts], both of which relate to cell phones that run the Android operating system. That was the second suit against HTC by Apple. Last year, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/apple-files-patent-infringement-suit.php">filed suits</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> and with the USITC alleging patent infringements. HTC later also <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/htc-files-patent-infringement-complaint-against-apple.php">filed a suit</a> [JURIST report] against Apple for infringement related to portable electronic devices. In addition, the USITC announcement comes days after South Korean regulators <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-korea-regulator-fines-apple-for-collection-of-iphone-user-location-information.php">fined</a> [JURIST report] Apple USD $2,855 for collecting location information from its iPhone and iPad users. It is the first time Apple has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-apple-korea-idUSTRE7721O720110803">punished for collecting location information</a> [Reuters report] from users of its widely popular mobile computing products.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Besigye was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/jurist-1.php">arrested earlier this year</a>  [JURIST report] in connection with protests against rising food and fuel costs. The protests were known as the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Ugandas-Walk-To-Work-Protests-Will-Continue-says-Activist-120003879.html">"Walk to Work" protests</a> [VOA report] because participants refrained from taking motor vehicles to show their discontent over high fuel prices. The demonstrations turned violent and led to large numbers of arrests and injuries as well as <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2067136,00.html">several deaths</a> [TIME report]. While being arrested, Besigye himself was shot in the hand and abused by police. On his release, Besigye said that the government should "become serious" and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/uganda-court-acquits-opposition-leader-of-inciting-violence-after-protest-marches/2011/08/09/gIQAOooM4I_story.html">avoid unjustly prosecuting political opponents</a> [AP report].

Pillay also <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE74000420110501?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">criticized</a> [Reuters report] the government's treatment of Bezigye during one of his arrests, where a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13246913">video showed government forces breaking into his SUV</a> [BBC report], shooting pepper spray directly into his face and forcing him into the back of a pickup truck. Besigye is the leader of Uganda's most prominent opposition party, the <a href="http://www.fdcuganda.org/index.html">Forum for Democratic Change</a> [part website]. He lost to incumbent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1196167.stm">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [BBC profile] in elections held this past February. The elections were <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/20/ugandan-leader-wins-presidential-election">criticized by the opposition as fraudulent</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Besigye also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11524243">ran for president</a> [BBC report] in 2002 and 2006, and, prior to that, he was Museveni's personal doctor.

The <a href="http://www.wildrockiesalliance.org/index.html">Alliance for the Wild Rockies</a> (AWR), <a href="http://www.friendsoftheclearwater.org/">Friends of the Clearwater</a> and <a href="http://www.wildearthguardians.org/site/PageServer">WildEarth Guardians</a> [advocacy websites] are seeking to reverse the judgment handed down by Judge Donald Molloy of the <a href = "http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Montana</a> [official website], who last week <a href = "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/missoulian.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/e5/4e5a103c-be2e-11e0-80fc-001cc4c03286/4e39e3b35598e.pdf.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that Congress did not violate the Constitution when it effectively overturned his previous ruling striking down a 2009 delisting rule issued by the <a href = "http://www.fws.gov/">US Fish and Wildlife Service</a> [official website]. The rule <a href = "http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/wolf/74FR15123.pdf">removed</a> [federal registrar notice, PDF] the <A href = "http://www.yellowstoneinsider.com/issues/wolves/wolves-in-yellowstone-a-short-history/all-pages.php">Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf</a> [Yellowstone Insider backgrounder] from <a href = "http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/esa.html">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) [materials] protection list in all areas outside of Wyoming. AWR Executive Director Michael Garritiy said that <a href="http://www.wildrockiesalliance.org/news/2011/0808wolfPR.shtml">Congress acted unlawfully</a> [AWR press release]:<blockquote>While Congress absolutely has the right to make and amend laws, the wolf delisting rider (Section 1713 of the budget law, PL 112-10) does not amend the Endangered Species Act&#8212;it circumvents the judicial process by ordering the reinstatement of the 2009 rule that delisted wolves. Moreover, by exempting it from judicial review it basically nullifies the Constitutional checks and balances between Congress and the Judicial Branch of government.</blockquote>Garrity pledged to pursue the matter to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

<p>The wolves were removed from the shelter of the ESA after a controversial Interior Department memo was published that several animals should be taken off the list despite their numbers not being at a sustainable level. The delisting order leaves the wolves under the purview of the Montana and Idaho state governments. Montana began selling <a href="http://fwpiis.mt.gov/content/getItem.aspx?id=51629">wolf hunting licenses</a> [state hunting regulations, PDF] on the same day as Molloy's ruling. There is no limit on the number of licenses sold, but the hunting season will be closed in hunting districts around the state as regional quotas are reached. Montana hunters will be able to shoot as many as 220 gray wolves in Montana in a hunt scheduled to begin in early September, first with an archery season and then later with a rifle season. The state expects that the hunt will reduce the predator's Montana population by about 25 percent to a minimum 425 wolves. Environmentalists say they believe the population will be reduced further than that.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Journalists Protection Law, <a href = "/paperchase/2009/08/iraq-officials-announce-draft-bill-to.php">originally proposed in August of 2009</a> [JURIST report] protects journalists from questioning or investigations unless a judge mandates that action. The original bill only protected Iraqi journalists, but the passed law has <a href = "http://en.aswataliraq.info/Default1.aspx?page=article_page&id=143277&l=1">provisions for foreign media</a> [Aswat al-Iraq report] if they contract with the Iraqi Union of Journalists. Although the law has been long-sought after, several rights organizations have criticized it. <a href = "http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters without Borders</a> (RWB) [advocacy website] in March sent a <a href = http://en.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/110510_plpj_gb.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the Iraqi parliament with recommendations for the bill, including criticizing its overall vagueness, which could result in possible arbitrary enforcement. The group was also troubled by membership in the Iraqi Union of Journalists being a requirement for protection, "given that many journalists in Iraq dispute this union's legitimacy." It also denounced the lack of protections for bloggers and media contributors. The <a href = "http://www.jfoiraq.org">Journalistic Freedoms Observatory</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic], an Iraqi journalism rights group, commented simply that the government will be <a href = "http://en.aswataliraq.info/Default1.aspx?page=article_page&id=144207&l=1">responsible</a> [Aswat al-Iraq report] if abuses continue. A Movement for Change party member and parliamentarian, Sardar Abdullah, said the law <a href = "http://en.aswataliraq.info/Default.aspx?page=article_page&c=slideshow&id=144209">does not represent the people or journalists</a> [Aswat al-Iraq report] and that it was passed with a bare majority while many legislators were absent.

<p>RWB ranked Iraq 130 in their <a href = "http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html">2010 Press Freedom Index</a> [text]. In September, RWB released a report <a href="http://en.rsf.org/iraq-the-iraq-war-the-heaviest-death-07-09-2010,38294.html">detailing the 230 murders of journalists</a> [materials] that have occurred since 2003. Their profile of Iraq lists several <a href="http://en.rsf.org/iraq.html">journalists who have faced lawsuits and have been victimized by violence</a> [materials]. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/">UN Assistance Mission for Iraq</a> (UNAMI) and the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] both reported that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/iraq-human-rights-abuses-continue-un-report.php">human rights abuses continue to plague various regions of Iraq</a> [JURIST report]. The study found that over 3,000 civilians were killed by insurgents and terrorist groups, with public officials, community and religious leaders, journalists, and medical and education professionals constituting the majority of targeted civilians. In October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that journalists in Iraqi Kurdistan who criticize the government are <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/iraq-kurdistan-journalists-facing-violence-lawsuits-hrw.php">facing increased intimidation, violence and lawsuits</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

On August 1, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-law-defunding-of-planned-parenthood.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] preventing the health centers from losing funding. Judge Thomas Marten ruled the statute barring funding for Planned Parenthood was in direct conflict with federal law and that PPKM demonstrated the requisite elements for injunctive relief, as well as likelihood of success on the merits of its claim. The appeal <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/index.ssf/story/kansas-appeals-ruling-in-planned-parenthood-case/0017693077e049efb20f89fa9ca0e38e">seeks to suspend the injunction</a> [AP report] until the court rules on the merits of PPKM's case.

<p>Several states have made similar efforts to cut funding for abortion services. This week, the <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-urged-to-uphold-indiana-abortion-funding-restrictions.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://c0391070.cdn2.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/pdf/aclj-s-amicus-brief-supporting-indiana-law-defunding-planned-parenthood.pdf"><em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [text, PDF] seeking to uphold an Indiana <a target="_blank" href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2011/HE/HE1210.1.html">state law</a> [HEA 1210 text] that would block Medicaid funding for <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana</a> (PPIN) [advocacy website] and other organizations providing abortion services. In July, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/centralnc/">Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina</a> (PPCNC) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/local-press-releases/planned-parenthood-seeks-injunction-against-family-planning-defunding-north-carolina-budget-37190.htm">filed a lawsuit</a> [press release] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/planned-parenthood-seeks-to-block-north-carolina-from-defunding-it.php">block the enforcement</a> [JURIST report] of North Carolina's budget that denies state and federal funds used to subsidize Planned Parenthood family planning services and teen sex education. Kansas currently has multiple suits challenging new abortion restrictions. In July, another judge for the US District Court for the District of Kansas <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-abortion-law-requiring-licenses-for-clinics.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] in a lawsuit filed by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website], to block another Kansas regulation requiring clinics within the state to obtain a license to perform abortions. Without the injunction, two of Kansas' three abortion clinics would have been forced to close for failure to meet the new requirements for a license. Kansas is also among multiple states that have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arrest <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-files-4-indictments-in-hariri-assasination-investigation.php">warrants were issued</a> [JURIST report] in June for Mustafa Badreddine, Salim al-Ayyash, Hasan Aineysseh and Asad Sabra, who are <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2011/Jun-30/STL-delegation-meets-with-state-prosecutor.ashx#axzz1Qm6bjcSK">alleged members</a> [<em>Lebanon Daily Star</em> report] of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder]. In his report, the Lebanese Prosecutor General told the tribunal that authorities have not yet detained any of the suspects. Judge Antonio Cassese, president of the STL, is expected to review the report and determine how to proceed with the warrants. Lebanon is obligated under the UN Security Council <a href="http://www.unicbeirut.org/unic_editor/Download.asp?table_name=uploadDocs&amp;field_name=id&amp;FileID=244">Resolution 1757</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/un-security-council-narrowly-approves.php">report</a>] to arrest, detain and transfer the suspects to STL custody. 

<p>In February, the appeals chamber of the STL issued a unanimous <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/News/Summary%20of%20Decision_16%20February%20%28EN%29.pdf">ruling</a> [summary, PDF; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/sid/250">press release</a>] on several procedural issues, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-defines-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">including the definition of terrorism</a> [JURIST report], in judicial proceedings. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine which laws to apply in the case against persons accused of involvement in the February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. Using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Article 314 of the Lebanese Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF], the court held that a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger," that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case. Last August, Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">submitted evidence to the STL</a> [JURIST report] linking Israel with the bombing. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">asked for the evidence</a> [JURIST report] a week earlier after Hezbollah Secretary General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile] claimed to have proof that Israel was behind the bombing. The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his decree, Karzai acknowledged that the <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/eng/">Independent Election Commission</a> (IEC) [official website] has ultimate authority on determining election results in the country. <a href="http://ukinafghanistan.fco.gov.uk/en/">UK Ambassador to Afghanistan Sir William Patey</a> [official website] <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/HMAKabul/statuses/101299461262819328">welcomed the decision</a> [tweet]. The IEC plans to <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/08/10/3068082/afghan-president-courts-cannot.html">review the documents</a> [AP report] and materials obtained by the special court in order to make a final judgement on whether any lawmakers should be removed.

<p>With the US withdrawing troops, ongoing disputes over irregularities in last September's parliamentary elections have raised doubts about the stability of the Afghan government. In January, Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-president-orders-delay-in-seating-of-new-parliament.php">postponed the seating</a> [JURIST report] of Parliament following a request by the special court for more time to look into allegations of fraud surrounding the elections. Karzai had <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-high-court-to-investigate-election-complaints-possibly-changing-results.php">promised</a> [JURIST report] to have the special court review the election results in time to seat the election by the original January deadline. But the IEC claims that the special does not have legal authority to question the results that it certifies because the law says it has the final say in determining the elections results. In November, the Afghanistan <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/afghanistan-officials-disqualify-21-parliamentary-candidates-for-fraud.php">disqualified 21 candidates</a> [JURST report] for electoral fraud after finding widespread voting irregularities in 12 provinces. Of the disqualified candidates, 19 had either won or were leading in their districts, seven of which were incumbents, and two were second place finishers in districts where the first place finisher was also disqualified. In October, the IEC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">invalidated 1.3 million votes</a> [JURIST report], nearly a quarter of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide, due to findings of fraud. The IEC found that the 2,543 polling stations where the votes had been cast did not follow IEC procedures. </p>]]></content:encoded>

However, the law will only go into effect if enough states to constitute an electoral college majority enact similar laws. Eight other jurisdictions have already done so: <a href = "/paperchase/2007/03/maryland-senate-votes-to-bypass.php">Maryland</a> [JURIST report], New Jersey, Illinois, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, Washington DC and Vermont. The movement thus has 132 of the 270 electoral votes needed to pass it nationwide. California's bill <a href = "http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=36022">passed</a> [materials] earlier this month. There are similar bills pending in Alaska, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia.

<p>Proponents of the compact believe it is legal under <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II of the US Constitution</a> [text]: "[e]ach state shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors," which they contend gives state legislators a "blank check" to change the electoral process. They believe this was clarified by the landmark <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision, <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/bush_v._gore_2000">Bush v. Gore</a> [text]. The court wrote that voters only have rights in elections based on how state legislators dictate the election process. Detractors have suggested that the compact could violate the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1973.html">Voting Rights Act</a> [text]. There are also questions of whether the compact needs to be congressionally approved to upend the electoral college, but scholars have suggested that <A href = "http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=148&page=503">Virginia v. Tennessee</a> [text] allays this concern, in which the court ruled congressional consent is not necessary when a state compact does not threaten a federal issue. If enacted, the compact would effectively destroy the electoral college. Those in favor of this argue that presidential candidates will be forced to campaign in states that aren't regarded as "swing" states. Critics worry that candidates will further ignore small-population states as well as questioning the fairness of awarding electoral votes to the popular winner of the nation, not of that state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, entitled Acuerdo de Vida en Pareja, would extend inheritance and social welfare rights to same-sex couples and unmarried heterosexual couples. Pinera insisted that marriage is between a man and a women but acknowledged that other forms of relationships are effective and that the state is obligated to recognize, protect and respect those partnerships:<blockquote>This bill tries to equalize and not discriminate against opposite sex or same-sex couples, since, in both cases, it is possible to develop love, affection, respect and solidarity that naturally inspires communal living and commitment. We must understand that there is no single type of family; there are multiple forms or expressions of families. Consequently, in addition to the traditional or nuclear family consisting of parents united by marriage and children, there are many other families, such as single parents, extended, the cohabitants of different sexes or the same sex, families of blood relatives, and every one of these forms of family deserves respect and dignity, and will have the support of the state.</blockquote>Several members of the president's <a href="http://www.rn.cl/v1/">National Renewal Party</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-14469625">did not attend the proposal introduction and signing ceremony</a> [BBC report]. Many Chilean citizens oppose expanding the definition of marriage and Chile only recently legalized divorce in 2004.

<p>Foreign and domestic courts and legislatures are increasingly addressing the issue of gay marriage.

In April, Hungary added a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">prohibition against gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] to its constitution. France <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/france-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">upheld a same-sex marriage ban</a> [JURIST report] in January.

The letter demands that the council convene an emergency session, strongly condemn Syria, conduct public hearings on purported acts of violence, appoint a Special Rapporteur, and hold the Syrian government and military account for crimes against humanity:<blockquote>In the past week alone, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad has taken the lives of 200 innocent men, women and children in Hama, and dozens more in Deir al-Zour. We are deeply concerned that the council has failed to take prompt or effective action to protect the victims of Syrian mass killings. We regret that the council waited during months of bloodshed, while more than 400 were killed, before it held a single meeting in April. Although Syria was eventually condemned at that meeting, there has been no meaningful follow-up action for the victims.</blockquote>The organizations are led by <a href = "http://www.unwatch.org/site/c.bdKKISNqEmG/b.1277549/k.D7FE/UN_Watch__Monitoring_the_UN_Promoting_Human_Rights.htm">UN Watch</a> [advocacy website], a UN watchdog group. None of the nations on the council has commented on the letter, but several have supported Syria in the UN. China, Russia and Cuba defended Syria at the last council meeting, and the recent <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-security-council-condemns-syria-rights-abuses-and-use-of-force-against-civilians.php">condemnation</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] was only a reprimand because of Brazil, India and South Africa blocking a stronger measure. Also on Tuesday, it was reported that an unknown Western country is <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] investigation into Syria's recent human rights abuses. 

<p>There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. Last week, a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-experts-urge-syria-government-to-cease-violence-against-protesters.php">condemned the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] and called for a cessation of the continued use of lethal violence to suppress peaceful protests. The <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38702&Cr=syria&Cr1=">UN expressed concern</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-urges-nonviolence-in-syria.php">report</a>] over violence in Syria several times before that and urged the Syrian government to stop using force against protesters. In April, <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended </a>[JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued.

The 13 men are charged with armed insurrection and undermining the nation. Although Ivory Coast <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; <a href="http://lafrique.com/">political website</a>, in French] has insisted that all <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-president-says-all-responsible-for-post-election-violence-will-be-prosecuted-.php">those responsible for war crimes will be prosecuted</a> [JURIST report], none of his supporters has been charged or arrested. However, reports have alleged that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-reports-violence-continues-in-ivory-coast.php">violence is still being committed by Ouattara supporters</a> [JURIST report]. With the arrest of his son and the 12 others, all Gbagbo's political allies have been charged except for him and his wife.

<p>Earlier this month, Ouattara <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-sets-up-commission-to-investigate-post-election-violence.php">set up a commission of inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to investigate crimes and human rights violations that took place during post-election violence. Last month, he <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ivory-coast-signs-accord-allowing-icc-investigation-to-proceed.php">granted permission</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the violence following the presidential elections in which former president Gbagbo refused to leave office after losing the election. The Ivory Coast has already <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-issues-international-arrest-warrants-for-gbagbo-aides.php">issued international arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gbagbo aides, most notably for Charles Ble Goude, the leader of Gbagbo's youth militia, accusing him of inciting ethnic violence and attacks against UN workers. Other members of Gbagbo's government also had warrants issued including government spokesman Ahoua Don Mello, industry minister Phillipe Attey, and the ambassador to Israel Raymond Koudou Kessie. Twenty-one others already in detention were charged for violence and inciting tribalism and xenophobia. In April, Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured and forced from office</a> [JURIST report] after refusing to leave despite losing last November's election to Ouattara, which resulted in months of fighting between Ouattara's and Gbagbo's forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hoang reportedly joined the pro-democracy group <a href = "http://www.viettan.org/">Viet Tan</a> [political website, in Vietnamese], which is banned in Vietnam as a terrorist organization, and began to <a href = "http://english.vietnamnet.vn/en/society/11810/former-lecturer-sentenced-for-activities-aimed-at-overthrowing-gov-t.html">write anti-communist articles</a> [Vietnam.net report] on the Internet under his pen name. The government also accused him of teaching his students pro-democracy ideals. Some reports have suggested that Hoang was remorseful and confessed to all charges, but his wife <A href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14472932">insists he is innocent</a> [BBC report] and was merely exercising his right to free speech when he criticized the government. Viet Tan released a <a href = "http://www.viettan.org/spip.php?article11423">statement</a> [text, in Vietnamese] in support of Hoang later that day.<blockquote>[The] activities of Pham Minh Hoang were entirely the right thing to do. From signing petitions against China's bauxite mining in the Highlands and participating in seminars on national sovereignty in the South China Sea, to voicing criticism of the regime's mistakes and fighting for democracy, Pham Minh Hoang has the right to the conscience and duty of the people of Vietnam for the country. Even participation in a political party such as the Vietnam Reform Party (Viet Tan), peaceful activities to fight for his views is normal in any society that is truly free and includes democratic and human rights. Only in Vietnam, that did not stop them from conviction. The Communist Party wants to maintain a one-party dictatorship, not democracy and accept any difference any ideas.</blockquote>Viet Tan is California-based and generally considered a peaceful organization by most of the world. Hoang is a Vietnamese-French citizen after being naturalized in France when he studied there. Some attribute the leniency of his sentence to this factor. <a href = "www.europa.eu">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton <a href = "http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/124209.pdf">commented</a> [press release, PDF] on the sentence and called for Hoang's release. <a href = "http://en.rsf.org">Reporters Without Borders</a> [advocacy website] also <a href = "http://en.rsf.org/vietnam-french-vietnamese-blogger-10-08-2011,40766.html">criticized</a> [press release] the sentence. Hoang will also be on probation for three years after his release. Hoang's family said he plans to appeal.

<p>Vietnam has acquired a troubling record of jailing peaceful opposition forces. Earlier this month, a Vietnamese appeals court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/vietnam-appeals-court-upholds-7-year-sentence-for-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">upheld the seven-year sentence</a> of prominent rights lawyer and dissident Cu Huy Ha Vu, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/vietnam-rights-lawyer-jailed-after-calling-for-government-reform.php">convicted in April</a> [JURIST report] of carrying out anti-state propaganda. The court <a href="http://www.macon.com/2011/08/02/1652056/vietnam-dissident-calls-for-reforms.html">dismissed the appeal</a> [AP report] despite Vu's arguments that his advocating for a multi-party system did not mean he was against the Communist party. In January 2010, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to four years in prison on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. That same month, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion. Following the one-day trial, human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive] was sentenced to five years in prison. The four defendants were accused of activities aimed at ending communist rule in Vietnam. Dinh admitted to advocating multi-party democracy in Vietnam and joining the banned Democracy Party. Prior to Dinh's conviction, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] pro-democracy dissident Tran Anh Kim in December 2009 to five-and-a-half years in prison for subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/04/11/10-16645_opinion.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] an injunction in April before the law ever took effect, and Arizona is now asking the high court to address whether the state law is preempted by federal immigration legislation. The state maintains that the Ninth Circuit incorrectly concluded that the state law was facially preempted and "declined to determine whether there were constitutional applications" of the Arizona immigration legislation. The state and federal laws are compatible, Arizona argues:<blockquote>The baseline assumptions of our federal system are that States have inherent, plenary police power and that cooperative law enforcement is the norm. States, unlike federal agencies, are not creatures of the federal Congress and do not depend on federal statutes for authorization. It is, moreover, commonplace for state and federal law to prohibit the same conduct, and this Court has repeatedly emphasized that state officials are primarily governed by state law even when they cooperate with federal law enforcement officials. Thus, a conclusion that States are completely foreclosed from enforcing federal law or from enacting state laws that prohibit conduct made unlawful by Congress could be supported only by the clearest of congressional statements. Here, far from foreclosing such cooperative law enforcement efforts, the federal immigration laws expressly contemplate such cooperation and go so far as to compel federal cooperation with state efforts.</blockquote>Arizona urged the Supreme Court to grant <em>certiorari</em> because the question at issue is of "extraordinary importance," the decision below created a circuit split and the lower court decision is inconsistent with established precedent. The Supreme Court will likely <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/08/arizona-appeals-on-alien-control-law/">decide whether to hear the case</a> [SCOTUS blog report] when its term opens in October.

<p>In a preview of how it might rule should it decide to hear the case, the Supreme Court in May <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-115.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>] in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-coalition-seeks-to-block-additional-provisions-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] that Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azag.gov/LegalAZWorkersAct/">employment related immigration law</a> [materials] is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text]. Last year, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the state of Arizona and <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] over SB 1070, arguing that both the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country." The agency also claimed that the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and that the enforcement of the Arizona law is counterproductive to the national immigration policy. SB 1070, which criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in April of last year. The law faces several additional legal challenges including a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action law suit</a> [JURIST report] filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website] on behalf of a number of advocacy groups and several private individuals. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">challenge brought by several Tucson police officers</a> claiming the law could not be properly implemented without racially profiling was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-dismisses-police-officer-suit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] late last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mark Ciavarella Jr., a former judge in Pennsylvania's <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website], was accused of receiving nearly $1 million in kickbacks for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities in which he had a financial interest. A jury in the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/jury-reaches-mixed-verdict-over-pennsylvania-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">reached a split decision</a> [JURIST report] in April in Ciavarella's corruption trial, convicting him of 12 counts, including racketeering, money laundering and conspiracy, and acquitting him of 27 counts, including extortion. In a <a href="http://www.wbcitizensvoice.com/pdfs/ciavarella_memo.pdf">sentencing memorandum</a> [text, PDF] filed Monday, Ciavarella's attorneys urged the court to be lenient, pointing to, among other factors, the jury acquittals, Ciavarella's lack of criminal history and the original plea offer containing an 87-month sentence. The attorneys also argued that a long sentence would not be appropriate in Ciavarella's case:<blockquote>Mark can never again be a judge or lawyer. His life as a public office holder is over. A lengthy prison sentence does no more for the public's protection than a shorter sentence, or no sentence at all. The offense for which Ciavarella stands convicted is unique in that as a practical matter the perpetrator must never be involved in public affairs.</blockquote> The US Probation Office pre-sentence report indicated that Ciavarella was <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/08/11/former-judge-in-alleged-cash-for-kids-scheme-due-to-be-sentenced/">eligible for life in prison</a> [WSJ report] pursuant to federal sentencing guidelines.

<p>Ciavarella's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/former-pennsylvania-judge-goes-on-trial-over-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in early February. In July 2010, Judge Edwin Kosik <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.wbcitizensvoice.com/pdfs/conplea.pdf">plea agreement</a> [text, PDF] from former Pennsylvania judge Michael Conahan for his involvement in the juvenile sentencing scandal. Conahan now faces a 20-year prison sentence, a fine of up to $250,000 and disbarment. Kosik had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-accepts-plea-agreement-in-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] joint <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20090801_judges_memorandum.pdf">plea agreements</a> [text, PDF] from Conahan and Ciavarella, finding that plea bargaining to honest services fraud and tax evasion charges demonstrated that the men did not accept responsibility and that the disbarment and 87-month prison <a href="/forum/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">sentences were too lenient</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In October 2009, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/default.htm">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/OpPosting/Supreme/out/81mm2008pco6.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] 6,500 juvenile-offender <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/pennsylvania-court-overturns-thousands.php">convictions issued by Ciavarella</a> [JURIST report]. Conahan and Ciavarella were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> in September 2009, following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrawal</a> of the guilty pleas they <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">entered</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR62/006/2011/en/6cd862df-be60-418e-b70d-7d2d53a0a2d4/afr620062011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] states that the justice system has allowed the Congolese army and other armed groups to engage in a "cycle of violence and human rights violations for decades," alleging that the groups have engaged in torture, sexual violence and murder against citizens and that very few perpetrators have been brought to justice. AI called upon the DRC to prosecute all suspects under "international fair trial standards." AI cited to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/DRC_MAPPING_REPORT_FINAL_EN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-releases-long-awaited-report-on-human-rights-violations-in-drc.php">report</a>] issued by the UN last year, which documented the most serious violations of human rights, including violence against children, genocide and mass rape, committed in the DRC between 1993 and 2003. In response to the UN report, the DRC government proposed the creation of a special court to handle cases involving such serious rights violations. In addition to this specialized court, the AI report laid out several recommendations to further assist in strengthening the country's justice system. These recommendations include holding an international conference to develop a reform strategy, increasing the justice system budget, developing a legal aid program, abolishing the death penalty, providing greater protection to victims and witnesses, and adopting and enacting the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court</a> [text]. The AI also called on the UN, EU and other donors to provide financial and technical support to the DRC to ensure successful reform. AI said that the issue of <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/drc-neglected-congolese-victims-deserve-justice-now-2011-08-10">reform must be a priority</a> [statement] in the wake of the upcoming DRC presidential and legislative elections:<blockquote>In the run up to Presidential and Legislative elections in DRC due to take place in November 2011, bringing perpetrators of crimes under international law to justice and ensuring reparations for victims must not just be an electoral priority; it must be translated into concrete measures...The neglected victims of these terrible crimes need justice - they must be able to contribute to the reform process in a meaningful way and have their voices heard by the government.</blockquote>The report also points to poor conditions in the country's prison system. AI visited two local prisons and found that they were filled beyond capacity. The report calls for reform to prison conditions and also greater protections against escape.

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://monusco.unmissions.org/">UN Organization Stabilization Mission in DR Congo</a> (MONUSCO) in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/UNJHROReportMassRapesBushani_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-urges-drc-to-prosecute-perpetrators-of-mass-rapes.php">report</a>] accusing soldiers in the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) of committing mass rape. The report is the first to officially provide evidence that national forces perpetrated mass rape, as opposed to reports of <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rape-being-used-as-weapon-of-war-in-drc.php">opposition forces using it as a weapon</a> [JURIST report]. In May, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-urges-drc-to-strengthen-rule-of-law.php">called  for continued reforms</a> [JURIST report] in the DRC in order to strengthen the country's rule of law. DRC has been struggling with a number of human rights issues. In June, a military court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/congo-court-sentences-4-to-death-for-rights-activist-murder.php">sentenced four policemen to death</a> [JURIST report] for killing prominent human rights activist Floribert Chebeya last year. In early October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">called for the DRC government</a> [JURIST report] to arrest general Bosco Ntaganda pursuant to an outstanding warrant for war crimes issued by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Earlier that same week French authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-authorities-arrest-drc-war-crimes-suspect-under-icc-warrant.php">arrested a leader</a> [JURIST report] of the FDLR for crimes committed by that group in the DRC. In October, UN peacekeeping forces and the DRC government <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-forces-arrest-rebel-leader-for-drc-mass-rapes.php">arrested Mai Mai Cheka</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly leading a rebel group responsible for mass rapes in the country.  In December 2009, HRW urged MONUC to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/un-dr-congo-mission-urged-to-stop.php">stop funding military groups</a> [JURIST report] in the country that are committing human rights abuses. MONUC has been operating in DRC since 1999. The conflict in the DRC has claimed more than four million lives and has been ongoing since 1983. MONUC has overseen elections and continues to provide armed protection for civilians in certain areas, particularly the North and South Kivus provinces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Patek will be <a href = "http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/08/11/umar-patek-will-be-tried-under-criminal-code-police.html">charged</a> [<em>Jakarta Post</em> report] under the Indonesian criminal code rather than its terrorism laws. Reportedly, he will be charged with premeditated murder under the Emergency Law on Explosives. It is also alleged that Patek is in <a href = "http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/patek-says-he-built-bali-bomb-official/458639">poor psychological health</a> [<em>Jakarta Globe</em> report]. Patek was the last suspect at-large from the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing, and was captured in Abbottabad, Pakistan earlier this year. It is suspected he associated with <A href = "/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama Bin Laden</a> [JURIST news archive] while in Pakistan. It was not revealed whether Patek is a member of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8948/">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jemaah+Islamiyah">news archive</a>], the terrorist organization that conducted the bombing.

<p>JI claimed responsibility in the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings, which killed 202 people and injured 240 others. They were also implicated in the 2004 bombing of the US embassy in Jakarta and a series of further bombings in Bali during 2005. Last year, the Obama administration was considering bringing charges in a Washington, DC, federal court against <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2346225.stm">Riduan Isamuddin</a> [BBC profile], the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/us-considering-dc-trial-for-guantanamo.php">suspected planner</a> [JURIST report] of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing. Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, is the former military commander of JI and was allegedly the main link between JI and <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] before his capture in 2003.

The complaint alleges that Apple and publishing companies, including HarperCollins, Hachette Book Group, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &#38; Schuster, conspired to increase e-book prices in an effort to compete with e-books and the economically-priced <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store-ebooks-newspapers-blogs/b/ref=topnav_storetab_kinh?ie=UTF8&node=133141011">Kindle</a> [product page] sold by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> [corporate website]. Apple's incentive to collude, the complaint contends, was to increase its distribution of digital media using the Kindle as a platform. The complaint alleges that the agreement occurred sometime before January 2010 when a majority of the publishers announced a shift in their pricing models and Apple simultaneously released the iPad. As a result of the unlawful agreement, Amazon was forced to abandon its discount pricing and adhere to a new agency model, thereby causing e-book prices to increase by 30 to 50 percent. The lawsuit claims that the defendants' conduct constitutes violations of federal and state antitrust laws, the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a>, the <a href="http://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/3400/">Cartwright Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=17001-18000&file=17200-17210">Unfair Competition Act</a> [texts].

<p>Apple has been battling a number of lawsuits recently. In July, Apple prevailed in a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-htc.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=4">HTC</a> [corporate website] when the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (USITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">ruled against HTC</a> [JURIST report] for infringement of patents related to cell phones that run the Android operating system (OS). Apple <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-samsung.php">filed a complaint against Samsung</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month in an effort to bar importation of Samsung's smartphones and tablets. Apple claimed Samsung's "Galaxy" line copies its iPhone and iPad technology. The complaint came just a week after <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/samsung-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-apple.php">Samsung filed a similar complaint</a> [JURIST report] seeking to prevent Apple from importing iPads and iPhones. Samsung claimed that Apple violated five patents also related to smartphones and tablets. In addition, Samsung <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-30/samsung-sues-apple-in-london-following-u-s-iphone-ipad-patent-lawsuit.html">filed a patent infringement suit</a> [Bloomberg report] against Apple in the High Court in London in June. Finnish telecommunications company <a href="http://www.nokia.com/home">Nokia</a> [corporate website] announced in June that it had <a href="http://press.nokia.com/2011/06/14/nokia-enters-into-patent-license-agreement-with-apple/">entered into an agreement</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/apple-to-pay-nokia-royalties-in-settlement-of-patent-disputes.php">report</a>] with Apple, settling all patent disputes between the parties and directing Apple to pay royalties to Nokia for the term of the agreement. </p>]]></content:encoded>

There were also 85 arbitrary detentions by members of the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast (FRCI) reported. Both the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">UN</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-reports-violence-continues-in-ivory-coast.php">rights groups</a> [JURIST reports] have alleged that Outtara's forces have continued the violence of the <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">post-election civil war</a> [JURIST news archive], even after Ouattara took power. Although Ouattara has insisted that all <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-president-says-all-responsible-for-post-election-violence-will-be-prosecuted-.php">those responsible for war crimes will be prosecuted</a> [JURIST report], none of his supporters has been charged or arrested. On Wednesday, the son of former Ivory Coast president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile], Michel Gbagbo, and 12 other Gbagbo allies were <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/ivory-coast-presidents-son-12-others-charged-with-post-election-violence.php">charged with committing acts of post-election violence</a> [JURIST report]. With the arrest of his son and the 12 others, all Gbagbo's political allies have been charged except for him and his wife.

<p>Earlier this month, Ouattara <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-sets-up-commission-to-investigate-post-election-violence.php">set up a commission of inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to investigate crimes and human rights violations that took place during the violence following the presidential elections in which former president Gbagbo refused to leave office after losing the election. In April, Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured and forced from office</a> [JURIST report] after refusing to leave despite losing last November's election to Ouattara, which resulted in months of fighting between Ouattara's and Gbagbo's forces. Also that month, <A href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the FRCI killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. The <a href = "http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] also reported the deaths of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs filed a motion with District Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn asking to certify to the state court what the provisions of HB 56 that void contracts with undocumented aliens and make transporting them a crime mean in light of the Alabama's Constitution's <a href = "http://www.legislature.state.al.us/codeofalabama/constitution/1901/CA-170364.htm">religious freedom amendment</a> [text]. The Methodist, Episcopalian and Roman Catholic churches <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-seek-to-bar-alabama-immigration-law.php">joined the US government in fighting the law</a> [JURIST report] previously, arguing that the law criminalizes their missions as church leaders to provide mercy without having to verify immigration documentation. The Alabama attorney general is hoping the state court's answer will <a href = "http://progress.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110810/NEWS/110810012/Alabama-immigration-law-AG-wants-state-Supreme-Court-settle-religious-leaders-questions">moot the litigation</a> [<em>Prattville Progress</em> report].

<p>Alabama lawmakers earlier this week filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">response</a> [JURIST report] to groups seeking a preliminary injunction against the controversial immigration law. Attorneys for Alabama state officials, including <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website], argue that the state law is not preempted by federal immigration law and that the text reflects a "spirit of cooperation with the federal government." Lawsuits filed by the US <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">Department of Justice</a> [JURIST report], the Methodist, Episcopalian and Roman Catholic churches and three dozen plaintiffs represented by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites], were consolidated last week. The Alabama immigration legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by Governor Bentley in June, is one of the most rigid immigration reform laws passed recently. In addition to authorizing detention of individuals on reasonable suspicion they are illegal immigrants, the law provides harsh restrictions on employment for illegal immigrants. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. Sixteen countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed briefs</a> [JURIST report] in the Alabama district court against the controversial Alabama immigration law last week, arguing that the recently enacted law <a href="http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110803/NEWS/110803045/Mexico-16-other-nations-file-briefs-against-Alabama-immigration-law?odyssey=mod%7Cbreaking%7Ctext%7CFrontpage">unfairly treats citizens</a> [<em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> report] of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Council of Ministers see that the time has come to leave all Egyptians to work freely in order to compensate for the lost country of production and rise to the aspirations of the people in the levels of quality of life.</blockquote>The government also alleged that <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE77A3EH20110811?sp=true">they have not utilized any of the powers</a> [Reuters report] granted by the state of emergency.

<p>Protests continue in Egypt as many believe the interim government is not progressing toward change quickly enough. In April, an Egyptian military court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-military-court-convicts-blogger-for-insulting-army.php">convicted blogger Maikel Nabil</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced him to three years in prison for criticizing the army and raising questions over reform in the wake of revolution. He <a href="http://www.maikelnabil.com/2011/03/blog-post_07.html">posted an article on his blog</a> [text, in Arabic] on March 7 saying the army had beaten, tortured and killed protesters, including some who were cooperating with security forces. He was then sentenced without a formal hearing and without his lawyers present. In March, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces unveiled an interim constitution that allows the council to retain control over the country until an elected government is installed. The document vests the military council with <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8953/Egypt/Politics-/Armed-Forces-announces-Egypts-interim-Constitution.aspx">presidential powers</a> [<em>Al-Ahram</em> report], including the abilities to introduce legislation, veto existing laws and act as Egypt's representative to the international community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.cja.org/">Center for Justice and Accountability</a> (CJA) and the <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/">New York Civil Liberties Union</a> (NYCLU) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/advocacy-groups-petition-for-investigation-of-guantanamo-psychologist.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the New York State Department of Education <a href="http://www.op.nysed.gov/">Office of Professional Discipline</a> (OPD) [official website] last year to force a professional misconduct investigation. The OPD filed a <a href="http://cja.org/downloads/NYAGMTD%201.14.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> [motion, PDF] the case for lack of standing:<blockquote>Petitioner's only claimed injury is that the OPD refused to investigate Dr. Leso based on [a previously filed] complaint. This is patently insufficient to constitute an "injury in fact," as petitioner fails to allege that he suffered an actual harm, much less one "different in kind or degree from that suffered by the public at large." ... Petitioner nowhere alleges that the OPD's decision personally impacted him or his practice.</blockquote>Manhattan Civil Court Judge Saliann Scarpulla agreed, ruling the case does not meet state legal requirements for standing in challenging state government actions.

<p>The lawsuit stemmed from the CJA's previously filed <a href="http://cja.org/downloads/Leso%20Complaint.Final.07.07.2010.pdf">licensing complaint</a> [text, PDF] against Leso. The OPD <a href="http://cja.org/downloads/No.%202.%20NYOP%20Denial%20of%20Jurisdiction.7.28.10.pdf">denied jurisdiction</a> [ruling, PDF] over the complaint on the grounds that Leso's conduct was not consistent with the practice of psychology as defined under New York law, and therefore was not governed by New York rules of professional ethics. The complaint has been one of many condemnations of Guantanamo Bay medical professionals. One year before this complaint was filed, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList2/Home?OpenDocument">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> [official website] reported that medical professionals <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/red-cross-report-alleges-guantanamo.php">violated codes of medical ethics</a> [JURIST report] by participating in and assisting in ill-treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Scheungraber has consistently claimed innocence, and his lawyer, Gunter Widmaier, has been appealing his conviction since 2009. It was only recently that claims of mental inability to grasp the penal system surfaced, with the prosecutor ordering an independent medical review, which has convinced many in the office that Scheungraber is unfit to serve his sentence in Germany. Scheungraber is reportedly suffering from calcification of the brain, and his health will deteriorate drastically in prison. Italian judicial counterparts, who also sentenced him to life in prison, have not weighed in on the case. Scheungraber was sentenced to life in prison for the 1944 reprisal killing of 10 Italian civilians. Scheungraber was convicted of 10 counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for ordering soldiers to blow up a barn in <a href = "http://resistenzatoscana.it/monumenti/cortona/monumento_di_falzano/">Falzano di Cortona, Tuscany</a> [memorial website, in Italian] after forcing 11 civilians inside.

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, prosecutions of Nazis continue around the world. Earlier this month, both the prosecution and the defense in the case of alleged Nazi Sandor Kepiro have announced they will be <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/hungary-acquittal-of-accused-nazi-to-be-appealed-by-prosecution-defense.php">appealing</a> a Hungarian court's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/hungary-court-drops-war-crimes-charges-against-accused-nazi.php">decision to acquit</a> [JURIST reports]. Kepiro was acquitted of participating in the 1942 Novi Sad massacre in Serbia. In May, the trial of accused Nazi guard <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Demjanjuk">news archive</a>] ended when he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] but released because of his advanced age. An <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/german-prosecutors-vow-to-appeal-demjanjuk-release.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] of his release is pending. In November, Nazi guard <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profile.html?tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=samuel_kunz_936">Samuel Kunz</a> [Trial Watch profile], 89, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/former-nazi-prison-guard-dies-while-awaiting-trial.php">passed away</a> [JURIST report] in his home before he could be brought to trial.

The judge stated Tymoshenko had no legal grounds to contest her recent arrest. Tymoshenko plans on <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/vx7xm95o">appealing</a> [press release] to both the <a href = "http://www.scourt.gov.ua/">Ukraine Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] and the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. Defense lawyer Yuriy Sukhov stressed the unfairness of recent rulings against Tymoshenko:<blockquote>There is no justice in Ukraine. This is judicial lawlessness, when a person is arrested and she can't appeal this decision. It's absurd. In its decision the court referred to the fact that we based our appeal on the Constitution and Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which says that national legislation must provide the opportunity to appeal an order of arrest. And even if the laws don't, then the institution of appeal must make a decision based on the Convention. The judges provided no justification for her decision. She said that Ukrainian law does not provide for appeal. She doesn't refer to international law or the Constitution, and just says that national law, meaning the Criminal Procedure Code, doesn't provide for appeal. It's absurd.</blockquote>Tymoshenko's trial will continue on Monday.

<p>Last week, Ukrainian Judge Rodion Kireyev <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. Kireyev <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/8csvmm6e">again refused to recuse himself</a> the week before, and Tymoshenko announced that she was allowed to call only <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/soscx239">two of her proposed witnesses</a> [press releases]. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. Last month, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ECHR alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. ECHR President Jean Paul Costa <a target="_blank" href="http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/1235011-v-espch-ne-kommentiruyut-perspektivu-iskov-timoshenko-k-ukraine">refused to comment on the complaint</a> [<em>Korrespondent</em> report, in Russian], but said the matter was before the court. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Antonio Cassese guaranteed a fair trial and adequate representation and pressed Lebanese citizens to allow the STL to hold the assassins accountable. Cassese also guaranteed that the STL will find a way to carry out its missions even if no one complies with its orders.<blockquote>Let me also remind all those allegedly involved in those terrorist crimes in Lebanon that nothing, I repeat, nothing will deflect or prevent the Tribunal from fulfilling its mission. The lofty ideals on which the Tribunal is grounded (accountability, dispensation of justice to contribute to long-term peace and reconciliation, safeguarding the rights of the victims) are solidly ingrained in our Statute and our Rules and jealously protected by the Judges. They cannot be set aside by a stroke of the pen, by mere rhetoric or even by violence. The march to justice is inexorable, and one way or another we will end up with a trial. I therefore strongly appeal to the accused to take advantage of the broad legal possibilities offered by our Rules of Procedure and Evidence, thereby contributing to the establishment of truth and the conduct of fair proceedings.</blockquote>Arrest <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-files-4-indictments-in-hariri-assasination-investigation.php">warrants were issued</a> [JURIST report] in June for Mustafa Badreddine, Salim al-Ayyash, Hasan Aineysseh and Asad Sabra, who are <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2011/Jun-30/STL-delegation-meets-with-state-prosecutor.ashx#axzz1Qm6bjcSK">alleged members</a> [<em>Lebanon Daily Star</em> report] of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder].

<p>In February, the appeals chamber of the STL issued a unanimous <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/News/Summary%20of%20Decision_16%20February%20%28EN%29.pdf">ruling</a> [summary, PDF] on several procedural issues, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-defines-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">including the definition of terrorism</a> [JURIST report], in judicial proceedings. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine which laws to apply in the case against persons accused of involvement in the February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. Using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Article 314 of the Lebanese Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF], the court held that a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger," that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case. Last August, Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">submitted evidence to the STL</a> [JURIST report] linking Israel with the bombing. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">asked for the evidence</a> [JURIST report] a week earlier after Hezbollah Secretary General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile] claimed to have proof that Israel was behind the bombing. The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

All five of the sentenced pirates were discovered in a navy supply ship off the coast of Somalia earlier this year, and while all five were convicted of piracy, two were also convicted of hijacking. Judge Jacco Janssen rejected the suspects' arguments that the poverty and famine in Somalia is a justification for piracy. The ruling also denounced piracy as an attack on the global economy:<blockquote>In its judgement the court has noted that pirates often use extreme violence, leading to tremendous suffering among the crew members whom they take hostage in order to collect ransom moneys. The court has emphasized that piracy in the Gulf of Aden has turned into a significant threat for all ships that frequent that region. The free and unfettered transport of cargo, resources and fuels can no longer be guaranteed. Global economic consequences can no longer be ruled out.</blockquote>Two of the accused were proven to be involved in an attack on a South African yacht, the Choizil. In the attack, several pirates got away with two hostages, Bruno Pelizzari and Debbie Calitz, who are still being held for USD $10 million ransom. Reportedly, the two pirates involved in the attack on the Choizil, utilized <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gjK7Qguj6I0HQbo5Sn_QKTYqL48Q?docId=CNG.1dbda76336400d092358c2558c36e01d.6b1">automatic weapons and a rocket launcher</a> [AFP report].

<p>Last month, three accused Somali pirates <A href = "/paperchase/2011/07/accused-somali-pirates-plead-not-guilty-in-hijacking-that-killed-4-americans.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to hijacking a US vessel that resulted in the deaths of four US citizens. In March, a grand jury in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia indicted 14 suspects, 13 Somali and one Yemeni, for hijacking the Quest. The Yemeni suspect <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/yemeni-pirate-pleads-guilty-to-hijacking-vessel-that-killed-4-us-citizens.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in July and awaits sentencing scheduled for October. Several other suspects <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/two-more-somali-pirates-plead-guilty-in-us-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in May. Earlier this month, five Somali pirates <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/5-somalis-go-on-trial-for-piracy-in-dutch-court.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in a Dutch court for hijacking a South African yacht and kidnapping its crew.

The original injunction by the <a href = "http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/">Maricopa County Superior Court</A> [official website] held the following provisions as "undue burdens" on a woman's right to an abortion: prohibitions on anyone but a licensed physician performing an abortion; a requirement that women meet with the doctor personally 24 hours before an abortion (the injunction held that a phone call would suffice); that medical professionals have a right to refuse to perform even medically necessary abortions, provide certain contraceptives or the "morning after" pill; and a mandate that parents' consent forms allowing their child to get an abortion be notarized. The appeals court reinstated all of these stipulations, suggesting that the lower judge had applied "strict scrutiny" in error rather than an "undue burden" test.<blockquote>To be sure, the drafters of the Arizona Constitution deliberately created an individual right of privacy that is not expressly set forth in the federal Bill of Rights. But the specific and limited regulations here, substantial equivalent of which have already been held not to offend the penumbral right of privacy that gave rise to federal abortion rights, do not implicate fundamental rights that are in any way unique to Arizona, its history or the intent of the framers of its Constitution. The fundamental rule of judicial restraint is to avoid constitutional questions unless "absolutely necessary" to decide the case. Therefore, because Arizona&#8217;s citizens may "assert the right to choose as defined and articulated by the United States Supreme Court," we too "reach no conclusion about whether the Arizona Constitution provides a right of choice."</blockquote><a href = "http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppaz/">Planned Parenthood of Arizona</a> [advocacy website], a party to the original suit, said the law's enactment will have a <a href = "http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_dd27da53-d123-5154-a798-f2fce4469358.html">severe impact</a> [<em>Arizona Daily Star</em> report] on women in the state, many of whom have to take day-trips to have abortions. It is unknown if they will appeal.

<p>Earlier this year, Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] signed into law a bill <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/arizona-governor-outlaws-abortion-based-on-sex-or-race.php">outlawing abortions performed based on the sex or race of the fetus</a> [JURIST report]. Representative Steve Montenegro sponsored <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=HB2442&Session_ID=102">HB 2442</a> and <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=HB2443&Session_ID=102">HB 2443</a> [legislative materials], which separately outlaw abortions based on the child's sex or race. Under the new abortion law, a physician or health professional who does not report known or suspected violations will face felony charges and civil fines and may be liable for damages. In May, a judge for the <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/drupal6/">US District Court for the District of South Dakota</a> [official website] issued a <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/docs/16511449869c5cb1ed1[1].pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF] blocking a South Dakota <a href = "http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Bill=1217">abortion regulation</a> [HB 1217] requiring a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-south-dakota-abortion-law-with-72-hour-waiting-period.php">72-hour waiting period</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href = "http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] rejected the entirety of the law, the Eleventh Circuit judges upheld the law without the mandate. The opinion stated that Congress had exceeded its authority under the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], calling it a "wholly novel and potentially unbounded assertion of congressional authority." They also agreed with the defendants that the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text] powers reserved to the states were usurped by Congress: "Congress cannot directly compel a state to act, nor can Congress hinge the state's right to regulate in an area that the state has a constitutional right to regulate on the state's participation in a federal program. Either act is clearly unconstitutionally coercive." The dissent, by Judge Stanley Marcus, disagreed:<blockquote>Setting aside the lack of <em>any</em> precedent on point, a Tenth Amendment challenge to the individual mandate fails for an additional, and critical, reason: when a federal law is properly within Congress' delegated power to enact, the Tenth Amendment poses no limit on the exercise of that power. Since the individual mandate falls within Congress' commerce power, its enactment is a proper exercise of a power "delegated to the United States by the Constitution." The Tenth Amendment, therefore, has no individual role to play. In short, the plaintiffs' individual liberty claims find little support in the Constitution&#8212;whether pegged to the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause or the Tenth Amendment's reservation of power to the people. At bottom, Congress rationally concluded that the uninsured's consumption of health care services, in the aggregate, shifts enormous costs on to others and thus substantially affects interstate commerce.</blockquote>A spokesperson for President Barack Obama <a href = "http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/08/12/latest-health-care-court-case">said</a> [press release] the administration "strongly disagree[s] with this decision and we are confident it will not stand." Also on Friday, the <a href = "http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that Ohioans are entitled to a petition-driven ballot initiative that could <a href = "http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2011/08/12/Ohio-top-court-rejects-challenge-to-referendum-issue-on-mandated-health-care.html">potentially block the PPACA in the state</a> [<em>Toledo Blade</em> report].

<p><a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/eleventh-circuit-hears-arguments-on-constitutionality-of-new-health-care-law.php">Oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the Eleventh Circuit's review of the PPACA were heard in June. Former solicitor general Paul Clement, representing Florida and 26 other states backing the lawsuit, argued that Congress has never before used the Commerce Clause power to force citizens to purchase something. The <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] argued that the choice not to purchase insurance affects everyone. Also in June, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law's-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">found the individual mandate provision constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The court determined that the penalty is not a tax for purposes of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26.html">Internal Revenue Code</a> [text] and went on to state that the health care market "is large and is inextricably linked to interstate commerce" and that those who choose to not purchase health insurance substantially affect interstate commerce through cost-shifting that drives up insurance premiums. As a result, the Court determined that Congress did not violate the Commerce Clause, finding it had a rational basis for the individual mandate because "the provision regulates active participation in the health care market, and in any case, the Constitution imposes no categorical bar on regulating inactivity." The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] over PPACA in May but has not yet issued a ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Nancy Freudenthal ruled that administrative memos restricting <a href="http://environment.fhwa.dot.gov/projdev/docuce.asp">categorical exemptions</a> [US DOT backgrounder] to environmental impact restrictions under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:h6eas.txt.pdf">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a> [text, PDF] represented an undue burden on energy companies by delaying drilling operations and adding to their cost. The <a href="http://westernenergyalliance.org/">Western Energy Alliance</a> (WEA) [advocacy website] <a href="http://westernenergyalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Western-Energy-Alliance-IPAMS-Categorical-Exclusions-Complaint-10-21-10.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html">US Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM) [official website], the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/">National Forest Service</a> (NFS) [official website] and Secretary of the Interior <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Ken Salazar</a> [official biography] last October. The government argued unsuccessfully that the harms complained of were merely speculative, and Judge Freudenthal agreed with WEA's arguments that the rules were promulgated in violation of the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [materials] and inconsistent with the plain language mandate of the 2005 Act. 

<p>The BLM issued an <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/regulations/Instruction_Memos_and_Bulletins/national_instruction/2010/IM_2010-118.html">administrative memorandum</a> [text] in March 2010 restricting the scope of those exceptions, allowing exceptions under &#167; 390 of the 2005 Act only where a site or operation is within close physical proximity to a previous one, where a site is subject to a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [materials]-sanctioned land plan, and where the operator completes additional reporting requirements. The NFS followed suit with <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/geology/June_2010%20guidance%20Sec%20%20390%20CE.pdf">its own memo</a> [text, PDF] to the same effect in June. The ruling removes the 2010 restrictions, reinstating the Bush administration-era regime of expedited oil and gas drilling provisions under which provides categorical exceptions for all oil and gas drilling operations on federal land where a minimal degree of environmental disturbance is expected or where wells are subsequently tapped after an impact survey was performed at the first drilling. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Brown was indicted on five counts in 2003 stemming from a 1999 transaction in which Merrill took a $28 million equity interest in a facility of barge-mounted power generators on the Nigerian coast along with Enron. The transaction, in which Merrill paid Enron $7 million and loaned $21 million more was ultimately exposed as a "sham sale" designed only to "allow Enron to artificially enhance its fourth-quarter earnings to meet forecasts."  Brown served as the director in charge of Merrill's Strategic Asset and Lease Finance group at the time. With three of the charges <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/doj-ends-efforts-to-retry-merrill-lynch-executives-in-enron-scam.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report], Brown was <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/former-enron-vp-four-bankers-convicted.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report], along with three other former Merrill executives, in 2004 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. Brown challenged his convictions on the grounds that the government violated his right to due process by "withholding materially favorable evidence that it possessed pre-trial," specifically a set of FBI notes from an interview of Enron CFO Andrew Fastow, Senate investigators' notes from an interview with Enron Treasurer Jeff McMahon and transcripts of testimony delivered by Merrill Lynch Chief Counsel Katherine Zrike delivered to a grand jury and the <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website].  The court held that the evidence in question was not material and thus, under <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=373&page=83">Brady v. Maryland</a> [opinion], insufficient to overturn Brown's conviction:<blockquote>Brown points to the divided panel in Brown I to argue that the case against him was relatively weak. It is true that the panel was divided on Brown's guilt, but that division was over whether a legally unenforceable oral promise could establish Brown's guilt, not whether there was an oral promise at all [as documented in the undisclosed FBI evidence]. . . . The alleged <em>Brady</em> evidence in this appeal only addresses the latter issue . . . It thus does not call the majority's holding in Brown I into question, and we have no authority to relitigate the issue that divided the panel. In short, the district court did not commit reversible error in holding that the <em>Brady</em> items, taken together, did not create a reasonable probability of a different outcome.</blockquote>The Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C05/05-20319-CR0.wpd.pdf">overturned fraud and conspiracy convictions</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-overturns.php">report</a>] against Brown in 2006 "on the legal ground that the government's theory of fraud relating to the deprivation of honest services &#8212; one of three theories of fraud charged in the Indictment &#8212; is flawed." Enron CEO <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jeffrey+Skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a> [JURIST news archive] was also absolved of fraud charges when the Supreme Court's interpreted the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001346----000-.html">"honest service" doctrine</a> [18 USC &#167; 1346] narrowly in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1394">Skilling v. United States</a> [Cornell II backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-enron-ex-ceo-appeal.php">report</a>]. Although the Court's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1394.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] did not overturn the rule as unconstitutionally vague, it limited its application only to instances of bribery and kickbacks.]]></content:encoded>

Wang is charged with <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i4Mw_nCi9ggPWjoO-caMPcPMfGuQ?docId=CNG.1cc437d7d61fc59f3394a87a1a28abbb.201">one count of creating a disturbance</a> [AFP report] for allegedly utilizing the Internet to attempt organizing anti-government demonstrations during the recent period of similar unrest in Middle Eastern and African countries. Her supporters contend that the offense of "creating a disturbance" is purposefully ambiguous, and that it is frequently levied against vocal government opponents. Wang was arrested in April, shortly before the anniversary of the peaceful <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder] protests of June 1989. In the months prior to the occasion, the government arrested at least 48 individuals in what rights group <a href="http://chrdnet.org/">Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [advocacy website] <a href="http://chrdnet.org/2011/06/02/twenty-two-years-after-tiananmen-massacre-worst-repression-in-a-generation/">described</a> [press release] as the "most severe repression of dissent and activism since the post-Tiananmen crackdown." A contingent of several international diplomats, including representatives from the United States and European Union, sought to attend the proceedings but were denied entry. If convicted, Wang faces a maximum of five years incarceration.

<p>China's human rights record has been widely criticized. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] in June <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government to release protesters arrested for their Tiananmen Square involvement and account for those missing or killed during the suppression. The State Department also urged China to protect universal human rights afforded to peaceful dissenters, and to release those that had been detained or placed under house arrest in the months prior. In May, the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] called for the immediate release of Chinese rights activist and Nobel Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>].

China has also been criticized for jailing human rights attorney <a href="http://www.freegao.com/">Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zhisheng">news archive</a>]. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-panel-urges-china-to-release-detained-human-rights-lawyer.php">called on the Chinese government</a> [JURIST report] in March to free Gao, claiming his detention violates international law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report describes a "systematic pattern" of coercive, threatening and physically abusive behavior, often accompanied by property damage, theft and evidence tampering. Documented complaints of human rights violations allegedly committed by authorities rose from 234 in 2006 to 964 in 2008, the same year a law was enacted easing requirements for search warrants. Per the report's projections, such complaints are expected to surpass 1,000 by the close of this year.

<p>Following the April <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mexico-attorney-general-resigns-amid-criticism.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] of former Mexican Attorney General Arturo Chavez, the <a href="http://www.pgr.gob.mx/ingles/que%20es%20pgr/presentation.asp">Attorney General's Office</a> (PGR) [official website] last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mexico-ag-purges-office-charges-111-officials-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 111 officials who served under Chavez with various corruption-related offenses, including falsifying documents, interfering with the administration of justice, abuse of power, perjury and bribery. Additionally, 140 police officers were fired and it was disclosed that 280 more are under investigation. Mexico has struggled to combat the drug cartels' influence on the government and the country as a whole. There have been <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20101215-mexico-and-cartel-wars-2010?utm_source=SWeekly&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=101216&utm_content=readmore&elq=b1b5d866b6a74b31a7b5ad7de5742eaf">more than 27,000 drug-related deaths</a> [STRATFOR report] since 2006, and the violence has steadily escalated over the past few years. In April 2009, Mexico's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/mexico-senate-approves-pre-conviction.php">passed a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] permitting the seizure of suspected drug traffickers' property prior to their conviction.

Judge Ahmed Rifaat ordered four recesses in the first three hours of the morning's proceedings in response to conduct by defense counsel that he believed was disruptive and disorganized.  Defense counsel was never able to present its case in the course of the session.  The trial is set to resume September 5.  El-Adly and Egypt's former president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>] face charges of killing pro-democracy protesters during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year.

<p>El-Adly's trial resumed on August 3 after being <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">delayed late last month</a> [JURIST report]. El-Adly, who was already serving a 12-year prison sentence, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/egypt-court-convicts-ex-pm-of-corruption.php">sentenced to five years</a> [JURIST report] in July on corruption charges. Former finance minister Yousef Boutros and former prime minister Ahmed Nazif, along with el-Adly, were ordered to return USD $15 million for a no-bid contract, while Boutros and el-Adly were also fined nearly USD $17 million. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters, and el-Adly's testimony could help prove Mubarak was an accomplice to the killings. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report], and more than 6,000 were injured, during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The request calls for a cessation of the upcoming hunting season until the groups' appeal of a federal court decision is determined.  Environmentalists believe that the wolf hunts should be prohibited <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/environment/environmental-groups-seek-emergency-injunction-to-halt-wolf-hunts-in-idaho-montana/2011/08/13/gIQApEveDJ_story.html">until the population reaches between 2,000 to 5,000 wolves</a> [AP report].  The motion states:<blockquote>[B]eginning within the next 21 days, hundreds of Gray Wolves that should be protected as endangered species are about to be hunted and killed.  Appellants' interests in protecting both individual Gray Wolves in Idaho and Montana and the Gray Wolf population in the Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf Distinct Population Segment outside of Wyoming are about to be irreparably injured.

The <a href="http://www.wildrockiesalliance.org/index.html">Alliance for the Wild Rockies</a> (AWR), <a href="http://www.friendsoftheclearwater.org/">Friends of the Clearwater</a> and <a href="http://www.wildearthguardians.org/site/PageServer">WildEarth Guardians</a> [advocacy websites] are seeking to reverse the judgment handed down by the lower court, which <a href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/missoulian.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/e5/4e5a103c-be2e-11e0-80fc-001cc4c03286/4e39e3b35598e.pdf.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/montana-judge-allows-congress-to-remove-wolves-from-endangered-species-list.php">report</a>] that Congress did not violate the Constitution when it effectively overturned the court's previous ruling striking down a 2009 delisting rule issued by the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/">US Fish and Wildlife Service</a> [official website]. The rule <a href="http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/wolf/74FR15123.pdf">removed</a> [federal registrar, PDF] the <a href="http://www.yellowstoneinsider.com/issues/wolves/wolves-in-yellowstone-a-short-history/all-pages.php">Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf</a> [Yellowstone Insider backgrounder] from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/esa.html">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) [materials] protection list in all areas outside of Wyoming. The Ninth Circuit was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/environmental-groups-to-appeal-federal-ruling-allowing-endangered-wolf-hunting.php">notified</a> [JURIST report] last week that the groups were planning on challenging the lower court's ruling.

<p>The wolves were removed from the shelter of the ESA after a controversial Interior Department memo was published that several animals should be taken off the list despite their numbers not being at a sustainable level. The delisting order leaves the wolves under the purview of the Montana and Idaho state governments. Montana began selling <a href="http://fwpiis.mt.gov/content/getItem.aspx?id=51629">wolf hunting licenses</a> [state hunting regulations, PDF] on the same day as Molloy's ruling. There is no limit on the number of licenses sold, but the hunting season will be closed in hunting districts around the state as regional quotas are reached. Montana hunters will be able to shoot as many as 220 gray wolves in Montana in a hunt scheduled to begin in early September, first with an archery season and then later with a rifle season. The state expects that the hunt will reduce the predator's Montana population by about 25 percent to a minimum 425 wolves. Environmentalists say they believe the population will be reduced further than that.<br />

Mubarak is on trial for murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">general abuse of power</a> [Al Jazeera report] stemming from his response to pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year. Presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/world/7079810-418/egyptian-judge-stops-live-mubarak-trial-broadcasts.html">decided to end live TV broadcasts</a> [AP report] of subsequent proceedings amid protests from the families of victims and praise from several courtroom lawyers who opposed the broadcasts. Mubarak's sons Gamal and Alaa, who are also on trial for corruption charges, <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/international/middle_east/view/20110815egypts_hosni_mubarak_back_in_court_for_trial/srvc=home&position=recent">were present</a> [AP report] in the defendants' cage on Monday. Rifaat ultimately adjourned the trial until September 5 when other officials are scheduled to face charges related to killing protestors.

<p>Mubarak's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">began on August 3</a> [JURIST report] with Mubarak and his sons pleading not guilty to all charges. Officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place at a convention center in downtown Cairo. The announcement <a target="_blank" href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE76R1S820110728?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">came amid speculation</a> [Reuters report] that the trial would take place at a Red Sea resort because of Mubarak's alleged poor health. Many Egyptians contend that Mubarak is not ill and that members of the government have claimed the ex-president is sick in an effort to avoid a swift, public trial. In July, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, so it would coincide with Mubarak's trial. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters. <a target="_blank" href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report] and more than 6,000 injured during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Serbia contends that Avram Nika, convicted of killing of a man who had stopped to help him on a highway in Nevada, <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/08/14/3076088/serbia-seeks-to-block-execution.html">would have been provided with better assistance</a> [AP report] and counsel had the consulate offices been notified of his arrest pursuant to international law. District Attorney Dick Gammick said that no Serbian consulate office could be contacted when Nika was arrested because Serbia was not a country at the time. Katherine Bekesi, an investigator for prisoner human rights advocacy group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/2011_08_12_Serbia_Nika_amicus/">called for a new trial</a> [press release]:<blockquote>If the Serbian consulate had been informed of Mr. Nika's arrest, it would have provided crucial assistance, including translation, legal advice and key mitigating evidence, which could have saved Mr. Nika's life. The state of Nevada must face up to its deplorable failings in this case and order a new trial.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.nevadajudiciary.us/index.php/supremecourt">Nevada Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/nv-supreme-court/1118811.html">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] Nika's request to overturn his conviction in December 2008, with the dissent suggesting jurors did not have enough information to evaluate Nika's guilt and the majority holding that a consulate office could have done little to change the guilty verdict.

<p>Just last month, the government of Mexico <a href="http://tcadp.org/2011/06/28/u-s-supreme-court-urged-to-stay-execution-of-humberto-leal-garcia/">pleaded</a> [press release] with the US to block the execution of Mexican national <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/">Humberto Leal Garcia</a> [advocacy website] on similar grounds. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-us-execution-of-mexico-national-violated-international-law.php">criticized the execution</a> [JURIST report], saying that the US <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11214&amp;LangID=E">denied consular access</a> [press release] to Leal Garcia, which was his right under <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [text, PDF]. Officials from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] had appealed unsuccessfully to Texas <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-urges-texas-to-halt-execution.php">report</a>] and the <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/bpp/">Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles</a> [official website] to stay the execution. The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution-of-mexican-national.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution, with the majority in a split <em>per curiam</em> opinion rejecting the Obama administration's arguments that Leal Garcia's execution would be detrimental to foreign policy to the degree that they needed to introduce a stay. Texas officials <a href="http://www.ktsm.com/news/texas-executes-mexican-after-court-stay-rejected">executed</a> [KTSM report] Leal Garcia an hour after the decision. Texas has already <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/texas-executes-second-foreign-national.php">executed two Mexican nationals</a> [JURIST report] who were denied consular access.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) and the former <a href="http://unmis.unmissions.org/">UN Mission in Sudan</a> (UNMIS) [official websites] issued a preliminary <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/13thSouth_Kordofan_report.doc">report</a> [text, DOC] describing human rights conditions following armed combat in Kadugli in June between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army North (SPLAN). Alleged violations include "extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and illegal detention, enforced disappearances, attacks against civilians, looting of civilian homes and destruction of property," as well as indiscriminate aerial attacks and mass graves. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged the Sudanese government to ensure access to areas under investigation:<blockquote>It is vital that unhindered access is granted to human rights monitors to conduct investigations into allegations of continuing violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, and to humanitarian actors trying to bring relief to the affected populations whose access has also been severely restricted by both sides.</blockquote>Pillay also called for the immediate release of UN staffers and detainees who have not committed any crimes.

<p>South Kordofan, which has been held by the SPLA since the 2005 peace deal that stifled Sudan's civil war, is a state in the center of Sudan, and has been a disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan due to its oil reserves. In July, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-calls-for-end-to-fighting-in-disputed-sudan-kordofan-region.php">called for an end to the fighting</a> [JURIST report] that had been ongoing since early June. The UN Under-Secretary-General for <a href="http://www.un.org/en/humanitarian/">Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] and Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=145">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] <a href="http://reliefweb.int/node/421571">denounced continued human rights abuses</a> [statement] against civilians in the South Kordofan region in June, saying that the UN knows of more than 70,000 people who have been displaced by the conflict, many of whom are subject to violence due to their ethnic heritage. The SAF took over Abyei in May, causing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-peaceful-resolution-of-sudan-conflict.php">rebuke</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-security-council-demands-removal-of-sudan-troops-from-disputed-region.php">demand for withdrawal</a> [JURIST reports] by the UN. The UN confirmed reports of bombing and shelling in and around Abyei by the SAF, as well as widespread looting and burning of houses. Aid workers <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13549157">estimate 40,000 people have fled the area</a> [BBC report]. While the UN has said that attacks on its peacekeepers amount to war crimes under international law, both the UN and the US have called on the northern troops to withdraw from Abyei. From the northern capital of Khartoum <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bashir">news archive</a>] has stated he will not withdraw troops from the region and insisted that the area belongs to the north. An <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] case is open against al-Bashir and several nations have been urged to arrest him on sight including <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/china-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">China</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/malaysia-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">Malaysia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">Djibouti</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">Kenya</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-al-bashir-will-be-arrested.php">Chad</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a report entitled <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia0811webwcover.pdf">"You Don't Know Who To Blame: War Crimes in Somalia"</a> [text, PDF], HRW describes abuses carried out by numerous parties to the conflict, including Islamic terrorism organization <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/18650/">al-Shabaab</a>, the Somali <a href="http://www.cfr.org/somalia/somalias-transitional-government/p12475">Transitional Federal Government</a> (TFG) [CFR backgrounders], the <a href="http://amisom-au.org/">African Union peacekeeping forces</a> (AMISOM), and Somali militias supported by Kenya and Ethiopia. The fighting, which began to increase in late 2010, has resulted in over 4,000 civilian casualties and 1,000 deaths and has displaced thousands of Somalians. HRW Africa Director David Bekele called on the parties to end the abuses:<blockquote>Abuses by al-Shabaab and pro-government forces have vastly multiplied the suffering from Somalia's famine. All sides need to take urgent steps to stop these unlawful attacks, let in aid, and end this humanitarian nightmare. There is no quick fix to Somalia's tragedy, but it's clear that impunity for serious abuses perpetuates insecurity. International pressure to bring an end to abuses by all sides is more crucial than ever&#8212;a more secure and rights respecting Somalia would be less prone to violence and famine.</blockquote>The report also urged Kenya to protect Somalian refugees from public beheadings and floggings, inhumane social regulations and forced participation in combat enforced by Al-Shabaab, as well as police harassment, arbitrary arrest and deportation.

<p>Somalia has come under fire for its poor human rights record. In July, <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that Somali <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/children-somalia-facing-war-crimes-2011-07-20">children continue to be victims of war crimes</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/war-crimes-affecting-somalia-children-ai.php">report</a>].

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said that human rights violations committed during recent Somalian conflicts, including recruitment of child soldiers, <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/somalia-violence-may-constitute-war.php">may amount to war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. HRW <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/war-crimes-being-committed-in-somalia.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 that war crimes and other human rights violations are being committed in the ongoing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4760775.stm">Somali conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder].

The provision in state law allowing "any other chemical or chemicals" to be used for lethal injections <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Judge-Part-of-Ark-execution-law-unconstitutional-2016611.php">violates</a> [AP report] the constitution's protection against cruel and unusual punishment, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox said. The Arkansas <a href="http://adc.arkansas.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Department of Correction</a> [official website] relinquished its supply of sodium thiopental, a drug used in the lethal injection process, after coming under fire for obtaining the drug from <a href="http://www.dreampharma.com/">Dream Pharma</a> [corporate website], a British pharmaceutical company. The state was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=14131734">forced to purchase sodium thiopental overseas</a> [AP report] after the sole US manufacturer of the drug stopped production. Legal challenges followed, prompting Fox to rule that the corrections department must follow state law to obtain the drug. Attorney General Dustin McDaniel had <a href="http://www.fox16.com/news/local/story/Attorneys-file-response-in-Arkansas-execution-suit/jN3tIgr8KEm6snDGbE2Shg.cspx?rss=315">argued last week</a> [AP report] that the part of the lawsuit challenging the use of the drugs at issue was moot. Fox's decision is expected to be appealed to the Arkansas Supreme Court.

<p>The shortage of sodium thiopental in the US has caused several states to modify lethal injection protocol, which has led to a number of constitutional challenges by death row inmates. In March, two Texas inmates <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-30-RWexecutiondrug30_ST_N.htm">requested stays on their executions</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report] to obtain more information on the new protocol and possibly challenge the protocol as unconstitutional. Texas acknowledged that its supply of sodium thiopental had an expiration date of March 1. Arizona, Georgia and Oklahoma have faced similar challenges and are seeking to substitute the sodium thiopental used in the lethal injection "cocktail" with pentobarbital. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/us/02lethal.html">Kentucky and Tennessee surrendered supplies of sodium thiopental</a> [NYT report] to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) [official website] after the agency seized Georgia's supply in order to investigate whether the drug was properly imported. In September, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/27/10_99019_Morales_Brown_ord.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] a district court judge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-halts-california-execution.php">reconsider the stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] in the case of Albert Brown. The court noted that the timing of Brown's execution was influenced by the expiration of the state's supply of sodium thiopental, and stated that it was "incredible to think that the deliberative process might be driven by the expiration date of the execution drug."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Asmaa Mahfouz, 26, voiced her concern about Egypt's justice system and the military government's conduct in messages posted on the social media site. AI Director for Middle East and North Africa Malcolm Smart condemned Egyptian authorities for seeking to try Mahfouz in a military court:<blockquote>Asmaa Mahfouz is facing a military trial merely for posting comments which criticize the Egyptian military justice system and do not at all appear to represent a call to violence. The Egyptian authorities' decision to refer Asmaa Mahfouz to a military court seems intended to send a message to those critical of the authorities that dissent will not be tolerated. The charges against her must be dropped immediately.</blockquote>Mahfouz, who was released on bail shortly after being detained by prosecutors on Sunday, denies the allegations.

<p>Social media has had a significant impact in the recent revolutions in the Middle East and North Africa. AI <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report-2011-amnesty-international-50-says-historic-change-knife-edge-2011-05-13">reported</a> [text] in May that the pro-democracy protests have <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/social-media-creating-new-opportunities-for-rights-activists-ai-report.php">demonstrated the unique opportunities</a> [JURIST report] that social media has created for human rights activists. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that an Egyptian military court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-military-court-convicts-blogger-for-insulting-army.php">convicted blogger Maikel Nabil</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced him to three years in prison for criticizing the army and raising questions over reform in the wake of revolution in a blog post. Syrian Internet users reported in early February that social media sites Facebook and YouTube <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/syria-lifts-ban-on-social-media-sites-facebook-youtube.php">are accessible</a> [JURIST report] without proxy servers or VPNs. Syria appeared to be lifting the ban imposed in 2007 as a concession <a href="http://www.dp-news.com/en/detail.aspx?articleid=73460">to avoid popular upheaval</a> [DP report] in Syria. In late January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay acknowledged reports of tactics including <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">rubber-coated bullets, tear gas, water cannons and batons</a> [JURIST report] in Egypt, and called on the government to investigate the reports of excessive force including civilian deaths. Pillay also pressed the government to lift the emergency law that had been in force for nearly 30 years and restore the use of mobile phones and social networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2003, the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) had refused to certify the results of the exam that made disproportionately more white applicants than minority applicants eligible for promotion. Applicants who qualified for promotions based on their test scores but were denied promotions filed a lawsuit against the city claiming disparate impact. The appeal court's Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs held that Briscoe was not precluded from suing the city because he is not bound by the Supreme Court ruling in <span class="casename">Ricci v. DeStefano</span>, which ordered the CSB to certify the results of the test. Jacobs concluded that the lower court's reasoning for dismissing Briscoe's claim was "inconsistent with well-settled principles of nonparty preclusion." Briscoe claims that the weighting of the written and oral sections of the test was arbitrary and unrelated to the job requirements. Briscoe is seeking to enjoin the city from using the current weight ratio, as well as eligibility for promotion.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in 2009 <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1428.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/high-court-finds-title-vii-violation-in.php">report</a>] a lower court ruling dismissing racial discrimination challenges to the promotion criteria used by the New Haven fire department. The court ruled 5-4 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-1428">Ricci v. DeStefano</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that a "strong basis in evidence" that an employer would be liable under a <a href="http://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/2000e-16.htm">Title VII</a> [text] <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/factemployment_procedures.html">disparate impact</a> [EEOC backgrounder] analysis is necessary to justify a "race-based" action that would otherwise violate Title VII's disparate treatment standard. The court ruled that summary judgment on disparate treatment grounds in favor of firefighters who were not promoted despite high test scores was appropriate, finding that the <em>prima facie</em> disparate impact case demonstrated by the City did not meet the "strong basis in evidence" standard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A judge from the <a href="http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> [official website] issued a preliminary injunction for the plaintiffs&#8212;the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] and other rights groups&#8212;in June. Olens contends that the lower court erred in granting the injunction because the appellees are not likely to prevail on the merits and failed to show irreparable injury and because the harm to the public outweighs the appellees' interest in blocking the law. Olens also maintains that the appellees do not have standing to challenge the law. The legislation, which was scheduled to take effect on July 1, allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. The law also imposes fines and prison sentences of up to one year for anyone who knowingly transports illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the immigration status of potential employees, providing that workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment could face up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

<p>Many states have been embroiled in similar legal challenges to controversial immigration bills in recent months. Last week, the state of Arizona filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/AZ-petition-on-SB-2070.pdf">petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">report</a>] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] seeking to overturn a lower court decision enjoining four provisions of Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials]. Earlier this month, Alabama lawmakers filed a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/State%20of%20Alabama%20response%20to%20suits%20challenging%20its%20immigration%20law.pdf">response</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">report</a>] to groups seeking a preliminary injunction against the controversial Alabama <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">immigration law</a> [HB 56 text] that expands restrictions on undocumented immigrants. The ACLU filed a class action suit in May <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">challenging an Indiana immigration law</a> [JURIST report] that requires individuals to provide proof of their legal status at all times and calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only.

The "Law on the Right to Freedom of Conscience and Religion, and on Churches, Religions and Religious Community," passed by the Hungarian Parliament in a 254-43 vote on July 12, <a href="http://www.bosnewslife.com/17837-hungary-pressured-to-revoke-controversial-church-law">grants formal recognition</a> [BosNewsLife report] to only 14 of 358 religious organizations in Hungary. The law recognizes predominant religious denominations including Reformed, Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Orthodox, along with a few Jewish organizations. The excluded groups will automatically lose their registration status on January 1, 2012, thereby losing financial support and tax breaks from the government. <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=1">Freedom House</a> [advocacy website] sent an <a href="http://freedomhouse.org/images/File/Open%20letter_Hungary%20Religion%20law.pdf">open letter</a> [text, PDF] to the Human Rights Commissioners of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> and the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/default_en.asp">Council of Europe</a> [official websites] asking the international authorities to initiate action against Hungary, claiming the law violates Article 10 of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a> and Article 9 of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [texts]. Freedom House <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&release=1480">said the law is inconsistent with Hungary's constitution</a> [press release] and condemned Hungary for passing the law:<blockquote>This unabashed violation of freedom and equality of religions is paired with an open about-face from the separation of religious and political institutions that was achieved in our democratic transition twenty years ago. ... Never before has a Member State of the EU so blatantly dared to go against the principles of freedom of beliefs, equality before the law, and separation of church from state. These are all established fundamental rights in our common Europe.</blockquote>The churches have <a href="http://www.bbj.hu/politics/hungarian-churches-go-to-constitutional-court-over-new-church-law_59539">sent their letter</a> [BBJ report] to various government officials, including <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&id=28133">President Pal Schmitt</a> [EU profile] and <a href="http://www.miniszterelnok.hu/in_english_cv_of_viktor_orban/">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> [official profile].

<p>Several countries have recently enacted measures to both limit and expand religious freedom. A Russian court <a href="http://genproc.gov.ru/news/news-72454/">ruled</a> [statement text, in Russian] in July that the main texts of Scientology, including <em>What Is Scientology?</em>, are "calls to extremist activity" and placed them on the <a href="http://www.minjust.ru/ru/activity/nko/fedspisok/">Federal List of Extremist Materials</a> [text, in Russian], <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-court-bans-scientology-texts.php">effectively banning them in Russia</a> [JURIST report].

The bill, introduced by Representative Dave Agema (R), seeks to limit the enforcement and application of "foreign laws that would impair constitutional rights." Contractual provisions or agreements that provide for the choice of foreign law to govern disputes would be amended to ensure the constitutional rights of the parties are protected, and be considered void otherwise. Though the bill does not expressly mention Islamic <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8034/">Sharia law</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sharia+law">news archive</a>], Muslim advocates suggest that bill was introduced to ban the Islamic legal code. Dawud Walid, head of the Michigan branch of the <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [official website], said <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110815/NEWS06/110815052/Bill-aims-ban-sharia?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE">Michigan has been falsely accused</a> [<em>Detroit Free Press</em> report] of having a sharia-controlled government and condemned "fear mongering" about Sharia law.

<p>A similar Oklahoma law has recently been challenged in court. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and CAIR in May <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-urged-to-block-oklahoma-islamic-law-ban.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Awad_10th_Cir_Appellees_Br.pdf">uphold</a> [brief, PDF] a lower court ruling that blocked an Oklahoma constitutional amendment banning courts from considering international or Islamic law. Oklahoma voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">overwhelmingly approved the measure</a> [JURIST report], <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/questions/755.pdf?5,5">State Question 755</a> (SQ 755) [text, PDF], last November with 70 percent of the vote. The ACLU and CAIR filed suit on behalf of Oklahoma citizen Muneer Awad, who argued that the ban would invalidate part of his will, which is partially rooted in Islamic Sharia Law, and a judge for the <a href="http://www.okwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-oklahoma-amendment-banning-use-of-islamic-l.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report]. <a href="http://themaydan.org/bios.html">Haroon Moghul</a> [company profile], Executive Director of <a href="http://themaydan.org/index.html">The Maydan Institute</a> [official website], <a href="/hotline/2010/11/oklahoma-ban-of-sharia-deems-Islam-as-un-american.php">described the Oklahoma law as a "preemptive strike"</a> [JURIST comment] against American Muslims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%209372.pdf">Human Security Act</a> (HSA) [text, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/philippines-president-signs.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 by then-president Gloria Arroyo, authorizes the 72-hour detention of suspects without charge and allows for surveillance, wiretapping and seizure of assets. On the other hand, it says that officers who perform an unauthorized wiretap or violate the rights of a detainee could face up to 12 years in prison. The Aquino administration <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/08/16/general-as-philippines-anti-terror-law_8625338.html">proposed an amendment</a> [AP report] to reduce the $11,700-per-day fine imposed on police or military forces who wrongfully detain terror suspects, as well as removal of a provision requiring suspects to be alerted when they are placed under surveillance. The law has faced criticism for including a broad definition of terrorism and has purportedly been enforced on only two occasions.

<p>The <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a> [official website]  unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/philippines-high-court-upholds-anti-terror-law.php">upheld the constitutionality of HSA</a> [JURIST report] in October 2010, ruling the petitioners lacked legal standing to challenge the law because it had not caused them any actual damage. In its decision, the court noted that law enforcement officers' <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/philippines-police-reluctant-to-enforce.php">reluctance to enforce the law</a> [JURIST report] means it has had no real effect on the civil liberties of militant groups. Even before the controversial law <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/philippines-anti-terror-law-goes-into.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report], there was substantial opposition to the legislation. In March 2007, UN human rights expert Martin Scheinin <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-rights-official-urges-philippines-to.php">recommended that the act be amended or repealed</a> [JURIST report]. Also that year, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/philippines-bishops-urge-government-to.php">urged the government to revisit the act</a> [JURIST report], saying that "many voices are apprehensive" about the anti-terror legislation. In response to criticism, Filipino presidential spokesperson Ignacio Bunye said that the law had <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/philippines-government-to-proceed-with.php">already undergone "exhaustive debates" in the legislature</a> [JURIST report]. The government also announced plans for a "massive public information and advocacy campaign" to accompany implementation and highlight "the existence of terror cells in the region and throughout the world."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU contends that the law infringes on the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a> [text] rights of individuals convicted of certain offenses, and is overly broad and vague in violation of First and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text]. The law bars offenders from "using or accessing" social networking sites, chat rooms and peer-to-peer networks. The ACLU maintains that the definitions of the restricted sites could be construed as including Reuters, usajobs.gov, and amazon.com, among many others. The ACLU further argues that the plaintiff on whose behalf the complaint was filed has "worked hard to reenter society" and that "his efforts to remain a productive, contributing member of society will be severely hampered" by the new law. Louisiana <a href="http://www.gov.state.la.us/">Governor Bobby Jindal</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom&tmp=detail&articleID=2972">said he would fight the lawsuit</a> [press release]:<blockquote>We will not comply with this request to allow convicted sex predators to use social networking sites. I will fight this with everything I have. If these people want to search the Internet for new victims they can do it somewhere else. This lawsuit is a disturbing break from reality, even for the ACLU. As Governor and the father of three young kids, I will fight the ACLU every step of the way and do everything I can to keep our kids safe from the monsters who want to harm them.</blockquote>ACLU of Louisiana Executive Director Marjorie Esman <a href="https://laaclu.org/newsArchive.php?id=421#n421">said that the law lacks procedural mechanisms</a> [press release] for obtaining permission to use the restricted sites, and that "reasonable restrictions to prevent future crimes are appropriate in the interest of public safety." The legislation took effect on August 15. 

<p>US courts have seen numerous constitutional challenges to laws placing restrictions on sex offenders. In May 2010, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1224.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">report</a>] 7-2 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1224">United States v. Comstock</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that mentally ill sex offenders may be civilly committed beyond their prison sentences. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/new-jersey-high-court-bars-sex-offender.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 that local ordinances prohibiting convicted sex offenders from living near schools, playgrounds, and other public areas were preempted by the state's <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/appdiv/megan.htm">Megan's Law</a> [text] and, therefore, invalid. Courts have invalidated similar laws in <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/indiana-appeals-court-partially.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/georgia-high-court-throws-out-sex.php">Georgia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/federal-judge-bars-retroactive.php">California</a> [JURIST reports].

HTC also expressed a willingness to settle. The investigation is expected to last 15 to 18 months and could delay the rival companies' pending civil suits. The last patent infringement battle <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">ended in defeat for HTC</a> [JURIST report]. No appeal has been filed yet in that case.

<p>Apple has been battling a number of lawsuits recently. Last week, a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-major-publishers-of-collusion.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] alleged that Apple and five major publishers colluded to illegally fix electronic book (e-book) prices. Apple <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-samsung.php">filed a complaint against Samsung</a> [JURIST report] last month in an effort to bar importation of Samsung's smartphones and tablets. Apple claimed Samsung's "Galaxy" line copies its iPhone and iPad technology. The complaint came just a week after <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/samsung-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-apple.php">Samsung filed a similar complaint</a> [JURIST report] seeking to prevent Apple from importing iPads and iPhones. Samsung claimed that Apple violated five patents also related to smartphones and tablets. In addition, Samsung <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-30/samsung-sues-apple-in-london-following-u-s-iphone-ipad-patent-lawsuit.html">filed a patent infringement suit</a> [Bloomberg report] against Apple in the High Court in London in June. Finnish telecommunications company <a href="http://www.nokia.com/home">Nokia</a> [corporate website] announced in June that it had <a href="http://press.nokia.com/2011/06/14/nokia-enters-into-patent-license-agreement-with-apple/">entered into an agreement</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/apple-to-pay-nokia-royalties-in-settlement-of-patent-disputes.php">report</a>] with Apple, settling all patent disputes between the parties and directing Apple to pay royalties to Nokia for the term of the agreement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, filed against the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], seeks an injunction against the new regulations, which the companies claim unconstitutionally force them to disseminate the government's anti-smoking message. Floyd Abrams, an attorney for <a href="http://www.lorillard.com/?id=1">Lorillard</a> [corporate website], <a href="http://investors.lorillard.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=134955&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1597256&highlight=">said</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The regulations violate the First Amendment. ... The notion that the government can require those who manufacture a lawful product to emblazon half of its package with pictures and words admittedly drafted to persuade the public not to purchase that product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. The government can engage in as much anti-smoking advocacy as it chooses in whatever language and with whatever pictures it chooses; it cannot force those who lawfully sell tobacco to the public to carry that message, those words, and those pictures.</blockquote>The other plaintiffs are <a href="http://www.rjrt.com/">RJ Reynolds</a>, <a href="http://www.commonwealthbrands.com/age_verification.aspx?redirect=http%3a%2f%2fwww.commonwealthbrands.com%2fDefault.aspx">Commonwealth Brands</a> and <a href="http://www.liggettvectorbrands.com/">Liggett Group</a> [corporate websites]. The new labeling rules are set to take effect in September 2012.

<p>In February, Lorillard and RJ Reynolds <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tobacco-companies-file-lawsuit-against-fda-advisory-panel.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging an FDA advisory opinion on the use of menthol in cigarettes.

A federal judge <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-upholds-restrictions-on.php">upheld the majority of the restrictions</a>, and an <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-on-tobacco-advertising.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports] is underway.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Several reasons were given for the motion, including the late capture of Mladic as well as efficiency in convicting him. Reports stated that Mladic's health was also an issue, and the tribunal hoped to successfully prosecute him for the Srebrenica massacre before he dies. The ICTY also announced on Wednesday that <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Radovan+Karadzic">Radovan Kardzic</a> [JURIST news archive] would begin the portion of his trial for the Srebrenica massacre in January and that an initial appearance for Goran Hadzic has not been scheduled.

<p>Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. At his <A href = "/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">second appearance</a> [JURIST report] he refused to enter a plea. Before that, he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports]. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for allegedly ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the massacre of Srebrenica during the Bosnian civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law prohibits comprehensive insurance plans from covering any abortion other than to save a woman's life but allows companies to offer a separate rider to cover abortions for an additional cost. The law will also ban coverage for abortion except in very limited instances in policies sold after 2014 under the new federal health care law. According to the ACLU complaint, the legislation violates the constitution:<blockquote>The Act's only purpose is to make it more difficult for women to obtain and pay for abortion care. Indeed, it is akin to imposing an additional tax on the procedure. Moreover, because the Act serves no legitimate state interest, it fails even rational basis review. And, by prohibiting women from purchasing insurance that covers all of their health care needs while placing no similar restriction on men, it impermissibly discriminates based on sex.</blockquote>Kansas is <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/08/16/3081097/aclu-sues-kansas-over-limits-on.html">one of several states</a> [<em>Kansas City Star</em> report] to enact similar legislation over the past two years. The measure took effect July 1.

<p>Kansas has also recently imposed several other abortion restrictions. Last week, the state <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/kansas-appeals-order-to-block-law-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">filed an appeal</a> seeking to overturn a federal judge's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-law-defunding-of-planned-parenthood.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] that blocks a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/hb2014/">law</a> [HB 2014 materials] preventing <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/kansas-mid-missouri/">Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri</a> (PPKM) [advocacy website] from receiving federal funding. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-abortion-law-requiring-licenses-for-clinics.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to block a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/sb36/">regulation</a> [SB 36 materials] requiring clinics within the state to obtain a license to perform abortions. In April, Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">signed two pieces of legislation</a> [JURIST report] restricting abortions in the state. The <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF] requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed, and the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">"fetal pain bill"</a> [HB 2218, PDF] restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/ukraine-ex-prime-minister-charged-with-abuse-of-office.php">alleges</a> [JURIST report] that Tymoshenko orchestrated a deal where Ukraine's national gas company would pay Russia excessively high prices for gas. Although Yushchenko and Tymoshenko were allies in Ukraine's Orange Revolution, Yushchenko testified that these charges are true, and that Tymoshenko made a number of unnecessary political moves against his wishes to negotiate higher prices for Russia. Yushchenko also <a href = "http://en.rian.ru/world/20110817/165853783.html">called on the prosecution</a> [RIA Novosti] to question Russian <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] and the CEO of Russian energy company <a href = "http://www.gazprom.com/">Gazprom</a> [corporate website]. Tymoshenko <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/s77cx38s">refused to cross-examine</a> [press release] Yushchenko so the Orange Revolution would not be tarnished. However, afterward, her counsel stated that Yushchenko had <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/57ozxmnx">lied under oath</a> [press release], specifically alleging that his testimony directly contradicted another prosecution witness' testimony.

<p>Last week, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this month, Ukrainian Judge Rodion Kireyev <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. Kireyev <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/8csvmm6e">again refused to recuse himself</a> the week before, and Tymoshenko announced that she was allowed to call only <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/soscx239">two of her proposed witnesses</a> [press releases]. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian]. ECHR President Jean Paul Costa <a href="http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/1235011-v-espch-ne-kommentiruyut-perspektivu-iskov-timoshenko-k-ukraine">refused to comment on the complaint</a> [<em>Korrespondent</em> report, in Russian], but said the matter was before the court. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In postponing the hearing, the judges wrote, "that disclosure related issues raised just prior to the confirmation have rendered it impossible to fairly conduct the confirmation hearing on the scheduled date."

<p>Mbarushimana <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/drc-war-crimes-suspect-denies-allegations-at-initial-icc-appearance.php">made his initial appearance</a> [JURIST report] before the ICC in January and denied the charges against him. The court provided official notice of the charges against Mbarushimana, which include five counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes including murder, rape, torture, and attacks against the civilian population, and also informed him of his rights under the Rome Statute. In addition to facing allegations relating to violence in the DRC, Mbarushimana has also been linked to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. In December, a French judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/france-judge-charges-rwanda-rebel-leader-with-war-crimes-report.php">charged Mbarushimana</a> [JURIST report] with war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the genocide. In 2008, Mbarushimana was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/rwanda-war-crimes-suspect-arrested-in.php">arrested by German border police</a> [JURIST report] as he attempted to travel to Russia on charges that he killed 32 people during the Rwandan genocide.

The pre-trial judge issued a <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/PreTrialChamber/20110816_F0012_PUBLIC_PRV_PTJ_Confirmation_Decision_Filed_FR-EN.pdf">decision confirming the indictment</a>, as well as an <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/PreTrialChamber/20110816_F0032_PUBLIC_PTJ_Ordonnance_Filed_FR.pdf">order lifting confidentiality</a> [texts, PDF].

STL prosecutor Daniel Bellemare <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/sid/294">welcomed the order</a> [press release] to unseal the indictment:<blockquote>This Order will finally inform the public and the victims about the facts alleged in the indictment regarding the commission of the crime that led to charging the four accused. This unsealing of the indictment answers many questions about the 14 February 2005 attack. The full story will however only unfold in the courtroom, where an open, public, fair and transparent trial will render a final verdict.</blockquote>Lebanese authorities reported to the tribunal last week that they have <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-says-authorities-have-reported-back-on-hariri-probe.php">not detained the suspects</a> [JURIST report]. A <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/17/hariri-indictment-phones-hezbollah-lebanon">trial <em>in absentia</em> is likely</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] if the suspects are not apprehended.

<p>On Thursday, the STL president made a public plea for the four men to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-urges-suspects-to-turn-themselves-in.php">turn themselves in</a> [JURIST report]. Judge Antonio Cassese guaranteed a fair trial and adequate representation and pressed Lebanese citizens to allow the STL to hold the assassins accountable. In February, the appeals chamber of the STL issued a unanimous <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/News/Summary%20of%20Decision_16%20February%20%28EN%29.pdf">ruling</a> [summary, PDF] on several procedural issues, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-defines-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">including the definition of terrorism</a> [JURIST report], in judicial proceedings. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine which laws to apply in the case against persons accused of involvement in the February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. Using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Article 314 of the Lebanese Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF], the court held that a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger," that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case. The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sen is charged with misappropriation of funds and misrepresentation of facts. The motions for impeachment were submitted after an official inquiry ended with Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy finding Sen guilty of the charges. Chief Justice of India, KG Balakrishnan also recommended in a <a href = "http://www.hindu.com/nic/chief%20justice%20letter%20to%20pm.html">letter</a> [text] to <a href = "http://pmindia.nic.in/">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] that Sen be removed. Sen <a href = "http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2365617.ece?homepage=true">blamed the impeachment on Balakrishnan</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report] in his two-hour defense before the Council. Sen argued that the allegations are a conspiracy to have him removed to increase the image of the judiciary. Sen, in his capacity as justice, was assigned to sell an inventory of rejected goods from two civil suits, with the proceeds going back toward the payment of the judgment in one case, and disbursed to workers as back payments in another. Sen was to keep five percent for himself and had absolute control over all bank accounts connected to the cases. Parties to the cases requested information from Sen after not receiving their funds, which he ignored. Eventually, Sen withdrew all the money from the accounts and closed them, without explanation to the courts. Sen, in his defense, stated he had released funds to the workers, but did not account for the other case's missing money. If two-thirds of the Council of States find him guilty, Sen's case will be sent to the <a href = "http://loksabha.nic.in/">House of the People</a> [official website], India's lower house, for identical proceedings. It is uncertain when Council members will vote.

<p>If impeached, Sen will be the first sitting high judge to be removed from office in Indian history, and it is only the second impeachment proceeding ever attempted. <a href="http://presidentofindia.nic.in/profile.html">President Smt. Pratibha Devisingh Patil</a> [official website] announced in February that the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/india-president-government-to-address-corruption.php">government will work to eradicate corruption</a> [JURIST report]. The government recently created a group of ministers charged with <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Corruption-and-inflation-top-govt-priorities--says-President/752950">streamlining the judicial system</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report], particularly working to expedite corruption cases brought against civil servants suspected of corruption and to amend current laws to facilitate bringing claims against public servants. Singh called for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/india-pm-backs-special-courts-for.php">establishment of special courts</a> [JURIST report] to deal only with corruption charges, telling a convention of high-ranking justices and government ministers that, "apart from pendency and delayed justice, corruption is another challenge we face both in government and the judiciary." Singh said addressing these problems would increases both domestic and foreign confidence in the court system. India's judiciary was analyzed in the FORUM post <a href = "/forum/2011/03/india-and-pakistan-a-tale-of-judicial-appointments-dnp.php">India and Pakistan: A Tale of Judicial Appointments</a> [JURIST op-ed] by guest columnist <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu.sg/faculty/law/shubhankard.asp">Shubhankar Dam</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://www.law.smu.edu.sg/index.asp">Singapore Management University School of Law</a> [official website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The class is composed of individuals who purchased an iPhone prior to May 1, and each plaintiff is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixDsaBrJDj6HJqiWvqf1BNC589dw?docId=CNG.3404e18b09e683dd9aaf2d6e60f080df.5e1">seeking 1 million won (USD $933) in damages</a> [AFP report].  One of the lawyers handling the case, Kim Hyung-Suk, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/14/kim-hyung-suk-south-korea-iphone-apple-location-tracking_n_898050.html">filed suit on his own</a> [Reuters report] regarding the privacy breach and was awarded one million won in June. The class action suit alleges that Apple's privacy breach violated article 10 and article 17 of the <a href="http://korea.assembly.go.kr/res/low_02_read.jsp?boardid=1000000036">Constitution of the Republic of Korea</a> [text] and that the individual plaintiffs suffered emotional damages as a result. Kim anticipates that another suit will be filed in the near future with a smaller class of around 900 affected individuals.

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-korea-regulator-fines-apple-for-collection-of-iphone-user-location-information.php">South Korean regulators fined Apple</a> [JURIST report] USD $2,855 for collecting location information from its iPhone and iPad users. It marked the first time Apple was punished for collecting location information from users of its widely popular mobile computing products. The country has also been investigating Google over illegal data collection. In January, the <a href="http://www.police.go.kr/">South Korea National Police Agency</a> [official website, in Korean] announced it had found evidence that Google <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/south-korea-police-announce-google-violated-privacy-laws-by-collecting-private-data.php">illegally collected private data</a> [JURIST report] in the process of producing its popular <a href="http://maps.google.com/intl/en_ca/help/maps/streetview/">Street View</a> [website] mapping service. The illegally captured data included hundreds of thousands of emails, instant messages, passwords and search histories through unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. The information was discovered on 79 hard disks seized from Google's Seoul office, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/south-korea-police-raid-google-office-over-data-collection.php">police raided</a> [JURIST report] last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Originally, the president could kill the legislation by ignoring it for 30 days. The constitutional reform now requires the president to take action on a bill within 30 days of receipt. Otherwise, the bill will automatically become law. Calderon stated that the change <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/2011/08/el-presidente-calderon-en-la-firma-del-decreto-que-reforma-los-articulos-71-72-y-78-de-la-constitucion-politica/">reiterates his commitment</a> [statement, in Spanish] to strengthening Mexico's democratic system.

<p><iframe width="420" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GOe96HJSz3E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Calderon's administration has been plagued with accusations of corruption and rights violations. Last week, Mexico's <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/">National Human Rights Commission</a> [official website, in Spanish] released a report contending that military and law enforcement officials conduct illegal searches and engage in a "systematic pattern" of <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mexico-human-rights-body-alleges-regular-police-misconduct.php">coercive, threatening and abusive behavior</a> [JURIST report] in their efforts to combat the country's narcotics trade. Following the April <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mexico-attorney-general-resigns-amid-criticism.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report] of former Mexican attorney general Arturo Chavez, the <a href="http://www.pgr.gob.mx/ingles/que%20es%20pgr/presentation.asp">Attorney General's Office</a> (PGR) [official website] last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mexico-ag-purges-office-charges-111-officials-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] 111 officials who served under Chavez with various corruption-related offenses, including falsifying documents, interfering with the administration of justice, abuse of power, perjury and bribery. Additionally, 140 police officers were fired and it was disclosed that 280 more are under investigation. Mexico has struggled to combat the drug cartels' influence on the government and the country as a whole. There have been <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20101215-mexico-and-cartel-wars-2010?utm_source=SWeekly&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=101216&utm_content=readmore&elq=b1b5d866b6a74b31a7b5ad7de5742eaf">more than 27,000 drug-related deaths</a> [STRATFOR report] since 2006, and the violence has steadily escalated over the past few years. In April 2009, Mexico's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/mexico-senate-approves-pre-conviction.php">passed a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] permitting the seizure of suspected drug traffickers' property prior to their conviction. In 2008, a former assistant attorney general was arrested for receiving bribes, and Mexico's prosecutor's office <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/mexico-prosecutors-office-admits.php">admitted that it had been infiltrated</a> [JURIST reports] by the drug cartels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group reported that Judge Lynn Smith was very respectful of the questions they raised but dismissed the suit due to the organization's commitment to keeping their members anonymous. However, Smith suggested the Farewell Foundation intervene in a <a href = "http://www.bccla.org/pressreleases/11Medically_assisted_dying.html">similar suit</a> [press release] by the <a href = "http://www.bccla.org/">British Columbia Civil Liberties Association</a> (BCCLA) [advocacy website], which the group is planning to do, partially because the BCCLA's suit is fighting for physician-assisted suicide, while the Farewell Foundation seeks something closer to the "Swiss model" that allows people to take their own lives without physician assistance. Both groups are challenging the constitutionality of <a href = "http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-103.html#h-79">section 241(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada</a> [text], which criminalizes assisted suicide. The groups argue that this is contrary to sections 7 and 15 of the <a href = "http://lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/charter/page-1.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], which guarantee the rights to liberty and equal protection, respectively. The BCCLA's suit is slated to begin arguments on November 15.

<p>The right to die has been a highly contentious issue around the world. Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/india-high-court-rules-passive-euthanasia-permitted-under-certain-circumstances.php">rejected a petition for mercy killing</a> [JURIST report] but ruled that passive euthanasia was permissible under certain circumstances. The German <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/cln_136/DE/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website, in German] ruled in October that <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php">removing a patient from life support is not a criminal offense</a> [JURIST report] if the terminal individual had previously given consent. The year before, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.wa.gov.au/">Supreme Court of Western Australia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/australia-court-allows-quadriplegic.php">upheld the right to die</a> [JURIST report] in a case involving a quadriplegic who asked to be removed from food and hydration services. In July 2009, the UK Law Lords asked the Director of Public Prosecutions to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/uk-law-lords-order-clarification-of.php">clarify</a> [JURIST report] the UK's laws regarding those who aid patients seeking assisted suicide. Many Britons have reportedly gone to the <a href="http://www.dignitas.ch/">Dignitas clinic</a> [website, in German] in Switzerland to obtain assisted suicides. The House of Lords also that month <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/uk-house-of-lords-rejects-assisted.php">rejected a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would would have barred prosecuting those who go abroad to help others commit assisted suicide. In May 2009, the <a href="http://www.scourt.go.kr/main/Main.work">South Korean Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Korean] upheld a lower court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/south-korea-high-court-upholds-right-to.php">allowing a brain-damaged patient the right to die</a>. The judge held that, for future cases, doctors should make efforts to confirm patients' wishes to die with dignity and that such determinations can be deduced from an analysis of different factors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 22-page report, prepared by the the Fact-finding Mission on Syria, contains allegations of summary executions, killing of unarmed protesters and torture of detainees. According to the report, "[t]he Mission found a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population, which may amount to crimes against humanity as provided for in article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court." The Fact-finding Mission recommended that the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] for further investigation. UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] is set to address the Security Council later Thursday, and the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) [official website] will <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11314&LangID=E">hold a special session on Syria</a> [press release] on Monday.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">Fact-finding Mission was established</a> [JURIST report] by the HRC in April. Last week, 27 rights groups called for the HRC to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-body-urged-to-condemn-syria-violence.php">convene a second special session on Syria</a> [JURIST report]. Also last week, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that an unknown Western country is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Syria's recent human rights abuses. Last month, two UN rights officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">expressed concern over reports of violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people. Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide Francis Deng and Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect Edward Luck said that reports of Syrian forces killing or arbitrarily arresting peaceful protesters indicate potentially grievous violations of international human rights laws, and urged officials to adhere to the government's 2005 pledge to protect its citizens. In June, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">published a preliminary report</a> [JURIST report] describing human rights violations in Syria and calling for an investigation into government-authorized abuses related to pro-democracy protests that began earlier this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICTY appeals chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icty-appeals-chamber-reverses-acquittal-of-former-kosovo-pm.php">overturned the acquittals</a> [JURIST report] of Haradinaj, Idriz Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj in July 2010. The appeals chamber found that the integrity of the original proceedings was compromised due to the trial chamber's "[failure] to take sufficient steps to counter the witness intimidation that permeated the trial." After the acquittals, many Serbians believed that the ICTY was unfairly prosecuting Serbians and letting ethnic Albanians free. In preparation for the trial, witness and former KLA member Shefqet Kabashi was transferred to the ICTY to stand trial for <a href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/10774">contempt of court</a> [press release] after refusing to answer questions during the initial proceeding. The ICTY says his testimony is critical to proving six counts of the indictment. 

<p>In May 2008, ICTY Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/icty-prosecutor-appeals-war-crimes.php">filed an appeal against the acquittals</a> [JURIST report]. Brammertz asked that the case be retried before a different chamber of the tribunal, arguing that prosecution was not allowed the to present enough witnesses. Haradinaj was charged with <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/icty-trial-begins-for-former-kosovo.php">37 counts of war crimes</a>, including murder, persecution and rape, but the ICTY acquitted him of all charges in April 2008, citing a lack of evidence. Haradinaj was a senior commander in the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kla.htm">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force that opposed <a href="/currentawareness/milosevic.php">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive] during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 Kosovo war</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kosovo+war">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, filed in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], claims that the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) and US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [advocacy website] are violating the detainees' constitutional rights by requiring that all detainees be shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles for court appearances, rather than making an individual case-by-case determination. According to the complaint:<blockquote>Defendants' policy and practice of shackling all detained immigrants for immigration court proceedings causes detainees to suffer physical and emotional pain, is dehumanizing, and undermines the dignity of court proceedings. It also hinders detainees' ability to communicate with their attorneys. ... Freedom from physical restraint has always been recognized as a fundamental constitutional right, requiring due process before it can be infringed.</blockquote>The suit was filed by four individuals on behalf of a class of people who are or will be detained for their immigration proceedings in San Francisco. The ACLU-NC expects the case to have national implications.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in 2005 that it is <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/supreme-court-rules-against-shackling.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] to force capital murder defendants to appear before juries in shackles. The majority said that viewing a prisoner in shackles would be too damaging to the jury's perception of the defendant. ICE and DHS have previously faced criticism for their treatment of immigration detainees. In March, the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website] reported that US immigration enforcement agencies are <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-criticizes-us-immigrant-detention-system.php">overly reliant on a flawed detention system</a> [JURIST report]. The report expresses concern over increased use of detention by the US government, citing a doubling in detention of non-citizens by ICE. It criticized the US government for viewing detention as a necessity and not as an exception in its enforcement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sen was charged with misappropriation of funds and misrepresentation of facts. Sen, in his capacity as justice, was assigned to sell an inventory of rejected goods from two civil suits, with the proceeds going back toward the payment of the judgment in one case, and disbursed to workers as back payments in another. Sen was to keep five percent for himself and had absolute control over all bank accounts connected to the cases. Parties to the cases requested information from Sen after not receiving their funds, which he ignored.

The three-judge panel voted 2-1 to uphold the judgment and all three judges rejected Philip Morris' reasoning.<blockquote>Philip Morris knew that the consensus among scientific and medical professionals was that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer and other serious diseases, that its cigarettes contained many carcinogens, and that smokers suffered lung cancer and other serious diseases at rates far greater than nonsmokers. Despite that knowledge, Philip Morris and other cigarette manufacturers for many years conducted a public campaign designed to obscure and deny the truth. Philip Morris falsely asserted that there was no consensus in the scientific and medical community concerning the adverse health effects of smoking and that the relationship between smoking and health was unknown. Philip Morris assured its customers that if it learned that any cigarette ingredient caused cancer it would remove that ingredient, and falsely stated that it did not believe that smoking was hazardous. Philip Morris repeatedly asserted that more research was needed and that it was diligently pursuing that research, but avoided sponsoring any research that would reveal the hazards of smoking and went to great lengths to avoid disclosing its own toxicological data. Rather than remove nicotine from its cigarettes as it had the ability to do, Philip Morris added urea to its cigarettes to enhance the effect of nicotine so as to further exploit its customers' addiction and gain new customers. Its customers included individuals such as Bullock who first began to smoke as youths before July 1, 1969, attracted in part by an aggressive advertising campaign in television, print and other media that was particularly appealing to youths.</blockquote>The dissent argued that the US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] case <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/01-1289.ZS.html">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell</a> [text] limited the punitive damages ruling to nine times compensation of the other damages. The dissenting judge would have upheld a $7.65 million punitive judgment. Philip Morris plans to appeal to the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website].

<p>In May, the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/california-supreme-court-permits-tobacco-suits-for-subsequent-medical-conditions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously to allow claims against tobacco companies for smoking-related ailments that arise after the statute of limitations for an earlier condition has elapsed. Though state law requires that parties file suit within two years of discovering an injury, the decision will allow smokers to proceed with claims based on medical conditions originating after a previous diagnosis so long as the injuries are "separate and distinct." In December, Philip Morris and <a href="http://www.rjrt.com/">RJ Reynolds</a> [corporate website], along with an industry trade group, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-tobacco-companies-appeal-270-million-settlement-to-supreme-court.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court to overturn a $271.5 million class action settlement for having "distort[ed] the entire body of public knowledge about the addictive effects of nicotine." The settlement was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10851376620769925503">awarded</a> [opinion, text] by the <a href="http://www.la4th.org/">Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] in order to establish a fund meant to help Louisianans quit smoking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new guidelines direct the <a href = "http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] to target for deportation those "who have been convicted of crimes or pose a security risk," and "clear out low-priority cases." The priority of a case will be determined by prosecutorial discretion granted in a number of areas: "the person's length of presence in the United States, with particular consideration given to presence while in lawful status;" "the circumstances of the person's arrival in the United States and the manner of his or her entry,particularly if the alien came to the United States as a young child;" "the person's pursuit of education in the United States;" "whether the person, or the person's immediate relative, has served in the U.S. military;" "the person's ties and contributions to the community, including family relationships;" "whether the person is the primary caretaker of a person with a mental or physical disability, minor, or seriously ill relative;" and several other factors. Many of the criteria mirror portions of the <A href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.1751:">Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act</a> [House bill; Senate <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S3992:">bill</a>], a bill that has a languished in Congress for a decade which attempts to provide amnesty for illegal immigrants who serve in the military or achieve a college education. During Obama's three years in office, approximately one million illegal immigrants have been deported, with almost <a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/22/deportations-obama-immigration_n_906676.html">400,000</a> [AP report] last year alone.

<p>Reactions to the new policy have poured in from around the nation. <a href = "http://durbin.senate.gov/public/">Senator Dick Durbin</a> (D-IL) [official website], a major sponsor of the DREAM Act, <a href = "http://durbin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=46e027e8-fe46-4b62-93e2-7b4c4ea48d2b">praised the decision</a> [press release]: "The Obama Administration has made the right decision in changing the way they handle deportations of DREAM Act students. These students are the future doctors, lawyers, teachers and, maybe, Senators, who will make America stronger." However, Arizona <a href = http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] called the announcement <a href = "http://www.azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_081711_Deportations.pdf">backdoor amnesty</a> [press release, PDF]. Rights groups have also been critical of the decision, stating it does not go far enough. The <a href = "http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], in an emailed press release, criticized the focus on criminals for deportation: "The administration says it will focus on individuals with crimes, but many of those individuals came to the United States at a young age, have spouses and children who are U.S. citizens, and pose no danger to our country." <a href = "http://reformimmigrationforamerica.org/">Reform Immigration for America</a> [advocacy website] also said the <a href = "http://reformimmigrationforamerica.org/blog/blog/breaking-dhs-announces-changes-to-deportation-proceedings/">new policies don't go far enough</a> [press release]. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.aclunc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California</a> (ACLU-NC) and the <a href="http://www.lawyerscommittee.org/">Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights</a> [advocacy website] filed <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/rights-groups-challenge-practice-of-shackling-immigration-detainees.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the practice of shackling immigration detainees in court.<br />

Pillay's remarks came after the Fact-finding Mission in Syria published its 22-page report concluding that Syrian government forces cracking down on the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay said, however, that she is <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/08/2011818215749363523.html">not optimistic</a> [Al Jazeera report] that the Security Council will act. Also Thursday, a coalition of 50 human rights groups led by <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/site/c.bdKKISNqEmG/b.1277549/k.D7FE/UN_Watch__Monitoring_the_UN_Promoting_Human_Rights.htm">UN Watch</a> [advocacy website] sent an <a href="http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2011/08/18/50-rights-groups-urge-uns-syria-meeting-to-mandate-victim-hearings-special-investigator/">open letter</a> [text] to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) [official website] urging them to mandate a permanent special investigator on Syria and to hold televised hearings in Geneva for victims to testify:<blockquote>We therefore call on the council now to use all measures at its disposal to end the bloodshed. Inter alia, we recommend that the Special Session do the following:
<ol>
	<li>The council should strongly condemn Syria for its gross and systematic violations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the right to life.</li></li>
	<li>Given the inability of the High Commissioner&#8217;s fact-finding mission to enter Syria, the council should request the mission to conduct public hearings at the United Nations office in Geneva, featuring live, televised testimony by victims of the Syrian massacres, some of whom have escaped to neighboring countries. ...</li></li>
	<li>The Council should end the protection gap by appointing a Special Rapporteur on the grave situation of human rights in Syria. ... </li>
	<li>The council should take action to hold the Syrian military and political leadership personally accountable for crimes against humanity.</li>
</ol></blockquote>The HRC is set to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11314&LangID=E">hold a special session on Syria</a> [press release] on Monday.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">Fact-finding Mission was established</a> [JURIST report] by the HRC in April but was not permitted to enter the country. Last week, 27 rights groups called for the HRC to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-body-urged-to-condemn-syria-violence.php">convene a second special session on Syria</a> [JURIST report]. Also last week, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that an unknown Western country is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Syria's recent human rights abuses. Last month, two UN rights officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">expressed concern over reports of violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people. Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide Francis Deng and Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect Edward Luck said that reports of Syrian forces killing or arbitrarily arresting peaceful protesters indicate potentially grievous violations of international human rights laws, and urged officials to adhere to the government's 2005 pledge to protect its citizens. In June, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">published a preliminary report</a> [JURIST report] describing human rights violations in Syria and calling for an investigation into government-authorized abuses related to pro-democracy protests that began earlier this year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Most of Gbagbo's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/ivory-coast-presidents-son-12-others-charged-with-post-election-violence.php">remaining supporters were arrested</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Although Gbagbo's supporters have been actively sought for arrest, many believe troops loyal to Ivory Coast <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; <a href="http://lafrique.com/">political website</a>, in French] are similarly culpable. Although Ouattara has insisted that all <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-president-says-all-responsible-for-post-election-violence-will-be-prosecuted-.php">those responsible for war crimes will be prosecuted</a> [JURIST report], none of his supporters has been charged or arrested. However, reports have alleged that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-reports-violence-continues-in-ivory-coast.php">violence is still being committed by Ouattara supporters</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, a representative for the <a href = "http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/minuci/">UN Mission in the Ivory Coast</a> (MINUCI) [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/un-reports-ivory-coast-presidents-forces-continuing-extrajudicial-killings.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] that forces loyal to Ouattara are continuing to kill civilians and opposition members in his name, with 26 killings reported between July 11 and August 10. 

<p>Last month, Ouattara <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-sets-up-commission-to-investigate-post-election-violence.php">set up a commission of inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to investigate crimes and human rights violations that took place during the violence following the presidential elections in which former president Gbagbo refused to leave office after losing the election. In April, Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured and forced from office</a> [JURIST report] after refusing to leave despite losing last November's election to Ouattara, which resulted in months of fighting between Ouattara's and Gbagbo's forces. Also that month, <A href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the FRCI killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. The <a href = "http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] also reported the deaths of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The STL has established jurisdiction over the June 2005 assassination of anti-Syria politician <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/PreTrialChamber/20110819_F0005_PUBLIC_PTJ_Ordonnance-Dessaisissement_Hawi_Filed_FR.pdf">George Hawi</a>, the July 2005 attempted assassination of Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/PreTrialChamber/20110819_F0006_PUBLIC_PTJ_Ordonnance_Dessaisissement_El-Murr_Filed_FR.pdf">Elias Murr</a> and the October 2004 attempted assassination of lawmaker <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/CaseFiles/PreTrialChamber/20110819_F0004_PUBLIC_PTJ_Ordonnance_Dessaisissement_Hamadeh_Filed_FR.pdf">Marwan Hamadeh</a> [orders, PDF] in October 2004. The rulings do not mean that an indictment will necessarily be issued, but they allow the prosecutor to continue investigating. The STL did not offer any details on how the attacks may be connected.

<p>On Wednesday, the STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-unseals-indictment-in-hariri-case.php">unsealed the indictment</a> [JURIST report] against four alleged <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder] members accused of assassinating Hariri. Last week, the STL president made a public plea for the four men to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-urges-suspects-to-turn-themselves-in.php">turn themselves in</a> [JURIST report]. Judge Antonio Cassese guaranteed a fair trial and adequate representation and pressed Lebanese citizens to allow the STL to hold the assassins accountable. In February, the appeals chamber of the STL issued a unanimous <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/News/Summary%20of%20Decision_16%20February%20%28EN%29.pdf">ruling</a> [summary, PDF] on several procedural issues, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-defines-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">including the definition of terrorism</a> [JURIST report], in judicial proceedings. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine which laws to apply in the case against persons accused of involvement in the February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. Using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Article 314 of the Lebanese Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF], the court held that a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger," that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case. The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Refusal could result in a $220 AUD fine with the worst potential penalties at a year in jail and a fine of $5500. The proposed law will amend the <a href = "http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/scanview/inforce/s/1/?TITLE=%22Law%20Enforcement%20(Powers%20and%20Responsibilities)%20Act%202002%20No%20103%22&nohits=y">2002 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act</a> [text]. The state premier, <a href = "http://www.barryofarrell.com.au/">Barry O'Farrell</a> [official website] promised that face coverings would only be removed for brief identification and that those with religious objections can go to a police station to be identified in complete privacy. The <a href = "http://www.icnsw.org.au/index.php?page=home">Islamic Council of NSW</a> [advocacy website] is reportedly <a href = "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/police-back-nsw-face-covering-laws/story-fn7x8me2-1226118338303">fine with the new regulations</a> [AAP report].

<p>Australia is the latest in an international trend to ban the wearing of <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqas</a>, <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=niqab">niqabs</a> [JURIST news archives] or full face veils in some situations. Earlier this month, an Italian parliamentary commission <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/italy-lawmakers-approve-draft-burqa-ban-law.php">approved a draft law</a> [JURIST report] that bans women from wearing full-face veils, including the Islamic burqa and niqab in public. In July, Belgium implemented a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-burqa-ban-takes-effect.php">banning women from wearing the burqa</a> [JURIST report] in public, with violators facing the possibility of fines or up to seven days in jail. A French Muslim couple living in the UK <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-muslim-couple-to-challenge-burqa-ban-in-echr-spain-court-uupholds-city-ban.php">filed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] in June in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] over the French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/dissimulation_visage_espace_public.asp">ban</a> [materials, in French] on full face coverings. Also in June, a Spanish court upheld a city ban on veils in municipal buildings for identification and security purposes. In October, the French Constitutional Council ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ban conforms with the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Also in October, Dutch politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=103">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website, in Dutch] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition. In August 2010, Austria's conservative <a href="http://www.fpoe.at/">Freedom Party</a> [official website, in German] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/conservative-austria-party-calls-for-vote-to-ban-minarets-face-veils.php">special vote</a> [JURIST report] on whether to ban face veils and the construction of minarets, two of the most visible symbols of the Islamic faith. In July 2010, Spain's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/spain-lower-house-rejects-proposal-to-ban-burqa.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to ban the burqa and other full face veils by a vote of 183 to 162 with two abstaining. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The order was issued on a motion to extend tolling of the statute of limitations by former members of the class action gender discrimination suit against the corporation. In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-277.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-277">Wal-Mart v. Dukes</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the group who filed the original claim <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-class-action-lawsuit-against-wal-mart.php">did not meet the requirements for class certification</a> [JURIST report]. The order, issued by US District Court Judge Charles Breyer, applies to those women who have already received the required permission to sue from the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website]. Those who have not already received permission from the EEOC have until next year to do so. 

<p>The original case was filed in 2001 by <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/public_home.html">female Wal-Mart employees</a> [class website] who contend that Wal-Mart's nationwide policies result in lower pay for women than men in comparable positions and longer waits for management promotions than men. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/wal-mart-appeals-class-action-certification-to-supreme-court.php">appealed</a> to the Supreme Court in August 2010 after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ninth-circuit-affirms-class.php">upheld class certification</a> [JURIST reports] in April 2010. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit originally ruled against Wal-Mart's appeal of the class certification in February 2007, then issued a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/12/10/0416688.pdf">new opinion</a> [text, PDF] in conjunction with its decision in December 2007. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/wal-mart-asks-ninth-circuit-to-dismiss.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Ninth Circuit in 2005, arguing that the six lead plaintiffs were not typical or common of the class. The certified class, which in 2001 was estimated to comprise more than 1.5 million women, includes all women employed by Wal-Mart nationwide at any time after December 26, 1998. It would have been the largest class action lawsuit in US history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al Megrahi was convicted of murdering 270 people in 2001 after blowing up <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6236538.stm">Pan Am Flight 103</a> [BBC backgrounder] over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988. The defense of al Megrahi's release drew the ire of opposition <a href="http://www.scottishlabour.org.uk/home">Scottish Labour Party</a> [official website] leader Iain Gray who called for Salmond to <a href="http://www.scottishlabour.org.uk/two-years-on--salmonds-refusal-to-apologise-arrogant-vain-and-st">apologize to the families of victims</a> [Scottish Labour Party report]. Gray stated it is an "insult to the victims that he refuses still to publish all the medical evidence the release was based on. If the decision was made for humanitarian reasons, he should do the humane thing and apologise for the pain caused to the relatives."

<p>Last August, Scottish Labour Party officials called for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/scotland-lawmakers-call-for-release-of-lockerbie-bomber-medical-records.php">publication of all medical evidence related to the release</a> [JURIST report] of al-Megrahi. The demand came one year after al Megrahi was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/scotland-justice-secretary-orders.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from prison on compassionate grounds because doctors predicted he only had three months to live. Despite the publication of a report leading to the decision, the Labour party said that all medical opinions leading to the decision and the names of the doctors who authored them <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-10924910">should also be released</a> [BBC report]. Responding to criticism of his decision to release al Megrahi, Scottish <a href="http://www.kennymacaskill.co.uk/">Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill</a> [official website] claimed he acted in good faith when authorizing the release, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/scotland/7936080/Lockerbie-bomber-decision-taken-in-good-faith.html">denying that there was an arrangement</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] for al Megrahi to drop his appeal in return for his release. Al Megrahi returned to his native Libya, where he is still living, and experts have suggested that he <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/COGRA/APWorldNews/Article_2011-08-20-EU-Britain-Lockerbie/id-fca99cf2898f4480b5cbb94e25d20d5b">could continue living for several more years</a> [AP report]. Al Megrahi's release was controversial, with both <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/us-officials-criticize-lockerbie-bomber.php">US officials</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/scotland-parliament-votes-to-condemn.php">Scottish Parliament</a> [JURIST reports] condemning it. Last year, US lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-lawmakers-call-for-investigation-into-bp-involvement-in-release-of-lockerbie-bomber.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the role that oil company <a href="http://www.bp.com/bodycopyarticle.do?categoryId=1&contentId=7052055">British Petroleum</a> (BP) [corporate website] may have played in al Megrahi's release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The order provides temporary relief until a lawsuit, filed last month by <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/centralnc/">Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina</a> (PPCNC) [advocacy website], <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/planned-parenthood-seeks-to-block-north-carolina-from-defunding-it.php">seeking to overturn the restriction</a> [JURIST report] can be heard. Judge James Beaty, Jr. <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/08/19/1424131/judge-temporarily-halts-nc-planned.html">cited the legislative history</a> [AP report] behind the state's <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H200v9.pdf">budget</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&BillID=H200">materials</a>], passed over the veto of <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website], in ruling that section 10.19 was included in the bill as a politically-motivated effort to improperly penalize the organization. Janet Colm, president of PPCNC, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/local-press-releases/local-news-press-release-37084.htm">described</a> [press release] the decision as, "a strong ruling that Planned Parenthood is likely to prevail on all of our arguments and that an injunction is needed to ensure that uninsured and low-income women, men, and teens of North Carolina continue to have access to basic health care and education." PPCNC said that over the last fiscal year, it provided health family planning and reproductive health exams for nearly 7,000 women, as well as providing almost 8,300 tests for sexually transmitted diseases.

<p>Several states have made efforts similar to North Carolina's attempt to cut funding for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] services. The state of Kansas <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/kansas-appeals-order-to-block-law-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an appeal earlier this month seeking to overturn a federal judge's ruling that blocks a state law preventing <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/kansas-mid-missouri/">Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri</a> (PPKM) [advocacy website] from receiving federal funding. The same week, the <a href="http://aclj.org/">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-urged-to-uphold-indiana-abortion-funding-restrictions.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief seeking to uphold an Indiana state law that would block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood of Indiana (PPIN) [advocacy website] and other organizations providing abortion services. In June, Perdue also <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina bill that would have required women seeking an abortion to wait 24 hours and to view an ultrasound of the fetus before an abortion. Perdue called the measure "a dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors." The legislature later <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">overrode her veto</a> [JURIST report]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under Nebraska law, candidates for certain public offices may voluntarily <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/2009/Chapter32/32-1604.html">accept additional oversight in exchange for public financing</a> [Neb Rev Stat &#167; 1604], the levels of which may vary depending on the expenditures of privately-financed opponents. Additionally, no candidates may accept contributions from certain independent entities, including corporations, unions and professional organizations, that in aggregate total <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/nebraska/2009/Chapter32/32-1608.html">more than 50 percent of defined spending limitations</a> [Neb Rev Stat &#167; 1608]. Bruning's opinion predicts that, in light of the recent Arizona decision, these provisions would be overturned if evaluated by the Supreme Court on a strict scrutiny basis for failing to demonstrate a sufficiently overriding state interest. The <a href="http://nadc.nol.org/">Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission</a> [official website] is scheduled to meet next week to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/neb-g-finance-law-likely-unconstitutional-152456148.html">consider the opinion and potential remedies</a> [AP report] that may be implemented prior to the upcoming election cycle.

<p>In June, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-238.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-238">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that an Arizona campaign finance regulation that provided publicly financed candidates with additional government subsidies, triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates or by the candidates' privately financed opponents, violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The court held 5-4 that such a system substantially burdens political speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling state interest to satisfy the First Amendment. Counsel for the respondent argued that "public funding of elections results in more speech and more electoral competition" and furthers a governmental interest of staving off "real and apparent corruption in politics." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_bills&docid=f:s1998enr.txt.pdf">Stolen Valor Act</a> [text, PDF], enacted in 2005, makes it a federal crime for an individual to "falsely represent[] himself or herself, verbally or in writing, to have been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the Armed forces of the United States, any of the service medals or badges awarded to the members of such forces, the ribbon, button, or rosette of any such badge, decoration, or medal, or any colorable imitation of such item[.]" Violations are subject to fines and up to a year in jail. 

<p>The law has been challenged in federal courts in Colorado and California. The appeal to the Supreme Court comes in the case of <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/search_results.php?query=08-50345&search=1">US v. Alvarez</a> [materials], in which the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors.php">declared the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] last August. Although the panel conceded that Congress's intentions were "praiseworthy," it found that the law required courts to "extend inapposite case law to create an unprecedented exception to First Amendment guarantees" and was "not narrowly drawn" enough to survive First Amendment scrutiny. Alvarez was arrested after he gave a speech before the Three Valley Water District board of directors in California, to which he had recently been admitted, in which he claimed to be a retired marine and the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. In Colorado, the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] awaits arguments in the case of <a href="http://aclu-co.org/case/united-states-v-strandlof">US v. Strandlof</a> [ACLU materials]. Rick Strandlof was arrested in 2009 after he founded a veterans' club in Colorado Springs and claimed to have been awarded the purple heart.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hicks, an Australian national, is asking the Australian government to "request the US authorities to formally overturn" his 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/us-re-charging-guantanamo-detainees.php">conviction on charges of aiding terrorism</a> before a US military court and nullify the <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/hicks-pleads-guilty-to-supporting.php">plea deal</a> [JURIST reports] from which the conviction arose. The 107-page document, authored on his behalf by human rights lawyer and <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/law/">Sydney Law School</a> [academic website] professor <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/law/about/staff/BenSaul/index.shtml">Ben Saul</a> [academic profile], also asks for a federal investigation into the treatment to which Hicks alleges he was subjected while in US custody. Among the allegations are that Hicks was drugged, beaten and sexually abused while at Guantanamo, and that he was coerced into his plea deal without access to evidence. The pleading further avers that for its compliance with US authorities, the Australian government was complicit in numerous human rights violations against Hicks under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text].  The plea concludes that:<blockquote>Australia should compensate Mr. Hicks for the violation of his ... rights, and in particular for seven months of unlawful, arbitrary detention in Australia and for the restrictions imposed upon his liberty and freedom by the imposition of a control order.... Australia should provide an assurance to Mr. Hicks that its law enforcement authorities will not seek to confiscate any literary proceeds which Mr. Hicks may derive from publishing or otherwise communicating for profit the story of this trial, conviction and related conduct.</blockquote>Hicks has sold approximately 30,000 copies of his book, <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Books/GUANTANAMO-MY-JOURNEY/9781864711585/Hardback/"><em>Guantanamo, My Journey</em></a> [publisher materials], which chronicles his time at Guantanamo and the subsequent seven-month sentence he served in an Australian prison under a control order imposed by the country conditional to his release from US custody. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/sc">New South Wales Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/court-freezes-proceeds-of-hicks-book-20110803-1iao6.html">froze all assets</a> [<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> report] arising out of the sale of the book.

<p>Australian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/australia-government-lifts-control.php">removed the final restrictions against Hicks</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008. Following his guilty plea, Hicks was <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/hicks-transferred-to-australia-to.php">transferred to Australia</a> in May 2007 to serve the remainder of his nine-month prison sentence at a maximum security prison near his hometown of Adelaide, South Australia, and was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ex-guantanamo-bay-detainee-hicks.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in December 2007. The control order was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/australia-court-relaxes-control-order.php">relaxed</a> [JURIST report] in February 2008, permitting Hicks to live anywhere in the country, and requiring him to check in with police only twice a week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Though many contest the constitutionality of the removal process, <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile] has said that the IEC has the <a href="http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/08/21/iec-unseats-9-wolesi-jirga-members">final authority over election complaints</a> [PAN report] reviewed and determined by a special court. After the special court ordered the removal of 62 lawmakers in June, a determination <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/afghan-court-overturns-parliamentary-election-results-for-fraud.php">overturned by the IEC</a> [JURIST report], the recent IEC announcement appears to be a compromise meant to settle the 2010 election controversy.  

<p>With the US withdrawing troops, ongoing disputes over irregularities in last September's parliamentary elections have raised doubts about the stability of the Afghan government. In January, Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-president-orders-delay-in-seating-of-new-parliament.php">postponed the seating</a> [JURIST report] of Parliament following a request by the special court for more time to look into allegations of fraud surrounding the elections. <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-high-court-to-investigate-election-complaints-possibly-changing-results.php">Karzai had promised</a> [JURIST report] to have the special court review the election results in time to seat the election by the original January deadline. But the IEC claimed that the special did not have legal authority to question the results that it certifies because the law says it has the final say in determining the elections results. In November, the Afghanistan <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/afghanistan-officials-disqualify-21-parliamentary-candidates-for-fraud.php">disqualified 21 candidates</a> [JURST report] for electoral fraud after finding widespread voting irregularities in 12 provinces. Of the disqualified candidates, 19 had either won or were leading in their districts, seven of which were incumbents, and two were second place finishers in districts where the first place finisher was also disqualified. In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">IEC invalidated 1.3 million votes</a> [JURIST report], nearly a quarter of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide, due to findings of fraud. The IEC found that the 2,543 polling stations where the votes had been cast did not follow IEC procedures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST reports] in late June. Last year, the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/courts/maljudiciary.shtml">Federal Court of Malaysia</a> [official website], the country's highest court, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/malaysia-high-court-rejects-former-opposition-leaders-defamation-suit.php">rejected Anwar's 2006 defamation suit</a> against against former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] for allegedly suggesting at a human rights conference that Anwar was unfit for office because of his supposed homosexuality. Anwar was Malaysia's deputy prime minister under Mahathir until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

They were the first US citizens to die in the recent wave of international maritime piracy attacks. Ali Abdi Mohamed was the first to be <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015981855_apusprosecutingpirates1stldwritethru.html">sentenced</a> [AP report] of 11 men who pleaded guilty to hijacking a US yacht called Quest in February.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pirates">Maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive] off the coast of African continues to be a global concern.

The UNHRC began a special session on Monday to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39346&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">discuss the possibility of an investigation</a> [press release] after the Fact-finding Mission in Syria published a 22-page report last week concluding that Syrian government forces cracking down on the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. During Monday's special session, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile], who noted that more than 2,000 people had been killed since the protests including hundreds during the month of Ramadan, also urged the Syrian government to stop its indiscriminate attacks on peaceful protesters and to release all persons detained for participating in those protests. The resolution will require the Syrian government to fully comply with a commission that will investigate alleged crimes against humanity that have taken place since March, with the commission reporting back no later than November.

<p>The emergency meeting was held in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">plea</a> [JURIST report] from Pillay last week to refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for an investigation into the violent suppression of anti-government protests. Many steps have been taken to try and halt the violence in Syria this year. Last week, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that an unknown Western country is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Syria's recent human rights abuses. In July, two UN rights officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">expressed concern over reports of violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people. Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide Francis Deng and Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect Edward Luck said that reports of Syrian forces killing or arbitrarily arresting peaceful protesters indicate potentially grievous violations of international human rights laws, and urged officials to adhere to the government's 2005 pledge to protect its citizens. In June, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-urges-investigation-of-syria-abuses.php">published a preliminary report</a> [JURIST report] describing human rights violations in Syria and calling for an investigation into government-authorized abuses related to pro-democracy protests that began earlier this year. In April, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">urged Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">Fact-finding Mission was established</a> [JURIST report] by the UNHRC in April, but was not permitted to enter the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The request comes in response to a <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/decisions/2011/USPU12626EN.doc">report</a> [text, DOC; <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/Comunicados/English/2011/92-11eng.htm">press release</a>] published by the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] last week attributing to the US government human rights violations against Jessica Lenahan (Gonzales), who was a victim of her husband's domestic abuse. Lenahan's former husband killed their three daughters, despite a restraining order and Lenahan's repeated efforts to contact law enforcement officers. In an effort to prevent similar domestic hostility, Manjoo urged the US government to reexamine laws currently in place:<blockquote>Violence against women is the most pervasive human rights violation which continues to challenge every country in the world, and the US is no exception. The US Government should reassess existing mechanisms for protecting victims and punishing offenders, and establish meaningful standards for enforcement of protection orders and impose consequences for a failure to enforce them.</blockquote>Manjoo also made recommendations for crafting and implementing new legislation, emphasizing that women are affected differently by domestic violence particularly with respect to their social, economic and cultural positions. Furthermore, she said, "structural and institutional discrimination perpetuate and exacerbate women's experiences of abuse."

<p>Domestic violence laws created in response to Lenahan's circumstances have faced challenges. The <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/">California Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/documents/G038379.PDF">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in November 2008 that the residency requirements associated with <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Sex_Offender_Facts/Jessicas_Law.html">Proposition 83</a> [DAPO backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/california-court-says-sex-offender.php">amount to additional punishment for sex offenders</a> [JURIST report]. Proposition 83, or Jessica's Law, prohibits sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of any school or park where children regularly gather. Californians voted in favor of Proposition 83 in November 2006. The law faced an immediate <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/california-proposition-on-sex.php">legal challenge</a> [JURIST report] from unidentified registered sex offenders, and a federal judge issued a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/federal-judge-blocks-california-sex.php">temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the enforcement of the law's residency requirements, pending a ruling on the merits. In February 2007, a federal district judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/federal-judge-bars-retroactive.php">barred the law</a> [JURIST report] from applying retroactively. By September 2007 the <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/california-officials-order-thousands-of.php">notified</a> [JURIST report] the 2,741 paroled sex offenders in the state that they were required to move under the Proposition 83 requirements. The US Supreme Court <a href="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/27jun20051200/www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/04pdf/04-278.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in May 2005 that Gonzales did not have a constitutional right to police enforcement of the restraining order in place against her husband and that <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/high-court-rules-police-cant-be-sued.php">police officers are immune</a> [JURIST report] from suits based on how they enforce restraining orders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Liberians were <a href="http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1077:rsieh&catid=41:liberia-2011&Itemid=117">slated to vote today</a> [<em>Front Page Africa</em> report] on four constitutional amendments, including a provision to change the election date to avoid the rainy season, as well as a stipulation to alter the residency requirement for presidential and vice presidential candidates. In the midst of the first national referendum to be held in the country in 25 years, voters reportedly found an error on the ballot proposing a change to the retirement age of Supreme Court judges. The error left voters confused when casting their ballots. Deputy Coordinator of the referendum organizing team, Amos Koukou, said instructions for voting with the defective ballots had been placed at voting stations. 

<p>Despite the referendum, Liberia has been criticized for its poor human rights record in recent years. UN <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33851&amp;Cr=liberia&amp;Cr1=">emphasized</a> [UN News Centre report] in a 2010 progress <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2010/88">report</a> [text, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/liberia-reconciliation-efforts-must.php">reconciliation in Liberia</a> [JURIST report] hinges on the development of its national security and its legal institutions. <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/liberia-facing-poor-human-rights.php">Liberia struggles</a> [JURIST report] with corruption in its criminal justice system, poor detention conditions and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and forced marriage, according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmil/">UN Mission in Liberia</a> [official website] combined quarterly <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unmil.org/documents/humanrights_may_oct_2007_report.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unmil.org/article.asp?id=2713">press release</a>] released in April 2008.

The TRC is investigating possible war crimes that occurred during the civil war that ended in 2003, but does not have the authority to try cases. <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2963086.stm">Former Liberian President Charles Taylor</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=charles+taylor">news archive</a>] is currently awaiting a verdict from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> [official website] for crimes against humanity.

Judge William Pauley, however, ruled in favor of the defendants on several key issues, holding that MP3tunes qualified for safe harbor under the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/hr2281.pdf">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (DMCA) [text, PDF] with respect to certain sideloaded music and that MP3tunes complied with DMCA guidelines for responding to certain takedown notices. Michael Robertson, founder of MP3tunes, <a href="http://www.michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=350#disqus_thread">called the ruling a "99 percent victory"</a> [press release] for his company:<blockquote>Today a ruling was published in EMI v MP3tunes and it is definitely a victory for cloud music and MP3tunes' business model after a multi-year litigation battle. Consumers can have confidence that they'll be able to store, play, and enjoy music using cloud-based services like MP3tunes. Those in the industry that are building or contemplating personal music service like Amazon, Google, Grooveshark and Dropbox will surely have renewed confidence in offering similar unlicensed services.</blockquote> The <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/court-ruling-could-hurt-cloud-based-music-services/">case will proceed to trial</a> [NYT report] to determine damages, which could amount to tens of millions of dollars. Robertson indicated that he is currently exploring appeal options.

<p>The US music industry has been actively litigating alleged copyright infringement in person-to-person online file sharing. In July, a federal judge <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/60635512/Order-on-Motions-to-Amend-Alter-Verdict-in-Capitol-v-Thomas-Rasset">reduced</a> [order, PDF] a $1.5 million jury verdict against a Minnesota woman who was found to have willfully shared music files to $54,000. Chief Judge Michael Davis of the <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/index.shtml">US District Court for the District Court of Minnesota</a> [official website] called the award "appalling" and inconsistent with due process. Davis emphasized that the defendant was an individual consumer who downloaded music for her own use and not for profit and also said that the damages to the plaintiffs, members of the Recording Industry Association of America, did not support the verdict. The RIAA <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/RIAA+Appeals+Last+Months+Damages+Reduction+for+Jammie+ThomasRasset/article22515.htm">appealed the damages reduction</a> Tuesday. In May, several major record companies announced that they had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/record-companies-reach-settlement-with-file-sharing-site-limewire.php">reached a $105 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] with music file-sharing website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.limewire.com/">LimeWire</a> [website]. In 2008, the RIAA said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/riaa-abandons-lawsuits-for-filesharing.php">discontinue its controversial policy</a> [JURIST report] of suing suspected file-sharers and instead will seek cooperation with major Internet service providers to cut off access to repeat offenders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontthailand.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on human trafficking <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/trafficking/CVJoyNgoziEzeilo.htm">Joy Ngozi Ezeilo</a> [official profile] on Monday urged the government of Thailand to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11319&LangID=E">improve measures to combat human trafficking</a> [press release], as well as protect the rights of migrant workers. The trafficking trade in Thailand is predominantly used for sexual and labor exploitation, with child trafficking especially rampant. Individuals are forced into prostitution, pornography, domestic work and surrogacy, among other abuses. Ezeilo described Thailand as a "source, transit and destination" country, meaning citizens are recruited in Thailand and the country both receives and sends individuals through trafficking channels. The special rapporteur applauded the <a href="http://www.baliprocess.net/files/Thailand/1.%20trafficking_in_persons_act_b.e%202551%20%28eng.%29.pdf">Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2008</a> [text, PDF] and the multidisciplinary teams that are stationed in Thai provinces and tasked with addressing trafficking problems, but said the implementation and enforcement of anti-trafficking measures were weak. Ezeilo called for a proactive stance against human trafficking and urged Thailand to combat trafficking on an international level:<blockquote>In the context of Thailand, the role of prevention is critical in ensuring that the crime of trafficking does not occur in the first place. The Government must not neglect the development and implementation of comprehensive and systematic prevention measures as it continue to intensify efforts to developing assistance programmes for survivors of trafficking and to prosecute traffickers and stop the impunity of human trafficking. Finally, I urge Thai government to show clear leadership in the ASEAN region and beyond in combating human trafficking, protecting the rights of migrant workers and their vulnerabilities to trafficking in persons.</blockquote>Ezeilo made numerous recommendations for implementing effective measures to combat trafficking, including a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and trafficking, as well as the creation of shelters for victims.

<p>Thailand is not the sole country facing human trafficking challenges. In June 2010, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] released its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/142979.pdf">annual report</a> [text, PDF] on human trafficking conditions across the globe, finding that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-state-department-issues-annual-report-on-human-trafficking.php">US adequately complies</a> [JURIST report] with international regulations but still has a "'serious problem with human trafficking, both for labor and commercial sexual exploitation." It was the tenth annual report on human trafficking by the DOS, following reports in <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/us-human-trafficking-report-adds-6.php">2009</a> [JURIST report], <a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/index.htm">2008</a> [materials], <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-human-trafficking-report-cites.php">2007</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/human-trafficking-still-major-problem.php">2006</a> [JURIST reports]. That same month, the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/publications/TiP_Europe_EN_LORES.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] detailing the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/human-trafficking-in-europe.php">ongoing problem of human trafficking</a> [JURIST report] in Europe. According to the report, European criminal organizations make a yearly profit of around $3 billion from trafficking humans for sexual exploitation or forced labor. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ruled that sex trafficking <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/europe-court-rules-sex-trafficking.php">violates conventions</a> [JURIST report] against slavery and forced labor. The US and the EU announced in October 2009 an <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-and-eu-reach-agreement-on-treaty-for.php">international criminal treaty</a> [JURIST report] that will greatly increase cooperation between the two governments in fighting the trafficking of humans and the sale of illegal drugs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lubanga is <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/international-criminal-court-lays.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with enlisting child soldiers in his militia, which is believed to have committed large-scale human rights abuses in Congo's violent Ituri district. His trial began in January 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/icc-reluctantly-stays-trial-of-congo-ex.php">after being delayed for evidentiary reasons</a> and was halted soon after when one of the child witnesses <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/lubanga-war-crimes-trial-resumes-after.php">recanted his testimony</a> [JURIST reports] that Lubanga had recruited him for the militia. The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-concludes-case-in-trial-of.php">concluded its case</a> [JURIST report] last July after presenting 22 weeks of testimony. Lubanga <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/congo-ex-militia-leader-lubanga-pleads.php">maintains he is innocent</a> [JURIST report] of the charges against him. The prosecution and defense lawyers <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE77N32P20110824?sp=true">will present closing arguments</a> [Reuters report] later this week, followed by deliberation by a three-judge panel. A verdict will likely be handed down in early 2012.

<p>The ICC has also been involved with prosecutorial aspects of the <a href="/feature/2011/06/libya.php">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder], which has been ongoing since February. ICC representatives were <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-in-talks-with-libya-rebels-to-hand-over-gaddafi-son-for-prosecution.php">reportedly meeting</a> [JURIST report] Monday with Libyan rebels to discuss turning over the son of Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, to the court for prosecution.

On the other hand, the ICC has been criticized for lack of involvement with respect to other war crimes allegations. UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> last week to refer Syria to the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">investigate the violent suppression</a> [JURIST report] of anti-government protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pojamarn and step-brother Bannapot Damapong were each sentenced to three years, and her secretary was sentenced to two years imprisonment for the crime. The three appealed, and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvMP0B_Rvbb9cEUjCDN3dhb_ajPw?docId=CNG.ab6a023abc4bca61d69e51d9e33468b7.201">all three convictions were overturned</a> [AFP report].

They were arrested on terrorism charges stemming from their involvement in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thailand+protests">anti-government protests</a> [JURIST news archive] in Bangkok. In January, members of the movement also petitioned the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to launch a preliminary <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/thailand-red-shirts-petition-icc-to-review-violence-during-bangkok-protests.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether the government committed crimes against humanity during those protests.

In a report entitled <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA13/005/2011/en/c18ad74b-75fe-4b15-b043-5982eebdb27d/asa130052011en.pdf">"Crimes Unseen: Extrajudicial Executions in Bangladesh"</a> [text, PDF], AI alleges that the <a href="http://www.rab.gov.bd/">Rapid Action Battalion</a> (RAB) [official website], a special police force, unlawfully kills Bangladeshi civilians regularly. Furthermore, the RAB justifies the killings as accidental or insists that the victims were killed during gun fights. The AI report also contains accounts of detainee torture and use of excessive force by RAB officers. RAB has been accused of killing at least 700 people since its inception in 2004. Though RAB has claimed to be investigating the abuses, the proceedings remain secretive and not one investigation has led to a judicial prosecution. AI Bangladesh Researcher Abbas Faiz said that holding the RAB accountable will continue to be a challenge:<blockquote>However the authorities choose to describe such incidents, the fact remains that they are suspected unlawful killings. It is appalling that virtually all alleged instances of illegal RAB killings have gone unchallenged or unpunished. There can be no justice if the force is the chief investigator of its own wrong-doings. Such investigations cannot be impartial. There is nothing to stop the RAB from destroying the evidence and engineering the outcome.</blockquote>RAB continues to deny allegations of extrajudicial killings. AI called on the government of Bangladesh to establish an impartial commission to investigate abuses purportedly committed by RAB and make those findings public.

<p>Extrajudicial killing has been an ongoing problem in Bangladesh. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/bangladesh0509webwcover.pdf">urged</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/rights-group-urges-bangladesh.php">report</a>] the new <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/">Bangladesh government</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bangladesh">news archive</a>] in May 2009 to investigate torture, illegal detentions and extrajudicial killings allegedly conducted by the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) and the RAB. The news <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/eu-expresses-deep-concern-over.php">echoed similar findings</a> [JURIST report] reported by the EU in June 2007. In April 2009, the Bangladesh government <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/bangladesh-exploring-trial-of-1971-war.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it was working with the UN to organize <a href="/currentawareness/warcrimes.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST news archive] prosecutions for alleged violations stemming from the country's <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 War of Independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] against <a href="/countries/pakistan.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST news archive] and that is considering trial in the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website].

Hadzic waived his right to appeal extradition and, after visiting with a few relatives in Serbia, was flown to The Hague. The court has not set any dates for further appearances. 

<p>Hadzic was a key player in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] and has been at large for approximately seven years. Hadzic's <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/hadzic/cis/en/cis_hadzic_en.pdf">official charges</a> [case information sheet, PDF] are: persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; extermination; murder; torture; inhumane acts; deportation and forcible transfer; cruel treatment; wanton destruction of villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity; destruction or willful damage done to institutions dedicated to education and religion; and plunder of public or private property. Hadzic's indictment contends that, in his role as president of the Serbian nationalist forces during the war, he attempted to permanently and forcibly remove a majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from the disputed territory. He is accused of murdering or ordering the murders of hundreds of non-Serb citizens, including children and the elderly. Further, he allegedly displaced more than 20,000 non-Serb civilians.

The defendants are owners of <a href="http://www.compassionateapothecary.com/">Compassionate Apothecary</a> (CA) [company website], a privately owned medical marijuana dispensary that facilitates patient-to-patient transfer of marijuana using a locker system for patients to store and trade excess marijuana. CA retains 20 percent of the proceeds from each transaction and has 345 members that are certified by the state to use marijuana for medicinal purposes. A county attorney general filed a complaint against the owners seeking to enjoin operations for failing to comply with the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28tp3nth45sqomzy455d1r4fu3%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Initiated-Law-1-of-2008">Michigan Medical Marihuana Act</a> (MMMA) [text]. Judge Joel Hoekstra's opinion focused on the definition and application of terminology in the relevant statutes:<blockquote>The word "use" has numerous dictionary definitions, as does the word "administer." However, each word has a definition that relates directly to controlled substances or medicines, and we find those definitions to be the most relevant. To "use" means "to drink, smoke, or ingest habitually." ... Employing these definitions, we hold that a person assists a registered qualifying patient with "using or administering" marihuana when the person assists the patient in preparing the marihuana to be consumed in any of the various ways that marihuana is commonly consumed or by physically aiding the patient in consuming the marihuana.</blockquote>The three-judge panel concluded that CA was a public nuisance in violation of the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28iqohad55yf4kvrycygtpfk45%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-368-of-1978">Public Health Code</a> (PHC) [text], which prohibits the possession and delivery of marijuana, holding that the owners' locker system constituted possession and delivery of marijuana. 

<p>US Courts have been forced to interpret medical marijuana statutes in recent years. Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] announced in June that the state is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-file-lawsuit-over-controversial-state-medical-marijuana-law.php">filing a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a declaratory judgment over the legality of the state's controversial medical marijuana law passed last November. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-rejects.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state's <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials]. Earlier that month, New Jersey became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">fourteenth US state</a> [JURIST report] to legalize medical marijuana. In November 2009, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an expansion of the state's existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine the fifth state to allow dispensaries, following California, Colorado, Rhode Island and New Mexico. California's Fourth District Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 that the MMP is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-court-rules-medical.php">not in conflict with the Supremacy Clause</a> [JURIST report] and does not violate the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pavlyuchenkov purportedly organized a criminal unit to carry out the murder in exchange for money. A spokesperson for Russia's federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, also indicated that the agency had procured information about the unidentified mastermind of the murder, but has not yet made that information public.

<p>A human rights activist and critic of the Kremlin, Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in an elevator of her apartment building in Moscow as she was returning home. Politkovskaya investigated human rights abuses in Chechnya and high-level corruption across Russia, and her death raised concerns about the safety of journalists and other critics of the government. At the time she was working for the low-circulation independent newspaper <a href="http://www.newtimes.ru/"><em>Novaya Gazeta</em></a> [official website, in Russian] where she was writing reports on Chechnya. Her death was widely believed to be a contract killing.

The advertising led to unlawful importation of controlled and non-controlled prescription drugs into the US, which constitutes violations of the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/federalfooddrugandcosmeticactfdcact/default.htm">Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</a> and the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt">Controlled Substances Act</a> [texts]. The settlement amount is comparable to the combined gross revenue Google generated from the <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=adwords&hl=en_US&ltmpl=regionalc&passive=false&ifr=false&alwf=true&continue=https://adwords.google.com/um/gaiaauth?apt%3DNone&error=newacct">AdWords</a> [product site] advertisements as well as the revenue earned by the Canadian pharmaceutical companies from introducing the prescription drugs to US markets. US Attorney Peter Neronha said the large settlement would act as a deterrent to drug manufacturers and online advertising companies:<blockquote>This investigation is about the patently unsafe, unlawful, importation of prescription drugs by Canadian on-line pharmacies, with Google's knowledge and assistance, into the United States, directly to U.S. consumers. It is about taking a significant step forward in limiting the ability of rogue on-line pharmacies from reaching U.S. consumers, by compelling Google to change its behavior. It is about holding Google responsible for its conduct by imposing a $500 million forfeiture, the kind of forfeiture that will not only get Google's attention, but the attention of all those who contribute to America's pill problem.</blockquote>Pursuant to the agreement, Google acknowledges that it unlawfully advertised for the Canadian pharmaceutical company. The DOJ also enumerated several compliance guidelines aiming to prevent similar episodes. 

<p>The lawsuit against Google was the unintended result of an investigation into a string of "rogue online pharmacies" that used Google's AdWords to unlawfully market prescription drugs. Google <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703860104575507950332558806.html">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [WSJ report] against the pharmaceutical advertisers in September 2010. The DOJ discovered advertisements for the unlawful sale of drugs on Google's AdWords during that investigation. AdWords allows advertisers, for a fee, to select keywords that, when searched by a Google user, bring up a link to the advertiser's website. The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo1_6308/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] said in an <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&amp;Submit=rechercher&amp;numaff=C-236/08">advisory opinion</a> [materials; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2009-09/cp090075en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] handed down in September 2009 that Google's AdWords, a system that causes advertisements to be shown alongside natural search results on Google, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/ecj-advisory-opinion-finds-google-ad.php">does not violate EU trademark law</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court instructed that judges in future cases should hold pretrial hearings to determine all possible variables to the eyewitness testimony as well as administering jury instructions, sometimes mid-way through trial, that explain possible variables specific to the case that could have eroded a witness' memory of the incident. The unanimous opinion relied largely on several scientific studies that have discredited eyewitness testimony:<blockquote>We find that the scientific evidence presented is both reliable and useful. Despite arguments to the contrary, we agree with the Special Master that "[t]he science abundantly demonstrates the many vagaries of memory encoding, storage, and retrieval; the malleability of memory; the contaminating effects of extrinsic information; the influence of police interview techniques and identification procedures; and the many other factors that bear on the reliability of eyewitness identifications. The research presented on remand is not only extensive, but as Dr. Monahan testified, it represents the "gold standard in terms of the applicability of social science research to the law." Experimental methods and findings have been tested and retested, subjected to scientific scrutiny through peer-reviewed journals, evaluated through the lens of meta-analyses, and replicated at times in real-world settings. As reflected above, consensus exists among the experts who testified on remand and within the broader research community.</blockquote>The ruling also gave suggestions for police officers to reform how they conduct lineups. The <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/">Innocence Project</a> [advocacy website], which filed an <em>amicus</em> brief, was <a href = "http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/New_Jersey_Supreme_Court_Issues_Landmark_Decision_Mandating_Major_Changes_in_the_Way_Courts_Handle_Identification_Procedures.php">pleased</a> [press release] with the decision, saying it will ultimately affect every court in the nation and calling on the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to make similar findings.

<p>In May, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/053111zor.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in a case over a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rejects-conrad-black-appeal.php">suspect identification</a> [JURIST report]. The court will hear <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-8974.htm">Perry v. New Hampshire</a> [docket], in which Barion Perry is <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/05/31/2243360/court-to-clarify-witness-identification.html">challenging his conviction</a> [AP report] for breaking into a car based on a witness identifying him as the perpetrator while he was in handcuffs under police custody. The witness claims she saw Perry break into the car and steal things but later could neither pick him out of a photo line-up nor describe his appearance. Perry argues that the identification was suggestive since he was in handcuffs, making him look like a criminal. In 2008, a UK study suggested that an eyewitness' ability to recall specific details of an incident <a href = "/paperchase/2008/07/eyewitness-testimony-increasingly.php">decreases dramatically in high-stress situations</a> [JURIST report]. The study, conducted by Tin Valentine and Jan Mesout of <a href="http://www.writing.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths</a> [academic website], part of the University of London, measured participants' ability to recall details about an actor instructed to jump out at visitors as they moved through a "fun-house" maze. The study found that participants who reported being more stressed during the visit consistently failed to correctly identify specific details about the actor afterwards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the agency has arraigned 45 different government officials, HRW believes their trials are moving too slowly and is concerned about the small sentences for the four officials who have been convicted. Due to corrupt officials siphoning the profits from Nigeria's vast oil reserves, human rights programs receive little funding and have not advanced in the nation.<blockquote>The broadest obstacle any effort to tackle corruption in Nigeria faces is this: the country's political system is built to reward corruption, not punish it. Too often, corruption is a prerequisite for success in Nigeria's warped political process. Since 1999, elections have been stolen more often than won, and many politicians owe their illicitly-obtained offices to political sponsors who demand financial "returns" that can only be raised through corruption. Put simply, the day-to-day functioning of Nigeria's political system constantly and directly undermines the EFCC's work.</blockquote>HRW had a number of recommendations for the nation, including for state governments to modernize their judicial systems and for the government to embrace transparency. The report also endorsed several pieces of legislation: the <a href = "http://allafrica.com/stories/201002151368.html">Evidence Act</a> [AllAfrica report], the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/nigeria-official-calls-for-special-corruption-court.php">Special Courts Establishment Bill</a> [JURIST report] and amending the <a href = "http://www.codeofconductbureau.com/">Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act</a> [official website].

<p>Earlier this month, the Nigerian Ebonyi State Commissioner of Justice and Attorney General, Ben Igwenyi, called for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nigeria-official-calls-for-special-corruption-court.php">establishment of a special court to hear corruption cases</a> [JURIST report]. He argued that corruption cases in the regular courts take too long to process, causing people to forget about them and perpetuating the appearance of corruption in the government. He proposed merging the <a href="http://www.icpc.gov.ng/">Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission</a> (ICPC), which investigates corruption, and the EFCC to form an anti-corruption court. Corruption remains a problem in Nigeria as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/nigeria-anti-corruption-agency-arrests-outgoing-house-speaker-on-fraud-allegations.php">EFCC arrested</a> [JURIST report] outgoing speaker of the House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole in June on allegations of fraud. He is believed to have secured a USD $ 66 million loan on top of his normal salary. In March, HRW and the <a href="http://www.nba.org.ng/">Nigerian Bar Association</a> [association website] called for Nigeria's National Assembly to pass legislation <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/13/nigeria-pass-bill-prosecute-electoral-abuses">creating a special electoral offenses commission</a> [statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/nigeria-legislature-urged-to-create-special-electoral-offences-commission.php">report</a>] tasked with investigating and prosecuting election-related abuses, including violence. In 2006, then Nigerian vice president <a href="http://www.nigeria.gov.ng/TheVicePresident.aspx">Atiku Abubakar</a> [official profile; <a href="http://www.atikuabubakar.net">official website</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/nigerian-vp-charged-with-corruption.php">charged with more than a dozen counts of corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the Code of Conduct Tribunal, a special corruption court that has the power to strip elected officials of immunity. The charges were related to the alleged diversion of $125 million dollars of public money to private interests, as well as allegations of receiving more than $4.6 million dollars in bribes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law requires school officials to verify the immigration status of children and parents, authorizes police to detain an individual and ask for papers if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" that the driver is in the country illegally and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. The <a href="http://www.nilc.org/immlawpolicy/LocalLaw/HICA-v-Bentley-PImotion-2011-07-21.pdf">motion for injunction</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-seek-to-bar-alabama-immigration-law.php">report</a>] was filed last month and alleges that HB 56 violates the First, Fourth and Sixth Amendments and the Supremacy and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> [text]. Rights groups <a href="http://www.nilc.org/pubs/news-releases/nr094.htm">argued</a> [statement] that the law will cause irreparable harm if not enjoined.<blockquote>Today's hearing highlighted why Alabama's law must be stopped in its tracks. The law makes it impossible for immigrant families to go to school, to make a living, to take care of routine business, and even to drive on a public road without fear of being punished under state law. This discriminatory law aims at undocumented immigrants, but catches lawful immigrants and U.S. citizens in the crossfire.</blockquote>The DOJ was joined by religious groups and representatives of several rights groups including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC), the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites]. The groups contend that HB 56 is "the most extreme" of the five most recent state laws influenced by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=SB+1070">Arizona SB 1070</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ago.state.al.us/">Alabama Attorney General's Office</a> [office website] requested that a certified question be answered by the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm">Alabama Supreme Court</a> [official website] prior to the commencement of district court proceedings. The attorney general wanted to ask the court to clarify the meaning of the provisions of HB 56 that void contracts with undocumented aliens and make transporting them a crime in light of the Alabama Constitution's <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/codeofalabama/constitution/1901/CA-170364.htm">religious freedom amendment</a> [text]. Alabama lawmakers filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">response</a> [JURIST report] to groups seeking a preliminary injunction against the controversial immigration law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontelsalvador.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.csj.gob.sv/idioma.html">Supreme Court of El Salvador</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Wednesday blocked the arrests and extradition of nine former soldiers accused of committing the 1989 "Jesuit Massacre," defying <A href = "http://www.interpol.int/default.asp">Interpol</a> [official website] red notices for the suspects. The court said that Spain had not presented a formal extradition request in its attempts to prosecute the individuals through <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=spain+and+%22universal+jurisdiction%22">universal jurisdiction</a> [JURIST news archive], stating that Interpol's warrant only required the suspects to be located, not detained or extradited for trial elsewhere. However, the court did <a href = "http://www.elfaro.net/es/201108/noticias/5496/">deny a claim by defendants</a> [<em>El Faro</em> report, in Spanish] that their arrest was arbitrary. The "Jesuit Massacre" occurred during El Salvador's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder], when right-wing soldiers murdered six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter for allegedly aiding the left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). Charges that the Jesuits stood with the FMLN were never proven. Although two of the soldiers who committed the massacre were tried and convicted in El Salvador, they were released after a year due to an amnesty pact. Spain <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/spain-court-charges-salvadoran-ex-military-officials-with-1989-jesuit-massacre.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] 20 soldiers for the attack in May, as five of the slain priests were Spanish. One of the suspects, former El Salvadoran defense minister Inocente Orlando Montano, was charged earlier this week for <a href = "http://www.boston.com/Boston/metrodesk/2011/08/suspect-murders-six-jesuit-priests-salvador-taken-into-custody-federal-officials/f8PyehZv9EO610Y2ImXY5K/index.html">immigration fraud</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report] in the <a href = "http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court of Massachusetts</a> [official website]. It is unknown if the US will extradite him to Spain under the same international indictment.

<p>Around 70,000 people were killed during El Salvador's civil war before a 1992 UN-brokered agreement brought peace to the country. In the past decade, the US has made significant strides in prosecuting those involved in the El Salvadoran civil war. In April, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-seeks-deportation-of-salvadoran-general-for-human-rights-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] General Eugenio Vides Casanova, former defense minister of El Salvador, for human rights crimes committed during the civil war while he served as the country's top military officer. The US was also <a href="http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/50168/2011/04/18/General-Vides-Casanova-podria-ser-deportado-de-EE-UU-acusado-de-tortura">seeking to deport</a> [<em>La Pagina</em> report, in Spanish] Vides, who retired in Florida after completing his six-year term as defense minister. In 2006, <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">$55 million verdict</a> [JURIST report] against Vides and his co-defendant Jose Guillermo Garcia for allowing torture and other human rights violations during the war. In 2005, a US federal court reached a verdict against Nicolas Carranza, top commander of El Salvador's security forces during the civil war, for <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/us-jury-finds-ex-salvadoran-colonel.php">$2 million in compensatory damages</a> [JURIST report]. The case was brought by five Salvadoran citizens who alleged torture or had family killed by Carranza's soldier during the war. In 2000, however, the US lost the  battle to seek justice for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/2-salvador-generals-cleared-by-us-jury-in-nuns-deaths.html?ref=joseguillermogarcia">murders of four American churchwomen</a> [NYT report] during the civil war when both Vides and Garcia were acquitted. The ruling was grounded in the doctrine that the generals, although responsible for their soldiers, may not have had complete effective power to reign in the abuses of their troops. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICTY hopes to hold one trial for his conduct during the <a href = "/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Mladic appeared in court and <a href = "http://www.expatica.com/nl/news/dutch-news/court-gives-mladic-lawyers-week-to-decide-on-split-trial_171570.html">remained silent</a> [AFP report]. Afterward, in a closed session, he discussed his health. Rumors that he has recently undergone surgery were <a href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/10779">rebutted</a> [press briefing] by the ICTY earlier this week. In a <a href = "http://rt.com/news/mladic-interview-srebrenica-massacre-155/">recently released interview from 1995</a> [RT report], Mladic justified the Srebrenica massacre by claiming Srebrenican Bosnian Muslims were attacking Serbian citizens indiscriminately with arms provided by Iran. He also claimed that no civilians were harmed and that mass graves were a necessity until the dead could be exchanged, but that every casualty received a proper Muslim burial. Mladic also stated in 1995 that he would not recognize a trial by non-Serbians.

<p>Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. At his <A href = "/paperchase/2011/07/mladic-removed-from-ICTY-courtroom,-guilty-plea-entered-appearance-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-him.php">second appearance</a> [JURIST report] he refused to enter a plea. Before that, he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports]. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for allegedly ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the massacre of Srebrenica during the Bosnian civil war, the largest European genocide since the Holocaust.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Officials fear that the 100-pound fish, which reproduce rapidly, could wipe out native species and destroy the $7 billion Great Lakes fishing industry. Although all parties agree the fish need to be dealt with, there is disagreement as to how. <a href = "http://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/">Illinois</a>, the <a href = "www.whitehouse.gov">Obama administration</a>, the <a href = "http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the <a href = "http://www.usace.army.mil/Pages/default.aspx">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official websites], thus far the prevailing parties, stand behind the <a href = "http://asiancarp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Final-Framework-Dec-15-10.pdf">Asian Carp Control Strategy Framework</a> [text, PDF], a law that encourages aggressive hunting and control of the fish species before they enter the Great Lakes. However, the plaintiffs, the states of Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and several intervening organizations, believe the best strategy would be to close two waterways in Chicago that allow the carp to reach the Great Lakes. The three-judge panel, although ultimately rejecting Michigan's request for an injunction, cautioned the federal government and Illinois on letting the carp population get out of control.<blockquote>We are less sanguine about the prospects of keeping the carp at bay. In our view, the plaintiffs presented enough evidence at this preliminary stage of the case to establish a good or perhaps even a substantial likelihood of harm&#8212;that is, a non-trivial chance that the carp will invade Lake Michigan in numbers great enough to constitute a public nuisance. If the invasion comes to pass, there is little doubt that the harm to the plaintiff states would be irreparable. That does not mean, however, that they are automatically entitled to injunctive relief. The defendants, in collaboration with a great number of agencies and experts from the state and federal governments, have mounted a full-scale effort to stop the carp from reaching the Great Lakes, and this group has promised that additional steps will be taken in the near future. ... In light of the active regulatory efforts that are ongoing, we conclude that an interim injunction would only get in the way. We stress, however, that if the agencies slip into somnolence or if the record reveals new information at the permanent injunction stage, this conclusion can be revisited.</blockquote>Several of the attorneys general involved have made <a href = "http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/appeals_court_wont_close_chica.html">statements</a> [AP report], including <a href = "http://www.doj.state.wi.us/">Wisconsin Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official website]. Van Hollen, in a <a href = "http://www.doj.state.wi.us/absolutenm/templates/template_share.aspx?articleid=2636&zoneid=1">press release</a> [text], said: "I believe the aggressive actions taken by Wisconsin and the other plaintiff states have forced the federal government to take this issue more seriously, and the Seventh Circuit acknowledges as much by suggesting that preliminary relief may very well be granted in the future, should the federal government's efforts wane." There is no indication that the states plan to appeal to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>The Supreme Court has <a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/26/asian-carp-supreme-court_n_551798.html">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [AP report] on the issue three times as of April 2010. The state of Michigan in December 2009 filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2009/12/michigan-sues-illinois-in-supreme-court.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the Supreme Court against the state of Illinois seeking to close the two waterways, as the court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the states. All three times, the court denied <em>certiorari</em> without comment on the dispute. Michigan reopened the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/12-21-09_Carp_Fact_Sheet_305177_7.pdf">longstanding controversy</a> [backgrounder, PDF] over the diversion canal, created in the 1890s to keep Chicago's sewage from flowing into Lake Michigan. The court issued decrees over the canal in 1930, 1933, 1956, 1967 and 1980.  The carp have been traveling up the Mississippi and Illinois rivers for years. Tests have showed that the carp may have gotten through an underwater electric barrier and may now be within six miles of Lake Michigan. The fish were originally imported to control algae in fisheries on the Mississippi River, but escaped during a 1990s flood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/taiwan-ex-president-chens-life-sentence-reduced-to-20-years.php">sentenced</a> Chen to 20 years in prison on embezzlement charges, but the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/taiwan-supreme-court-reduces-sentence-for-ex-president-chen.php">ordered a retrial</a> [JURIST reports] in November, citing insufficient evidence. Chen is currently serving a 17.5-year sentence on other corruption charges, and will now serve an additional two years and eight months, bringing his total sentence to over 20 years. His <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14678192">wife was also sentenced</a> [BBC report] to an additional 11 years at the retrial, but is unlikely to serve any time due to poor health.

<p>Chen Shui-bian and his wife were accused of taking more than $20 million in bribes from banks and financial institutions that sought to protect themselves during the implementation of Chen's financial reform program. The pair were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> in September 2009 after being convicted of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery and money laundering, but that sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/taiwan-ex-president-chens-life-sentence-reduced-to-20-years.php">later reduced</a> [JURIST reports]. Chen was again <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] shortly after the September sentence on additional corruption charges relating to funds he received while traveling abroad as president. Chen was initially detained in November 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">formally indicted</a> [JURIST report] the following month. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">unsuccessfully appealed</a> [JURIST report] his pretrial detention in January 2009. Chen served as president of Taiwan from 2000-2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking at the end of his five-day mission to Myanmar, Quintana said that the government must do more to fulfill its international human rights obligations. Quintana also urged the government to release political prisoners. He said that the government has made significant progress recently, but that <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11330&LangID=E">more must be done</a> [statement]:<blockquote>This is a key moment in Myanmar's history and there are real opportunities for positive and meaningful developments to improve the human rights situation and bring about a genuine transition to democracy. The new Government has taken a number of steps towards these ends. Yet, many serious human rights issues remain and they need to be addressed. I call on the Government to intensify its efforts to implement its own commitments and to fulfill its international human rights obligations. The international community needs to continue to remain engaged and to closely follow developments. The international community also needs to support and assist the Government during this important time. I reaffirm my willingness to work constructively and cooperatively with Myanmar to improve the human rights situation of its people.</blockquote>Quintana plans to make another visit to the country before his next report to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in March 2012.

<p>In May, Quintana said that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-ethnic-violence-limiting-transition-to-democracy-un-rights-expert.php">continued ethnic violence</a> [JURIST report] in Myanmar presents "serious limitations" to the government's transition to democracy. He does not believe that the government is doing enough to provide a political solution to the ethnic conflicts in the border areas. Earlier that month, Myanmar began releasing close to 15,000 prisoners, but many human rights groups claim the government is still holding many more political prisoners. Quintana urged Myanmar's military government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">release 2,202 political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] last December. Quintana called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," many of whom, he says, suffer from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy. In March, Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">underwent a transfer of power</a> [BBC report] from a military regime to a civil system after holding its first elections in 20 years. However, critics argue that the new regime is merely a sham since it is made up of military generals and with the military party winning 80 percent of the vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, enacted in July, enables prosecutors to choose their venue, increases the detainment period from 72 to 120 hours in extreme circumstances and prevents prisoners from contacting their lawyers for 48 hours. Baka explained that the provisions put the defendant at a severe disadvantage, endangering the concept of equality in the law: "the principle of equality of arms 'requires that protection is comparable with the weight of the accusations have powers.'" It is unknown if the Supreme Court will take Baka's suggestions.

<p>In April, the <a href="http://www.mkogy.hu/">National Assembly of Hungary</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php?Cikk=161564">approved</a> [statement, in Hungarian] a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report] by a margin of 262-44 and one abstention. The constitution introduces several changes, including a debt ceiling where the country's debt cannot exceed 50 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP); a reform of the Fiscal Council, giving the group the right to veto the budget and dissolve parliament for failure to pass an annual budget by the end of March; a definition of marriage as a union between man and woman; and a statement that the life of a fetus begins at and should be protected from conception. The constitution also includes a new <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php?Cikk=161565">preamble</a> [text, in Hungarian] that condemns the communist and socialist climate in Hungary that existed from 1944 to 1990 and solidifies democratization that began 20 years ago. Other laws passed by the FIDESZ-led parliament have garnered controversy. In February, the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hungary-agrees-to-change-controversial-media-law.php">agreed to change its controversial media law</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hungary-will-respond-to-eu-objections-over-strict-media-law.php">negotiations between Hungarian and EU representatives</a> [JURIST reports]. The law created the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites. Under the law, the government could fine broadcasters more than 700,000 euros and newspapers and news websites roughly 90,000 euros if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the NMHH, made up of members loyal to FIDESZ. The law was approved in December 2010 and went into effect in January amid protests from members of the media, other European governments as well as Amnesty International, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urges-hungary-to-amend-new-media-law.php">urged Hungary to amend the law</a> [JURIST report] because it curtails freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These rights include the right to unionize, to bargain collectively and to refuse pressures to do either. The poster also gives some examples of unfair business and union practices and information on contacting the NLRB. An official notice will be circulated that must be posted in all workplaces except very small businesses that do not affect interstate commerce and post offices. Failure to post the notice will be seen as an unfair labor practice, but the NLRB said that in general they will assume the business had not heard of the new regulation. Business rights advocacy groups have been <a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/26/nlrb-rule-posters-workplace_n_937907.html">outraged by the decision</a> [Huffington Post report]. The <a href = "http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> [advocacy website] said in a <a href = "http://www.nfib.com/nfib-on-the-move/nfib-on-the-move-item?cmsid=58046">statement</a> [text] that the NLRB had overreached its authority. The rule will be published in the Federal Register on August 30 and will take effect around <a href = "https://www.nlrb.gov/news-media/fact-sheets/final-rule-notification-employee-rights">November 15</a> [fact sheet].

<p>Restrictive collective bargaining laws have been advanced in several states this year. Ohio voters will decide whether to repeal a <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_SB_5_EN_N.pdf">law</a> [SB 5 text, PDF] limiting the collective bargaining rights of state workers after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ohio-collective-bargaining-law-to-go-before-voters-in-november.php">opponents of the bill gathered 915,456 signatures</a> [JURIST report] in late July. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ohio-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in March, but will not go into effect until it survives the public referendum in November. Also in July, a judge for the <a href="https://ecf.idd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Idaho</a> [official website] issued a <a href=/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-idaho-anti-union-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking the enforcement of an Idaho anti-union <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1007.pdf">law</a> [SB 1007] that bans a union program that subsidizes employment for its members. The law, called the Fairness in Contracting Act, prohibits union programs used by construction workers unions that pool portions of union wages on a voluntary basis to subsidize union labor to enable union members to be hired at the collectively bargained salary. Ten Wisconsin unions in June <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-union-sues-to-block-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit in federal court challenging the state's new collective bargaining law. The lawsuit alleges that the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11 text, PDF] violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [texts].

The court found that the law was incompatible with the <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/b-32.html">American Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] and ordered the Brazilian government to conduct a criminal investigation into an anti-guerrilla military operation in the Araguaia region between 1972 and 1974. However, the law has not been revoked, and a proposal for the creation of a truth commission to investigate crimes committed during the military regime has yet to be put before Congress. AI Americas Director Susan Lee said the "law is a scandal and doing nothing but preventing justice." She called on Brazil to uphold its international human rights commitments and immediately revoke the law.

<p>Other Latin American countries have also been working to revoke amnesty laws. In May, Uruguay's House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/uruguay-fails-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">failed to overturn</a> the country's amnesty law, despite it <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/uruguay-senate-votes-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">passing</a> [JURIST reports] the Senate in April. The IACHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/human-rights-court-invalidates-uruguay-military-amnesty-law.php">effectively overturned the law</a> [JURIST report] in April when it ruled that Uruguay's government must bring to justice those responsible for the disappearance of a woman abducted by Uruguay government forces in 1976. In November, the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.gub.uy/">Uruguayan Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uruguay-high-court-annuls-dictatorship-amnesty.php">found the law to be unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2010, AI <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-el-salvador-to.php">urged government officials in El Salvador</a> to repeal a 1993 amnesty law that <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/el-salvador-defends-amnesty-laws.php">prevents any investigation</a> [JURIST reports] into killings committed during the country's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder], including the killing of respected Catholic Archbishop <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4376733.stm">Oscar Romero</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=oscar+romero">news archive</a>].

AG Tom Horne makes several claims in the complaint, including: there is no rational basis behind the powers given to the Federal government over the states, in violation of the 14th and 15th amendment; Arizona is penalized for archaic violations that have been corrected; and the VRA holds states to different standards based on their Hispanic populations without rational justification.<blockquote>In 1974, Arizona became only the second state in the nation to popularly elect a Hispanic governor. There was no reason in 1975 to subject Arizona to the extraordinary burden of seeking approval from the Department of Justice for changes to its laws in 1975, and there certainly is no rationale to continue the practice today. As Congress recognized, despite reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act in 2006, "significant progress" has been made in addressing the concerns that originally justified the VRA. Congress noted "increased numbers of registered minority voters, minority voter turnout, and minority representation."</blockquote>US Attorney General Eric Holder responded that he will <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/August/11-ag-1090.html">defend against the challenge</a> [press release]: "The Voting Rights Act plays a vital role in our society by ensuring that every American has the right to vote and to have that vote counted."

<p>The VRA was enacted to put an end to the systematic disenfranchisement of minority voters that ran rampant in Southern districts in the 1960s. Although the Senate extended the act an additional 25 years by an overwhelming 98-0 vote in 2006, its basis in a legacy of discrimination evidenced more than 45 years ago has gone largely unexamined.  There have been several challenges to the VRA, and it has consistently been upheld as constitutional. A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/federal-court-hears-new-voting-rights-act-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in February on a similar challenge to the VRA. Officials representing Shelby County, Alabama, together with a corps of conservative activists, argued that it is no longer constitutionally justifiable to subject Alabama and certain other states to Section 5 pre-clearance rules under the VRA. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-322.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-upholds-voting-rights-act.php">report</a>] a controversial provision of the VRA last year in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-322">Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The court voted 8-1 in favor of permitting the appellant municipality to "bail out" from the Section 5 pre-clearance requirement if it can establish a history of compliance with the VRA, but declined to rule on the constitutionality of the 25-year extension of the act. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts opined that "things have changed in the South," observing that "[b]latantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare." The plaintiff was a municipal utility district in Texas that wanted to be exempted from the requirement and was challenging the most recent extension generally. At their enactment in 1965, the requirements were only supposed to be in place for five years. Section 5 has since been extended several times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed amendment, to take effect in 2020, will prohibit <a href="http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/08/25/actualidad/1314307263_984459.html">Spain's national deficit from surpassing more than 0.4 percent</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). The law requires that Spain maintain a budget that will remain within the deficit margins established by the EU. The benefits of the changes, developed as a direct attack against Spain's struggles during the last two years of the recession, were described by the parties as guaranteed fiscal responsibility, a revitalized economy and a sustained public welfare system. Although the proposed law does not specify definite limits, the government will only be able to exceed the national budget in times of natural catastrophes, national emergencies and another economic recession. Parliament is expected to vote on the amendment on September 2. The actual law is expected to be passed by July 2012. 

<p>A fear of a bailout has caused several European nations to make moves to avoid a major debt crisis. Italy and Spain succeeded in lowering its borrowing costs by <a href="http://www.chron.com/business/article/Italian-borrowing-costs-slide-2142237.php">taking advantage of a European bond-buying</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> report] program.

The caucus, comprised of Democrats in the state Senate, argued that the law, which will require South Carolina residents to present a current government-issued ID, is too restrictive and may <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/article/SC-Senate-Democrats-formally-protest-voter-ID-law-2142685.php">disenfranchise African Americans and elderly voters</a> [AP report]. The objection follows earlier <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-voter-id-law-challenged.php">attempts by several South Carolina civil rights groups</a> [JURIST report] to prevent the law from being implemented. They allege that the new law is stricter than other state voter ID laws because a voter must have both a valid and current form of identification. Critics of the law believe that those with suspended or revoked licenses <a href="http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/08/26/2352983/sc-dems-seek-end-to-voter-id-law.html">will potentially lose the chance to vote</a> [<em>Sun News</em> report] because they do not have any other form of identification. Additionally, opponents argue that this law targets elderly and African American voters who are also without these forms of identification. The Democratic caucus suggests the law specifically targets African American voters because it was introduced after 2008 <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/26/AR2008012602741.html">when African Americans voted in equal percentages</a> [WP report] as whites in the South Carolina Democratic primary. Supporters of the law argue it is a measure against voter fraud. The DOJ, which must approve the law before it can take effect under the <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act</a> [materials], is expected to make a ruling on the law's validity within the next week. 

<p>There are now 30 US states that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 14 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In June, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would have required individuals to present government-issued photo ID at the voting booth. In May, the Georgia Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld a state law</a> [JURIST report] that requires voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Among other issues, Judge Carl Barbier <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/OilSpill/Orders/8262011Order(MotionToDismissB1Complaint).pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that all state law claims in the case are preempted by federal maritime law and should be dismissed, but that the same general maritime law makes punitive damages available. Since admiralty jurisdiction is present is the case, it requires application of substantive maritime law. BP and the other companies claimed the US <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/lawsregs/opaover.htm">Oil Pollution Act</a> (OPA) [EPA backgrounder] intervenes, and its silence on punitive damages should prevent plaintiffs from any such collection. Judge Barbier disagreed:<blockquote>OPA does not mention punitive damages; thus, while punitive damages are not available under OPA, the Court does not read OPA&#8217;s silence as meaning that punitive damages are precluded under general maritime law. Congress knows how to proscribe punitive damages when it intends to... Thus, OPA does not displace general maritime law claims for those Plaintiffs who would have been able to bring such claims prior to OPA's enactment. These Plaintiffs assert plausible claims for punitive damages against Responsible and non-Responsible parties.</blockquote> Judge Barbier also ruled that owners of boats damaged during cleanup efforts may proceed under federal oil pollution law, as may corporate claims over lost revenue due to the subsequent government moratorium on deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Dismissed claims for economic loss brought by individuals and businesses under state law still may be pursued under federal maritime and environmental laws.

<p>Last month Judge Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-dismisses-bp-oil-spill-fraud-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] consolidated racketeering claims against BP in connection with the spill brought under the US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [text]. In February, Mississippi <a href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us/">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] asked the district court to order the <a href="http://www.gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/index">Gulf Coast Claims Facility</a> (GCCF) [official website] to fulfill its legal obligations to aid victims of the spill and to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/mississippi-ag-seeks-to-remedy-deficiencies-of-bp-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">remedy inadequate claims mechanisms</a> [JURIST report]. The GCCF <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/independent-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund-begins-processing-claims.php">began processing claims</a> in August following the completion of <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">negotiations</a> [JURIST reports] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. Former Alabama Attorney General Troy King <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/alabama-ag-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in August of last year against BP for damages to the state's coast and economy, claiming that the oil giant has failed in its efforts to accept responsibility for the oil spill. In July 2010, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bp-facing-lawsuit-over-handling-of-oil-spill-cleanup.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed against the company in a Louisiana state court alleging that its negligent actions led to the spill and that BP was further negligent in its oversight of the cleanup effort, resulting in volunteers falling ill due to inadequate protective equipment. One month prior, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that the DOJ would review whether any criminal or civil <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/doj-to-initiate-criminal-probe-of-bp-gulf-oil-spill.php">laws were violated</a> [JURIST report] by BP. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Organization/node_2847.htm">Standing Committee</a> [official website] of the NPC adopted an interpretation that "stipulates that Hong's Kong's laws concerning rules on state immunity must be 'consistent with the rules or policies on state immunity that the central government has adopted.'" Unlike much of the world's nations, China <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-08/26/c_131077600.htm">recognizes absolute sovereign immunity</a> [Xinhua report] in its courts, even in cases purely involved with business dealings. The official interpretation passed on the last day of the three-day bi-monthly session of the NPC Standing Committee, and was derived from a 2008 lawsuit filed in a Hong Kong high court. US-registered FG Hemisphere Associates LLC had named the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a defendant in its legal proceedings in the court, and the country claimed that Hong Kong courts do not have jurisdiction over Congo as a sovereign nation. In June 2011, the <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.hk/en/crt_services/pphlt/html/cfa.htm">Hong Kong Court of Final Appeals</a> [official website] made a provisional judgment, stating that Hong Kong should follow the rules on state immunity that the central government has adopted, granting Congo its claimed immunity from jurisdiction. However, because the central government has the final say on Hong Kong issues relating to foreign affairs, the Court of Final Appeals believed it needed to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/beijing-confirms-hong-kong-court-ruling-blocking-fund-from-suing-congo-over-debts/2011/08/26/gIQAQ82efJ_story.html">seek an interpretation from the legislature</a> [WP report] before issuing its final judgment. The NPC Standing Committee Legislative Affairs Commission largely adopted the court's ruling, and the court will now make its final judgment on the basis of its decision.

<p>FG Hemisphere Associates has sued Congo and certain corporations in courts in several nations around the world. The company is attempting to recover over $100 million owed for a series of power stations built in the 1980s. The US does not recognize sovereign immunity for foreign nations in all cases involving business transactions. In March, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/CB6669A3D6EDA9EC85257854004F9CFA/$file/10-7040-1298140.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Congo's appeal from a district court decision in FG Hemisphere Associates' favor, which the appellate court affirmed. US courts often deny sovereign immunity. In February, a federal judge ruled that former Somali prime minister and defense minister Mohamed Ali Samantar was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-denies-immunity-to-former-somalia-pm.php">not entitled to immunity from civil lawsuits</a> [JURIST report]. Samantar, who had lived in the greater Washington, DC, area for more than 15 years, was sued in 2004 by two Somali men who alleged he spearheaded a campaign of ethnic repression against the northern Somali Isaaq clan during his tenure in office. Immunity was also <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/federal-judge-rules-clergy-abuse.php">denied in a clergy abuse case against the Vatican</a> [JURIST report] in January.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case stems from a 2007 incident, when police officers arrested Simon Gilk after he openly recorded three police officers arresting a suspect on the Boston Common. Circuit Judge Kermit Lipez, speaking for the unanimous three-judge panel, rejected the officers claim that they had qualified immunity since the law regarding recordings of police action is not well-settled. The opinion recognized that the undoubted right to gather news from any source, by means within the law, is an important corollary to the First Amendment saying: <blockquote>The First Amendment issue here is, as the parties frame it, fairly narrow: is there a constitutionally protected right to videotape police carrying out their duties in public? Basic First Amendment principles, along with case law from this and other circuits, answer that question unambiguously in the affirmative. It is firmly established that the First Amendment's aegis extends further than the text's proscription on laws "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," and encompasses a range of conduct related to the gathering and dissemination of 
information. ... The filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public place, including police officers performing their responsibilities, fits comfortably within these principles. Gathering information about government officials in a form that can readily be disseminated to others serves a cardinal First Amendment interest in protecting and promoting "the free discussion of governmental affairs.</blockquote> Lipez cited well established case law and stressed that the right to gather news is not one that inures solely to the benefit of the news media but also extends to a private individual. 
 The Court recognized that the right to record is not without limitations and is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] filed an <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/CCR%20Amicus%20Brief_0.pdf"><em>amicus</em> brief</a> [PDF] arguing that concerned individuals and Copwatch groups have a right to record the activity of police in the public.

<p>The police officers arrested Gilk and charged him with violating of the wiretap statute, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. The Commonwealth dropped the last charge recognizing that they did not have probable cause.  The other two charges against Gilk were also dismissed by a Boston Municipal Court. In February 2010, Gilk filed a complaint under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.shtml">42 USC &#167; 1983</a> [text] for violation of Gilk's First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights. The officers appealed to the First Circuit court after the district court denied the officers motion to dismiss the case because the officers had qualified immunity.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled that the statute implicated the First Amendment rights of teachers and described the breadth of prohibition as "staggering." The Court found that social networking is used extensively by teachers, and often is the primary if not the sole medium of communication between teachers and students or parents. The Court concluded that the chilling effect the statute would have on speech and that public interest is best served by allowing a trial and ruling on the merits before the statute is implemented. The <a href="http://www.msta.org/">Missouri State Teachers Association</a> (MTSA) [official website] expressed their approval of the injunction citing that the injunction "gives everyone time to debate and discuss the issue to come to a proper resolution rather than rushing to piece together language that doesn't resolve the concerns of educators or allow time for teacher input." Meanwhile, <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/newsroom/2011/Gov_Nixon_to_ask_General_Assembly_to_repeal_provision_of_SB_54_on_teacher_student_communication">announced</a> [press release] plans on Friday to ask the General Assembly to repeal statute 162.069, sections 1 through 4, due to substantial confusion among teachers, students and families. The injunction is set to expire on February 20, 2012. 

<p>The social media law is a part of Senate Bill 54, also known as <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/11info/BTS_Web/BillText.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=4066479">Amy Hestir Student Protection Act</a> [materials].  The bill passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate during the regular legislative session. MTSA filed an action on August 19 opposing the prohibition of social media because it would inhibit the ability of the teachers to communicate with students through social media sites such as Facebook and through text messaging. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Claims made in a <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Mainf.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta11/ERES1782.htm">report</a> [text] authored by <a href="http://www.coe.int/lportal/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] member <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4526418.stm">Dick Marty</a> [BBC profile] indicate that Thaci served as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-weighs-kosovo-organ-trafficking-investigation.php">"boss" of an illegal criminal enterprise</a> [JURIST report] that trafficked human organs and drugs during the war. Though Thaci strongly denies the allegations and has pledged to cooperate with the investigation, the report was based on a two-year investigation that concluded that <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kla.htm">Kosovo Liberation Arm</a> (ALK) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] soldiers, lead by Thaci, ran detention centers where civilians were killed and their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12309869">organs sold on the black market</a> [BBC report].

<p>The COE report alleges that Thaci was the leader of the KLA Drenica Group, a criminal network that controlled the heroin trade and the black market trafficking of kidneys of executed Serbian and Albanian war prisoners. News of the report's accusations prompted the government to <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,1782">respond</a> [press release], denying the allegations and calling them an attempt to harm Thaci's reputation following his party's victory in the nation's parliamentary elections last year. Claims of Kosovo's involvement in human organ trafficking originated in 2008 when former prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1809185.stm">Carla Del Ponte</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=del+ponte">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dnp-del-ponte-book-promotion.php">alleged in a book</a> [JURIST report] about her time at the tribunal that roughly 300 Serbian and other non-Albanian prisoners were victims of organ trafficking during the war. That year, Serbian prosecutors condemned Albania's <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/albania-prosecutor-refuses-to.php">refusal to initiate</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into allegations of organ trafficking in Kosovo. Albanian Prosecutor General Ina Rama refused to cooperate with Serbian war crimes <a href="http://www.tuzilastvorz.org.rs/html_trz/index_eng.htm">prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic</a> [official website] and said that her country would only pursue the allegations if the ICTY decided to reopen its investigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a nationally televised <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/470324">speech</a> [video], Khalifa conceded that some of the protesters had been subjected to violence during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bahrain">demonstrations which began in February</a> [JURIST news archive]. Khalifa said:<blockquote>There are those who were arrested, and investigations proved that they were the victims of individual behavior and were ill-treated in custody. This is not tolerated by God and we do not condone it. ... The last few months were painful for all of us, and even though we all live in the same country, some have forgotten about the inevitability of coexistence.</blockquote>Khalifa also announced that victims of abuse or the families of those killed during the protests will be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i1O7dxBnk1-vY0WFZ7P9EUo-9Pbw?docId=ca5a672b6fb94996a864eaa92fcf2a77">eligible to receive compensation payments</a> [AP report]. The Bahraini Supreme Court will oversee the disbursement of compensation payments to victims. 

<p>In June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the OHCHR announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. In April, human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized Bahrain for rampant human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] related to anti-government protests. Six <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">opposition leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] in March after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in the capital of Manana. Days earlier, Khalifa <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">three-month state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">called on the King to impose martial law</a> [JURIST report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. In February, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Though the pardoning of "repentant" prisoners traditionally coincides with the conclusion of Ramadan, analysts have viewed their release as a political, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/28/world/la-fg-iran-protests-pardons-20110829">conciliatory gesture</a> [LAT report]  in preparation for next year's elections. Because the names of the prisoners have not been released, it is unclear whether two Americans <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/08/28/iran.us.hikers/index.html?iref=allsearch">captured while hiking across the border of Iraq</a> [CNN report] are among those who have been freed. 

<p>The Iranian government has faced significant international scrutiny for its handling of the post-election protests and treatment of thousands arrested as a result. Aside from the repeated pleas form the US, Amnesty International labeled human rights violations committed by the Iranian government following the election <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/iran-post-election-rights-abuses-worst.php">among the worst of the past 20 years</a> [JURIST report].

The ceremony was attended by <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] who <a href="http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=72124">emphasized the importance</a> [KBC report] of the appointments to the country's ongoing institutional reform. "With all these reforms that we are implementing now, I am quite sure that the country will make good progress," Kibaki told those in attendance. The newly appointed Supreme Court judges are Chief Justice Willy Mutunga, Deputy Chief Nancy Baraza, Phillip Tunoi, Jackton Ojwang, Mohamed Ibrahim, Charles Wanjala and Njoki Ndung'u. The appointments come just one day after the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/judiciary/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=288&Itemid=327">High Court of Nairobi</a> [official website] dismissed a claim that the nomination of only one female judge to the Supreme Court violates the <a href="http://www.kenyalaw.org/klr/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Constitution_of_Kenya__2010.pdf">Kenyan Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. The claim was brought by the <a href="http://fidakenya.org/">Federation of Women Lawyers</a> (FIDA) Kenya [official website] and other advocacy groups which argued that the appointments would violate Article 27, which requires that no more than two-thirds of a public body be comprised of one gender. The court refused to grant a temporary injunction that would bar the appointment of the justices pending an appeal by FIDA, paving the way for Friday's ceremony. 

<p>In June, the <a href="http://www.gjlos.go.ke/gjinner.asp?pcat2=agencies&pcat=judiciary&cat=judicialserv">Judicial Service Commission</a> (JSC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/kenya-selects-5-appointees-to-serve-on-first-supreme-court.php">selected five appointees</a> [JURIST report], one woman and four men, to serve on the nation's first Supreme Court. The list of nominations was submitted to Kibaki for direct appointment because Article 166(1)(b) of Kenya's Constitution exempts the appointees from questioning by the <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ke/">Parliament of the Republic of Kenya</a> [official website]. Kibaki <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">signed a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] into law in August 2010 as part of a reform movement aimed at curbing vast presidential powers. Kenya's new constitution includes numerous checks on presidential authority, among which are the creation of a supreme court and senate. The new constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/opponents-of-kenya-constitution-concede-in-referendum.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by popular referendum earlier that same month. The creation of a new constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kenya-president-opposition-reach.php">part of a power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] reached in 2009 between Kibaki and opposition leader <a href="http://www.primeminister.go.ke/index.cfm">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [official website] that brought to an end the civil unrest that followed the contested election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Information Minister Adnan Mahmoud indicated the law will "cancel penalties against journalists and ... [facilitate] their access to information." The law also calls for the establishment of a "National Council of Information" linked to the cabinet which will regulate the information sector under the new media law. The law, however, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/08/28/syria.unrest/">bans publications on a swath of topics</a> [CNN report] including content that "affects national unity and national security, incites sectarian strife, incites crimes or hatred, or harms state symbols" as well as news related to the armed forces. Journalists may still be fined up to $21,000 for defamation, and the law would extend accountability for violations to editors, journalists and even media spokespersons. Opposition activists have also dismissed the once highly-sought reforms as "too little too late" in the face of continuing accounts of regime brutality and protester fatalities.

<p>In June, the director-general of the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/">UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) [official website] <a href="http://www.bokova.eu/">Irina Bokova</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-urges-syria-to-grant-freedom-of-expression-to-citizens-journalists.php">condemned Syria</a> [JURIST report] for its human rights violations and repression of journalism and free speech. Bokova called for the government to restore citizens' access to cell phones and the Internet and to stop "acts of aggression" against journalists. Last week, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] adopted a <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/specialsession/17/Draft_resolution_tabled17August2011.pdf">resolution</a> [draft text, PDF] ordering an investigation into crimes against humanity in Syria and urging the Syrian government once again to halt its violent crackdown against peaceful protesters. The UNHRC convened a special session to discuss the possibility of an investigation after a Fact-finding Mission in Syria published a 22-page report concluding that Syrian government forces cracking down on the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, the court ruled last Thursday that the legislature and former governor Jennifer Granholm lacked the authority to side-step the Civil Service Commission.  Explaining the balance of power between the commission and the legislature, the court noted:<blockquote>Although the commission has plenary authority over the rates of compensation, a system of checks and balances was established with the Legislature in the Michigan Constitution of 1963. Specifically, an increase in the rate of compensation authorized by the commission may be rejected or reduced by the Legislature "by a two-thirds vote of the members elected to and serving in each house" provided the vote occurs within 60 calendar days of the transmitted increase."The [L]egislature may not reduce rates of compensation below those in  effect at the time of the transmission of increases authorized by the commission." The Civil Service Commission has the sole authority to fix rates of compensation. By enacting 2010 PA 185 ... the Legislature acted to reduce the compensation of classified civil servants by three percent without an accompanying agreement with the unions or the CSC. The sole authority to fix rates of compensation of classified civil servants is vested with the CSC.</blockquote>The state employees' triumph at the court of appeals may be short-lived as the Michigan Supreme Court may not follow the appeals court's reasoning and, ultimately, the <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110827/NEWS06/108270365/Mich-court-3-pay-cut-state-workers-illegal">retirement health care system remains fiscally unsustainable</a> [<em>Detroit Free Press</em> report]. Current Governor Rick Snyder has not indicated whether it will appeal the ruling.

<p>States facing monumental budget deficits have struggled to find the political consensus to reduce spending. In June, the <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">upheld the Budget Repair Bill</a> [JURIST report] overruling the Dane County Circuit Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">finding</a> [JURIST report] that legislators had violated the "open meetings" rule. Ruling 4-3, the court stated that the lower court Judge had "invaded the legislature's constitutional powers." The more controversial legislation in Wisconsin requires state employees to contribute a percentage of their salaries to their pension and health care premiums, and eliminates the ability of public employee union members to collectively negotiate anything but wage increase, which will be capped by the Consumer Price Index.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"The court will issue detailed Memorandum Opinions and Orders ruling on the merits of the pending Motions for Preliminary Injunction no later than September 28, 2011," Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn wrote in the two-page order. Advocacy groups like the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-seek-to-bar-alabama-immigration-law.php">pushing for the court to block</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">law</a> [HB 56 text], which permits police officers to detain a person stopped for a traffic violation if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the country illegally. The officer must then try to determine the individual's identity by checking other records if the motorist is unable to provide documentation. The bill also requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. The ACLU has argued that the law will cause unlawful racial profiling.

<p>In June, the ACLU, the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy website] and a coalition of other civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">filed a class action</a> lawsuit challenging a similar Georgia immigration law, which has also been <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-blocks-georgia-immigration-law.php">blocked by a judge</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">upheld an Arizona employment law</a> [JURIST report] that imposes penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants, ruling that the law is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text]. The ruling opens the door for states to enact similar restraints on immigration. Several other states have also <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed</a> [JURIST reports] tough new immigration laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A team of PHR investigators conducted several weeks of interviews in Libya, shortly after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and his loyalists were expelled from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-08-16/misrata-relaxes-as-libyan-rebels-advance-against-qaddafi-forces.html">Misrata</a> [Bloomberg report]. The report also reflects troops' pattern of torturing, forcibly disappearing, hostage-taking, detaining, beating and slaying Libyan civilians. PHR made several recommendations for Libya's future:<blockquote>It is critical that civilian authorities led by the TNC [Transitional National Council] assert full control over Libya and establish the rule of law to prevent further bloodshed, vigilante justice, looting, and violence. The international community must assist the newly emerging civilian authorities in providing basic services to the Libyan people as Libya develops a constitutional framework and mechanisms and builds civil society and institutions. ... This effort must also examine reports of human rights violations committed by rebel forces and NATO. In the current absence of developed legal institutions, it is crucial that Libyan transitional authorities fully collaborate with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has already issued arrest warrants for [Gaddafi] and others. ... Prosecutions, vetting, and other necessary methods of accountability will guide the Libyan people as they choose how best to forge a secure and just social and political order in the aftermath of conflict.</blockquote>PHR specifically stated that the report does not "present evidence that either confirms or denies whether rebel and NATO forces may have committed war crimes."  An investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">NATO's alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] is pending.  

<p>Gaddafi continues to disregard <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] issued in May by <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website].

Researchers from the two advocacy groups visited the Nuba Mountain region of South Kordofan where they "documented 13 separate bombing incidents in Kauda, Delami and Kurchi towns alone, in which at least 26 civilians were killed and more than 45 others injured since mid-June." The researchers claim bombings occurred on a continuous basis during their time in the region. They argue that the use of unguided bombs dropped from high altitude on nonmilitary targets is a violation of international human rights law. Amnesty International's Erwin van der Borght called for the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to "condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing human rights violations in the Nuba Mountains, and mandate an independent inquiry to investigate abuses committed by parties to the conflict in Southern Kordofan since 5 June."

<p>The UN Security Council last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-calls-for-end-to-fighting-in-disputed-sudan-kordofan-region.php">called for an end to fighting</a> [JURIST report] in South Kordofan. South Kordofan, which has been held by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) since the 2005 peace deal that stifled Sudan's civil war, is a state in the center of Sudan, and has been a disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan due to its oil reserves. Sudan's army, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), took over Abyei, a district in the state, in May, causing a rebuke and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-security-council-demands-removal-of-sudan-troops-from-disputed-region.php">demand for withdrawal</a> [JURIST report] by the UN. The UN confirmed reports of bombing and shelling in and around Abyei by the SAF, as well as widespread looting and burning of houses. Aid workers estimate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13549157">40,000 people have fled the area</a> [BBC report]. While the UN has said that attacks on its peacekeepers amount to war crimes under international law, both the UN and the US have called on the northern troops to withdraw from Abyei. From the northern capital of Khartoum <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bashir">news archive</a>] has stated he will not withdraw troops from the region and insisted that the area belongs to the north. An <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court </a>(ICC) [official website] case is open against al-Bashir and several nations have been urged to arrest him on sight including: <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/china-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">China</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/malaysia-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">Malaysia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">Djibouti</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">Kenya </a>and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-al-bashir-will-be-arrested.php">Chad </a>[JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Enforced disappearances refers to the practice of placing people in secret detentions for weeks or months without ever being brought before a judge. Some victims of the practice say they were tortured during their detainment. The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/disappear/index.htm">Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances</a> [official website] called the practice "very worrisome," and stated that "whether it is used to counter terrorism, to fight organized crime or suppress legitimate civil strife demanding democracy, freedom of expression or religion, should be considered as an enforced disappearance and as such adequately investigated, prosecuted and punished." The release of the statement marks the first <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/gashc3999.doc.htm">UN International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances</a> [press release], a day devoted to awareness of the crime of enforced disappearances and dedicated to the victims and their families. The UN urged all states to translate and disseminate the <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/h4dpaped.htm">Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance</a> [text] which was adopted by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] two decades ago.

<p>The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has called on other nations to end the practice of enforced disappearances. In June, they <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-demands-china-report-on-missing-persons.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] China <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11122&LangID=E">address its practice of "enforced disappearances"</a> [press release] and reveal the location of 355 detained Tibetan monks. That same month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/libya-opposition-forces-committing-arbitrary-detention-torture-hrw.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the arrest and arbitrary detention of dozens of civilians by Libyan opposition authorities. A three-person commission for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] appointed to investigate violence in Libya published a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.44_AUV.pdf">report</a> [PDF] saying that <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">government forces have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes</a> [JURIST report] under orders from Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], including imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearing will determine whether the defendants are well enough to stand trial. The hearing commenced with two aging defendants who are among the four surviving senior Khmer Rouge officials facing the ECCC for crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge's reign between 1975 and 1979. Charges include genocide, murder, torture, religious persecution and other crimes against humanity. According to the ECCC, at least 1.7 million people died under the Khmer Rouge's leadership due to torture, starvation and execution. The Trial Chamber's substantial hearing to examine evidence and witnesses is anticipated to begin by early next year.

<p>Earlier this month, judges for the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-judges-have-doubts-about-suspects-responsibility.php">announced</a> [JURIST archive] that they had "serious doubts" that the suspects being investigated by the court are those "most responsible" for the for alleged war crimes. The tribunal is responsible for investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Cambodia's communist Khmer Rouge regime of the 1970s. In June, the ECCC began the initial hearings in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-begins-trial-of-former-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">trial of four former Khmer Rouge leaders</a> [JURIST report] constituting <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/2">Case 002</a> [materials].

The Kenyan government <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/kenya-appeals-icc-decision-on-jurisdiction-for-post-election-violence-cases.php">appealed the previous decision</a> in June after the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/kenya-to-appeal-icc-decision-on-jurisdiction-for-post-election-violence-cases.php">announced that they were denying</a> [JURIST reports] Kenya's request to transfer the cases. The presiding judge denied the appeal stating that the Pre-Trial Chamber ruling contained no legal, factual or procedural errors. The Appeals Chamber also indicated that the Pre-Trial Chamber did not err when they found that there was insufficient evidence to support claims by the Kenyan government that they were actively prosecuting the accused defendants. The judge noted that in order for the ICC to lack jurisdiction a member nation must be conducting an investigation covering the same individuals and substantially the same issues as alleged before the ICC, and because no such investigation has been proven by the Kenyan government, the ICC's jurisdiction is valid. The men facing charges in front of the ICC are part of the "Ocampo Six," and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-deny-charges-of-ethnic-killings.php">are facing trial</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly inciting violence during and after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kenya+2007+election">December 2007 Kenyan elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. The ICC initially claimed jurisdiction due to doubts that Kenya was willing to fully investigate the matter. The 2007 Kenyan post-election violence resulted in more than 1,100 deaths, 3,500 injuries, hundreds of rapes and up to 600,000 individuals being forcibly displaced.

<p>The Ocampo Six include several high-ranking members of Kenya's government, the head of operations at <a href="http://www.kassfm.co.ke/">Kass FM</a> [official website] in Nairobi and the son of Kenya's first president, <a href="http://www.africawithin.com/bios/jomo_kenyatta.htm">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [Africa Within backgrounder]. Three of the men are members of the <a href="http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website], and the other three are members of the opposing Party for National Unity (PNU). The ODM suspects are charged with fomenting violence against PNU members following the 2007 elections because they believed the election of Kenyan <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] to be rigged. In response, the PNU suspects are charged with the conspiring with the <a href="http://www.saferaccess.org/documents/The%20Mungiki%20-%20Cult%20Street%20Gang%20or%20Political%20Force.pdf">Mungiki criminal organization</a> [Safer Access backgrounder, PDF] to attack members of the ODM party. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summoned the suspects</a> [JURIST report] after determining they would not be charged in Kenya for the alleged crimes. In April, Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requested that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the government is capable of prosecuting the six men domestically. Lawyers for the Ocampo Six called for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-ask-for-evidence-from-icc-prosecutor.php">timely release of evidence</a> [JURIST report] against their clients that month as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although none of the high profile government dissidents was released, the president <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/vietnam-free-more-10-000-prisoners-054425430.html">freed five individuals</a> [AP report] convicted of national security crimes. Eleven of the prisoners released are foreigners from countries including the US, Canada and Australia. The <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/lite/news/254128/vietnam-pardons-10000-prisoners-few-dissidents">amnesty</a> [AFP report] is an event celebrated annually on National Day, September 2, which marks the day that Vietnam declared its independence from France.  The individuals released were arrested for a broad range of different crimes. Vietnam has been criticized by the US, the EU and various human rights groups for jailing government dissidents.

<p>The release of prisoners comes after many controversial arrests were made by Vietnam's communist government. In April, well-known lawyer and activist Cu Huy Ha Vu was among several dissidents in Vietnam <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/vietnam-rights-lawyer-jailed-after-calling-for-government-reform.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] for anti-government activity. In January 2010, four defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of activities aimed at ending communist rule in Vietnam. In March, 2010 Vietnamese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/vietnam-authorities-release-dissident.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a Catholic priest and leading rights activist from Hanoi prison. Also in March, Vietnamese human rights lawyer and activist Le Thi Cong Nhan was <a href="man-rights-lawyer-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from prison after serving a three-year sentence for allegedly spreading propaganda against the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontinfant.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/11/08/101092P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that an Iowa girl born two years after her father's death was not entitled to his <A href = "http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security</a> [official website] benefits. After the death of her husband, Patti Beeler used <a href = "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007279.htm">in vitro fertilization</a> (IVF) [Medline backgrounder] to conceive the child, known as BEB, with her late husband's preserved semen. She then applied to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for survivor's benefits but was denied when the SSA said BEB did not qualify under sections <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/socsec/act/0202.htm">402(d)(1)</a> and <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/socsec/act/0216.htm">416(e)</a> of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/socsec/act/0200.htm">Social Security Act</a> [texts]. The first section only distributes benefits to children who were "dependent upon such individual ... at the time of such death," while the second defines child. A lower court ruled for Beeler, but Monday's decision reversed, finding the SSA made a reasonable interpretation of the act:<blockquote>The death of Bruce Beeler at a relatively young age before he and Patti Beeler could conceive children is profoundly sad. But whether the granting of child's insurance benefits to B.E.B., a posthumously conceived child, would further the purposes of the Social Security Act is debatable, given the Act's "basic aim of primarily helping those children who lost support after the unanticipated death of a parent." It is unlikely that Members of Congress contemplated this precise question when enacting the relevant provisions of the Act in the 1930s and 1960s. At a minimum, however, the Act permits the longstanding position of the SSA, if the Act does not require it. As the law now stands, it resolves the question of eligibility for child's insurance benefits by reference to state intestacy law, and Iowa law did not provide B.E.B. with intestacy rights at the time of the agency's final decision in this litigation.</blockquote>The Beelers' home state of Iowa's intestacy law was written before IVF was prevalent and did not allow for IVF children to have rights of inheritance. Since this case, Iowa has enacted <a href = "http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/govbills/HF245.pdf">HF 245</a> [text, PDF], which guarantees estate rights to IVF children. Both the <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth</a> and <a href = "http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">Third Circuits</a> [official websites] have ruled that the SSA is misinterpreting the statute and have awarded benefits to IVF children, so the issue will likely culminate in the Supreme Court.

<p>IVF is a type of fertility treatment for couples who have had difficulty conceiving children. Through IVF, a woman's eggs are removed and fertilized outside the body. Successfully fertilized embryos are then implanted into the woman for gestation. Although it is becoming a widely accepted practice, many nations have had difficulty fitting this approach to conception into their legal structures. The <a href = "http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] in August <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/rights-group-sues-costa-rica-for-failure-to-legalize-in-vitro-fertilization.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href = "http://www.corteidh.or.cr/">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> [official website, in Spanish] to challenge Costa Rica's longstanding ban on IVF. The Grand Chamber of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] in Strasbourg ruled in 2007 that a British woman could not have <a href = "/paperchase/2007/04/europe-rights-court-rules-uk-woman.php">frozen embryos conceived with a former partner implanted without his consent</a> [JURIST report]. Natallie Evans and Howard Johnston entered an IVF program in 2001 and Johnson agreed to the implantation of the embryos, but later withdrew his consent after the breakup of the couple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The military officials received sentences of 10&#8211;15 years while the former cabinet ministers received three-year sentences for complicity in the murders. The convicted leaders are <a href = "http://www.laprensa.com.bo/diario/actualidad/bolivia/20110831/sentencias-de-hasta-15-anos-para-exmilitares_5097_8924.html">not permitted an appeal</a> [<em>La Prensa</em> report, in Spanish]. One commander of the army, Juan Veliz Herrera, <a href = "http://www.la-razon.com/version.php?ArticleId=136621&EditionId=2637">pleaded innocence</a> [<em>La Razon</em> report, in Spanish] and suggested he was being persecuted for having different political views than the current government and non-governmental organizations. Trials for the genocide began in 2009, when the court <a href = "/paperchase/2009/05/bolivia-ex-president-goes-on-trial-in.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former president Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in connection with the deaths of 63 anti-government protesters in October 2003, now commonly known as "Black October." Sanchez de Lozada and 17 other former government officials face genocide charges related to incident, for which he faces 30 years in prison if convicted.

<p>Bolivian officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/bolivia-officials-request-extradition.php">requested extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Sanchez de Lozada and two other defendants from the US to face trial under a 1995 extradition treaty. A defense lawyer for victims' families made <a href = "http://www.la-razon.com/version.php?ArticleId=136620&EditionId=2637">another plea for extradition</a> [<em>La Razon</em> report, in Spanish] after Tuesday's convictions. However, the US has consistently refused to extradite Sanchez de Lozada, and his lawyers reports he resides in the US legally and maintains the prosecutions are political. The 2003 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3202216.stm">riots</a> [BBC report] occurred when military forces clashed with predominantly indigenous farmers, coca growers, students and unionists who protested Sanchez de Lozada's attempts to open up the country to free trade with the US and to export gas and other natural resources. The protests were led by his former political rival and current Bolivian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3203752.stm">President Evo Morales</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morales">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">challenge to the law</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of a class of physicians that perform abortions. The <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/HB00015E.pdf#navpanes=0">law</a> [HB 15 text] at issue created various prerequisites that a woman must meet to establish informed and voluntary consent to an abortion. For example, a physician must perform a sonogram, show the images to the woman and explain them. In addition, a physician must play the sounds of the heartbeat to the woman. The court, holding that the provisions requiring physicians to provide, and women to hear, descriptions of the sonogram violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text], granted in part the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Addressing the First Amendment violation, Judge Sam Sparks wrote: <blockquote>The net result of these provisions is: (1) a physician is required to say things and take expressive actions with which the physician may not ideologically agree, and which the physician may feel are medically unnecessary; (2) the pregnant woman must not only passively receive this potentially unwanted speech and expression, but must also actively participate;in the best case by simply signing an election form, and in the worst case by disclosing in writing extremely personal, medically irrelevant facts; and (3) the entire experience must be memorialized in records that are, at best, semi-private. In the absence of a sufficiently weighty government interest, and a sufficiently narrow statute advancing that interest, neither of which have been argued by Defendants, the Constitution does not permit such compulsion.</blockquote> Additionally, the court found three sections of the law to be unconstitutionally vague and severed those from the Act for enforcement purposes. The remaining provisions of the law are set to take effect on Thursday.

<p>Texas is only one of many states that have recently enacted, and subsequently had to defend, laws restricting abortions. With courts analyzing these cases differently, the outcomes have varied. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.apltwo.ct.state.az.us/">Arizona Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-court-lifts-injunction-on-2009-abortion-law.php">ended a two-year injunction</a> [JURIST report] on portions of a law that restricted abortion practices. The original injunction by the <a href="http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/">Maricopa County Superior Court</a> [official website] held the following provisions as "undue burdens" on a woman's right to an abortion: prohibitions on anyone but a licensed physician performing an abortion; a requirement that women meet with the doctor personally 24 hours before an abortion (the injunction held that a phone call would suffice); that medical professionals have a right to refuse to perform even medically necessary abortions, provide certain contraceptives or the "morning after" pill; and a mandate that parents' consent forms allowing their child to get an abortion be notarized. The appeals court reinstated all of these stipulations, suggesting that the lower judge had applied "strict scrutiny" in error rather than an "undue burden" test. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppaz/">Planned Parenthood of Arizona</a> [advocacy website], a party to the original suit, said the law's enactment will have a severe impact on women in the state, many of whom have to take day-trips to have abortions. It is unknown if they will appeal. </p>]]></content:encoded>

All of the victims were detained because of actual or suspected involvement in the protests for reform, most of which have been nonviolent, that began in the country last March. AI alleges that many of these deaths involved "horrific" torture, with detainees often being "slapped, beaten and kicked" by members of the security forces and at times "whipped and beaten with wooden sticks, cables or rifle butts." The report also alleges that only two of the deaths were subject to official investigations as required by international human rights law. As a result of this dramatic increase in deaths while in custody and the circumstances surrounding them, AI considers the actions of the Syrian officials to be crimes against humanity and is calling on the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to condemn the killings and take other measures, including an arms embargo and the freezing of assets of Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. 

<p>The continuing violence against protesters in Syria has not gone unnoticed. Last week, during a special session of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> Navi Pillay [official profile], who noted that more than 2,000 people had been killed since the protests began, including hundreds during the month of Ramadan, urged the Syrian government to stop its indiscriminate attacks on peaceful protesters and to release all persons detained for participating in those protests. During this special session, the UNHRC voted 33-4 to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-council-adopts-syria-probe-resolution.php">adopt a resolution</a> [JURIST report] ordering an investigation into crimes against humanity in Syria and urging the Syrian government once again to halt its violent crackdown against peaceful protesters. The UNHRC began last week's session to discuss the possibility of an investigation after the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] published a 22-page report concluding that Syrian government forces <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. The session was held in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">plea</a> [JURIST report] from Pillay earlier this month to refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for an investigation into the violent suppression of anti-government protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agency <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/August/11-at-1118.html">filed suit</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] and seeks to prevent AT&#38;T from acquiring T-Mobile from parent company <a href="http://www.telekom.com/dtag/cms/content/dt/en/13588">Deutsche Telekom AG</a> [corporate website]. Citing traditional antitrust concerns, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/Justice-ATT-TMobile-Complaint.pdf">DOJ claims</a> [complaint, PDF] that the merger of two of the top four domestic mobile carriers would result in higher prices, fewer choices and poorer quality of services for consumers:<blockquote>Due to the advantages arising from their scale and scope of coverage, each of the Big Four nationwide carriers is especially well-positioned to drive competition, at both a national and local level, in this industry. T-Mobile in particular&#8212;a company with a self-described "challenger brand," that historically has been a value provider, and that even within the past few months had been developing and deploying "disruptive pricing" plans&#8212;places important competitive pressure on its three larger rivals, particularly in terms of pricing, a critically important aspect of competition. AT&#38;T's elimination of T-Mobile as an independent, low-priced rival would remove a significant competitive force from the market.</blockquote>The other "Big Four" carriers are <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/">Verizon Wireless</a>, the nation's largest, and <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/">Sprint Nextel</a> [corporate websites]. The largest recent example of the smaller firms' impact on the industry came in 2010 when AT&#38;T and Verizon significantly <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/10/technology/cell_phone_bill/index.htm?iid=EL">slashed the prices of their unlimited calling plans</a> [CNNMoney report], primarily as a result of aggressive pricing set by T-Mobile and Sprint.

<p>The worldwide consolidation of media is an ongoing global concern. Earlier this month a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-major-publishers-of-collusion.php">class action lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.apple.com/startpage/">Apple</a> [corporate website] and five major publishers for allegedly colluding to illegally fix electronic book (e-book) prices. In a <a href="/hotline/2011/07/dave-saldana-news-corp.php">Hotline article published last month</a> [JURIST comment] Dave Saldana, Communication Director for <a href="http://www.freepress.net/">Free Press</a>, used the proposed AT&#38;T/T-Mobile deal as an example of the enormous influence giant media corporations can bring to bear through massive public relations blitzes and the acquisition of political influence through the pouring of money into lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. As a result of exactly these kinds of efforts, AT&#38;T had remained confident to this point that its T-Mobile purchase would go through, "because it knows it has several hundred million reasons to push for the merger, and millions of means to get it." In that sense antitrust concern regarding media consolidation is doubly founded, because unlike manufacturing or other traditional industry mergers, the resultant titans of media created through already-giant media company mergers not only dominate their own marketplace, but the information market as well, giving them leverage to sway public opinion and dominate the narrative when their own practices are questioned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mother of three Jennie Linn McCormack was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/31/us-abortion-idaho-idUSTRE77U2JP20110831">prosecuted earlier this year</a> [Reuters report] under a 1972 state law that makes it a felony to end one's own pregnancy, and is now challenging both that law and Idaho's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">newly-enacted "fetal pain" anti-abortion statute</a> [JURIST report]. The new law, passed in April, makes it a felony to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks based on controversial science indicating a fetus may feel pain after 20 weeks of development. McCormack discovered she was pregnant in the fall of last year and, using a combination of FDA-approved abortion pills obtained over the Internet in December, terminated her pregnancy at between 20 and 21 weeks of gestation. Because McCormack terminated her pregnancy before the new statute's passage she could not be prosecuted for its violation, and a judge dismissed for lack of evidence the charges brought under the 1972 law. McCormack is now leading a class-action lawsuit to challenge both laws based on the claim that they pose unconstitutional barriers to abortion. Specifically McCormack, who has a monthly income of less than $250, claims that the 1972 law discriminates against women of limited means by forcing them to obtain surgical procedures that are both costly and locally unavailable.

<p>Since the November elections state legislatures across the country have been implementing measures to restrict abortions, and challenges to these laws are appearing in many states. On Tuesday a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-key-provisions-of-texas-abortion-law.php">blocked several provisions of a new Texas abortion law</a> [JURIST report] that places restrictions on the procedure and requires a doctor to show a sonogram to and play the sounds of the fetal heartbeat for a woman prior to performing an abortion. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.apltwo.ct.state.az.us/">Arizona Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-court-lifts-injunction-on-2009-abortion-law.php">ended a two-year injunction</a> [JURIST report] on portions of a law that restricted abortion practices, suggesting that the lower judge had applied "strict scrutiny" in error rather than an "undue burden" test. Also this month the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-challenges-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">filed a lawsuit challenging a Kansas law</a> [JURIST report] that prohibits insurance companies from including coverage for abortion in their comprehensive plans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The country's <a href="http://www.dorh.hr/Default.aspx?sec=18">Bureau for Combating Corruption and Organized Crime</a> (USKOK) [official website, in Croatian] alleges Sanader received a pay-off of more than 3.6 million kuna (nearly USD $695,000) from Austria's <a href="http://www.hypo-alpe-adria.com/115/home.nsf/home/de">Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank</a> [official website, in German] in exchange for the country entering into a loan agreement to receive 140 million Austrian Schillings (USD $14.7 million) in order to place the bank in the Croatian market. The indictment alleges that Sanader made the deal while he was Deputy Minister of Foreign Affrairs between 1994 and 1995. Sanader is charged with violating provisions of the country's <a href="http://www.vsrh.hr/CustomPages/Static/HRV/Files/Legislation__Criminal-Code.pdf">criminal code</a> [text, PDF] regarding abuse of office and official authority, fraud and corruption.

<p>Sanader was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/Austria-extradites-Croatia-ex-PM-to-face-corruption-charges.php">extradited</a> to Croatia in July in order to face these charges after he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">arrested</a> [JURIST reports] in Austria last December. Sanader had begun an appeal, arguing that it would be impossible to receive a fair trail in Croatia, but he <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-ex-pm-drops-extradition-appeal-faces-corruption-charges.php">dropped it after media speculation</a> [JURIST report] suggested the appeal could harm Croatia's accession to the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. In June, the <a href="http://www.european-council.europa.eu/home-page.aspx?lang=en">European Council</a> [official website] agreed to grant Croatia EU membership following six years of accession negotiations. The decision calls for negotiations to close by the end of the month and the accession treaty to be signed by year's end, allowing for the country to become the 28th member of the EU on July 1, 2013. In the interim, EU leaders strongly encouraged Croatia to continue pursuing crucial reform initiatives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/articulo-295860-corte-ordena-captura-de-alberto-santofimio-magnicidio-de-galan">issued an arrest warrant</a> [<em>El Espectador</em> report] for Santofimio, the former justice minister whose conviction and 24-year sentence were overturned by the High Court of Cundinamarca. He is accused of urging drug cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar to kill his political opponent, Galan, suggesting that Galan would crack down on Escobar and the drug trade. Galan was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hiWzK31BFvGOFip-MpxaG3F9Yomg?docId=4152a9e782cd476f99f127965ddbcb70">murdered</a> [AP report] by Escobar's hitmen, one of whom, John Jairo Velasquez, known as "Popeye," was a key witness against Santofimio at his original trial. The court reinstated the conviction after an appeal by Galan's family.

<p>Escobar led the Medellin Cartel drug cartel, which was one of the world's largest suppliers of cocaine. He was killed by police in 1993. Colombia has been struggling with internal violence for decades. In May, the <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/">Colombian Senate</a> [official website, in Spanish] passed a law to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/colombia-senate-passes-victim-compensation-law.php">compensate citizens who have been victimized</a> [JURIST report] by ongoing civil turmoil. The <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/noticias/item/11798-abc-de-la-ley-de-victimas-informe-especial">Victims' Law and Land Restitution Law</a> [backgrounder, in Spanish] will provide financial compensation and restitution of land to victims of internal armed conflicts involving paramilitaries and guerrillas during the past 30 years. Individuals who feel they have been victimized by the conflicts since January 1, 1985, are eligible for financial compensation, and those who have also had their land seized or abandoned their land in the wake of armed conflict are subject to restitution of their land.

EFF argued that the government should not be able block the suits under claims of state secrets. The EFF says that the National Security Agency (NSA) unconstitutionally intercepted phone calls and emails of US citizens by accessing the communication database records from AT&#38;T. It argues that the government has <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/jewel/SchubertReplyBrief.pdf">not proven a necessity for invocation of the state secrets privilege</a> [reply brief, PDF] and alternatively, the privilege is preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sup_01_50_10_36.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act </a>(FISA) [text]. EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston said the <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2011/08/30">courts should be able to review NSA's surveillance</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The scope and legality of the NSA program has been the subject of widespread reporting and debate for half a decade&#8212;it is hardly a secret. And Congress long ago crafted balanced and comprehensive security procedures to govern courts' handling of secret evidence about electronic surveillance to ensure that the Judicial Branch is always able to watch over Executive Branch spying while preserving national security. Yet the government still claims that any judicial scrutiny of the NSA program would disclose 'state secrets' and harm national security. It's time for these lawsuits to proceed and for the courts to be allowed to do their job and determine the legality of the NSA program.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] dismissed <span class="casename">Hepting v. AT&#38;T</span> and <span class="casename">Jewel v. NSA</span> in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

<p>The NSA has come under controversy for its surveillance since 9/11. Last January, the EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/patterns-misconduct-fbi-intelligence-violations">published a report</a> [text] summarizing nearly 2,500 pages of government documents obtained through <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] litigation. Many of the documents are reports made to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/piab">Intelligence Oversight Board</a> (IOB) [official website], an independent agency within the office of the president that oversees the Intelligence Community's compliance with the Constitution and all applicable laws, executive orders, and presidential directives. The report states, "[t]he documents suggest that FBI intelligence investigations have compromised the civil liberties of American citizens far more frequently, and to a greater extent, than was previously assumed." According to the documents, the reported violations to the IOB included violations of intelligence procedures governing investigations and abuses of the FBI's National Security Letter authority, and nearly a fifth were violations of the Constitution, FISA, or other laws governing criminal investigations. The FBI said the violations were <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-fbi-violations-20110130,0,6047844.story">due to technical mistakes</a> [LAT report] and the amount of substantive violations is small. Last September, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oig/index.html">Office of the Inspector General</a> (OIG) [official website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/doj-clears-fbi-of-wrongdoing-in-domestic-advocacy-group-probes.php">absolving the FBI of charges</a> [JURIST report] that agents conducted investigations of domestic groups based on their exercise of <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/print_friendly.html?page=bill_of_rights_transcript_content.html&title=The%20Bill%20of%20Rights%3A%20A%20Transcription">First Amendment</a> [text] rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One defeated proposal was to move back the national election date from the first Tuesday in October to the first Tuesday in November, pushing the election out of the rainy season, which might increase voter turnout, and closer to the January presidential inauguration, which would help to alleviate security concerns. Another change, also rejected, called for a simple majority for victory in local and legislative polls, which aimed to elect officials in a single round, doing away with expensive run-off elections. Also defeated was the proposed amendment to raise the Liberian Supreme Court judge retirement age from 70 to 75. The most controversial proposal would have lowered the residency requirement for presidential candidates from 10 years to five. Predictions are that this change would open up the field to more opposition party candidates and disqualify others, cumulatively increasing the chance for reelection for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/08/ellen-johnson-sirleaf-100-women">President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder]. The existing residency rule was suspended for the 2005 election because most candidates had recently returned from post-war exile. In her results announcement from the capital city of Monrovia, NEC Co-chairman <a href="http://www.necliberia.org/ch_info.php?af17963db3d9ec1f704f4f76084f4636=MTE%3D">Elizabeth Nelson</a> [official profile] calculated that the 34.2 percent turnout rate for the 1,798,930 eligible voters had required each proposal to have more than 400,000 votes to pass (a two-thirds majority). With 99 percent of polls reporting, none of the proposals passed the 300,000 mark. Opposition party <a href="http://www.cdcliberia.org/">Congress for Democratic Change</a> [party website] reportedly <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/liberians-reject-four-proposals-to-amend-nation-s-constitution.html">called on its members to boycott the election</a> [Bloomberg report] and are calling the referendum a victory against the ruling Unity Party.

<p>With no reports of violence at the polls, the referendum still had its procedural issues, including the NEC's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/liberia-constitutional-referendum-ballot-errors-rampant.php">distribution of defective paper ballots</a> [JURIST report]. Despite the referendum, Liberia has been criticized for its poor human rights record in recent years. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33851&amp;Cr=liberia&amp;Cr1=">emphasized</a> [UN News Centre report] in a 2010 progress <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2010/88">report</a> [text, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/liberia-reconciliation-efforts-must.php">reconciliation in Liberia</a> [JURIST report] hinges on the development of its national security and its legal institutions. <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/liberia-facing-poor-human-rights.php">Liberia struggles</a> [JURIST report] with corruption in its criminal justice system, poor detention conditions and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and forced marriage, according to a <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmil/">UN Mission in Liberia</a> [official website] combined quarterly <a href="http://www.unmil.org/documents/humanrights_may_oct_2007_report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released in April 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A public employees union has filed a lawsuit in Indiana state court challenging a state law disallowing future recognition of public employee collective bargaining rights. The <a href="http://www.afscmecn62.org/">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 62</a> [advocacy website], which represents Indiana state employees, <a href="http://www.afscmecn62.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&HomeID=70268">announced that it has filed suit</a> [press release] in <a href="http://www.indy.gov/eGov/Courts/Circuit/Pages/home.aspx">Marion County Circuit Court</a> against <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/">Governor Mitch Daniels</a> [official websites] and his state personnel director Daniel Hackler. The union contends that the legislature unconstitutionally included a collective bargaining prohibition in its passage of the 2011 <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBYQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.in.gov%2Fsba%2Ffiles%2Fap_2011_HEA_1001-2011.pdf&rct=j&q=HEA%201001&ei=UahfTtGsDsPi0QGxxoHcAg&usg=AFQjCNGPTbFSB4DIoxKq2zEz9P_LTlhR9w&sig2=YddFfAlBixWIQR8Y6pqspw&cad=rja">state budget bill</a> [HEA 1001, PDF]. The union is seeking to nullify the ban based on separation of powers provisions in <a href="http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst.html">Indiana's constitution</a> [materials], which hold that the state executive branch has jurisdiction over administrative procedures and employee/employer relations, not the legislature. The budget provisions at issue add a new Chapter to the Indiana Code, effectively making collective bargaining between the state and any union illegal, and taking away any future governor's ability to sign an executive order that would confer collective bargaining rights to state employees:<blockquote>Sec. 4. Collective bargaining between the state and employee organizations and strikes by state employees are illegal.
Sec. 5. The state shall not: (1) recognize a union or any other employee organization as a representative of the employees of the state; (2) bargain collectively with an employee organization; (3) enter into a collectively bargained agreement; or (4) require an employee to join or financially support an employee organization.</blockquote>In addition to challenging the new law as a violation of constitutional separation of powers, the union's lawsuit claims a violation of the Indiana constitution's equal privileges and immunities provision, in that the legislature proscribed collective bargaining for all state employees but provided an exception for the union representing State Police officers. The suit also alleges that the labor provisions being challenged violate the Indiana constitution's single-subject requirement for bills passed by the legislature.

<p>Restrictive collective bargaining laws have been advanced in several states this year. Ohio voters will decide whether to repeal a <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_SB_5_EN_N.pdf">law</a> [SB 5 text, PDF] limiting the collective bargaining rights of state workers after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ohio-collective-bargaining-law-to-go-before-voters-in-november.php">opponents of the bill gathered 915,456 signatures</a> [JURIST report] in late July. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ohio-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in March, but will not go into effect until it survives the public referendum in November. Ten Wisconsin unions <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-union-sues-to-block-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit in federal court in June challenging the state's new collective bargaining law. The lawsuit alleges that the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11 text, PDF] violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [texts]. According to the plaintiffs, the bill discriminates among groups of public employees and eliminates basic union rights, like bargaining, organizing and associating. In July, a judge for the <a href="https://ecf.idd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Idaho</a> [official website] issued a <a href=/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-idaho-anti-union-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking the enforcement of an Idaho anti-union <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1007.pdf">law</a> [SB 1007] that bans a union program that subsidizes employment for its members. The law, called the Fairness in Contracting Act, prohibits union programs used by construction workers unions that pool portions of union wages on a voluntary basis to subsidize union labor to enable union members to be hired at the collectively bargained salary. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Hammarberg said that many European countries began helping the US with secret counter-terrorism measures after the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST archive]. Those measures allegedly included rendition of suspects with the cooperation of local police and the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website], detention in covert facilities and interrogation involving torture. The efforts bypassed traditional judicial systems in European nations: <blockquote>Governments across the European continent have acted in line with the wishes of the US to prevent proper investigations, and particularly judicial scrutiny, of the abuses arising from rendition operations. The message is clear&#8211;good relations between the security agencies are deemed more important than preventing torture and other serious human rights violations.</blockquote>Hammarberg accused officials of covering up evidence of the crimes. He also called on COE member states to begin immediate investigations into rights violations and to allow the crimes to face judicial scrutiny. 

<p>The COE's renewed call for investigations into counter-terrorism actions corresponds with the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In 2006, the COE urged member states to launch investigations after <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/europe-rights-watchdog-says-cia.php">accusing</a> [JURIST report] 14 European countries of collaborating with the CIA by taking an active or passive role in a "global spider's web" of secret prisons and rendition flights. The accusation followed publication of a COE <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.pdf">report</a> [PDF] detailing the results of an investigation into <a href="http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/Files/Events/2006-cia/">alleged secret detention centers</a> [COE materials] and illegal rendition flights operated by the CIA in Europe. The report also referenced the cases of 17 detainees who claim they were kidnapped by US agents and transported to facilities around the globe, including in Romania and Poland. The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/">European Parliament</a> [official website] that year also <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/europe-delegation-says-cia-confirmed.php">conducted a similar investigation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Sarah Singleton stated that "irreparable injury will occur in the form of constitutional deprivations" if the "Residency Verification Program" is not halted. The <a href="http://www.maldef.org/index.html">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy website] filed the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/assets/pdf/DLCase_082411_TRO.PDF">restraining order</a> [text, PDF] and an accompanying <a href="http://www.maldef.org/assets/pdf/DLCase_082411_WOM.PDF"><em>writ of mandamus</em></a> [text, PDF], arguing that the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/news/releases/nm_license_lawsuit/">program is unconstitutional</a> [press release] "because it unfairly targets certain Latinos in New Mexico and places a higher burden on them beyond what the law requires of other residents" and it "constitutes a gross usurpation of power from the Legislature." The governor argues that the program is necessary because New Mexico is one of the few states that does not require proof of residency for a driver's license and therefore it has become a haven for "license rings" which obtain driver's licenses for individuals who have no intention of staying within the state. The program, if allowed to continue, would require a random sample of 10,000 immigrants who have obtained New Mexico driver's licenses to verify their residency via an in-person appointment.

<p>Driver's licenses and immigration reform have been a contentious issue throughout the country. In August, the state of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">appealed the ruling</a> [JURIST report] upholding the injunction against a controversial immigration law to the US Supreme Court. The act would require, in part, any individual with a license from a state which does not require proof of citizenship to obtain a license, such as New Mexico, to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">carry additional documentation</a> [JURIST report] to prove their citizenship. In June, a group including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-blocks-georgia-immigration-law.php">succeeded in blocking</a> [JURIST report] a controversial Georgia immigration law which would allow law enforcement officers to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">not accept driver licenses</a> [JURIST report] from states that do not require a proof of citizenship to obtain a driver's license and detain individuals with these licenses for failure to prove citizenship. <a href="http://samolens.com/">Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens</a> [official website] announced in August that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/georgia-appeals-immigration-law-ruling.php">appeal the ruling</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

She stated: "Torture and detention will never convince the people of Syria that might is right. It is essential for the future of the country and its people that the authorities respect freedom of expression and listen to what their critics have to say." This is the second time that Bokova has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-urges-syria-to-grant-freedom-of-expression-to-citizens-journalists.php">condemned Syria for violence against journalists</a> [JURIST report]. On Sunday, Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-president-issues-new-law-on-media.php">repealed some restrictive media laws</a> [JURIST report] which allowed for the imprisonment of journalists. However, the law still bans any news relates to the armed forces or news that "affects national unity and national security, incites sectarian strife, incites crimes or hatred, or harms state symbols." Additionally, the law extends accountability for media violations to editors, journalists and media spokespersons.

<p>Last month, Syrian political cartoonist Ali Ferzat was <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2011-08-25-ML-Syria/id-fc0e4af5f5af496c84d991f675f5e2cb">found badly beaten</a> [AP report], allegedly by pro-Assad forces. As an apparent message to critics of the Syrian president, the cartoonist's hands were specifically targeted during the attack. Also last month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] issued an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE24/045/2011/en/742ce5ae-f562-4287-9572-a243ffa22f93/mde240452011en.pdf">urgent action</a> [text, PDF] warning that Hanadi Zahlout, a Syrian women's rights activist and freelance journalist, was arrested by the Assad's forces earlier in the month and is at a "serious risk of torture or other ill-treatment."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearings will confirm the charges against three of the six men and will establish if prosecutors have enough evidence to hold a trial. The suspects attending Thursday's hearings, including politician Henry Kiprono Kosgey, radio broadcaster Joshua Arap Sang and presidential candidate William Samoei Ruto, will argue that the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/6EB5C0DA-8D04-4FCF-B0DD-61BBF8505900.htm">does not have jurisdiction</a> [ICC materials] over them. The other three suspects are scheduled to appear for confirmation of charges hearings on September 21. The confirmation hearings began two days after the ICC appeals chamber <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-appeals-chamber-confirms-admissibility-of-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] filed by the Kenyan government and confirmed a Pre-Trial Chamber ruling refusing to transfer the cases. The government of Kenya on Thursday also <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1224430.pdf">filed a request</a> [PDF] to have legal representation in the courtroom to observe the confirmation of charges proceedings. 

<p>The men are part of the "Ocampo Six," and are <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-deny-charges-of-ethnic-killings.php">facing trial</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly inciting violence during and after the December 2007 Kenyan elections. The Ocampo Six include several high-ranking members of Kenya's government, the head of operations at <a href="http://www.kassfm.co.ke/">Kass FM</a> [official website] in Nairobi and the son of Kenya's first president, <a href="http://www.africawithin.com/bios/jomo_kenyatta.htm">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [Africa Within backgrounder]. Three of the men are members of the <a href="http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website] and the other three are members of the opposing Party for National Unity (PNU). The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summoned the suspects</a> [JURIST report] after determining they would not be charged in Kenya for the alleged crimes. In April, Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requested that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the government is capable of prosecuting the six men domestically. Lawyers for the Ocampo Six called for the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-ask-for-evidence-from-icc-prosecutor.php">timely release of evidence</a> [JURIST report] against their clients that month as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The repeal of DADT is set to take effect on September 20, and the DOJ argued the impendency of the repeal renders the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0902-dadt-20110902,0,275613.story">original court case moot</a> [LAT report]. The <a href="http://www.logcabin.org">Log Cabin Republicans</a> (LCR) [advocacy website], the gay rights group that sued over the policy, urged the appeals court to uphold the ruling to prevent the government from banning gay military service in the future, noting that the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-01/-don-t-ask-don-t-tell-ruling-is-moot-u-s-tells-court.html">new Congress may repeal the repeal</a> [Bloomberg report]. The lawyer for the LCR indicated the ruling also serves as an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gP1kWqov4dJbhDA2VIQW4OVQ4vyA?docId=ab2f61c6b7a7462bad9b831a7e5f7055">important legal basis for collateral claims</a> [AP report] for reinstatement, back pay or other compensation related to withheld benefits for service members affected by the policy. The DOJ countered that the court should not speculate about what may or may not happen in the future when making their decision.

<p>In July, the Ninth Circuit ruled that DADT would <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-again-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">remain partially in effect</a> [JURIST report] during the 60 days prior to its newly-scheduled repeal. The court effectively reiterated its order <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] the previous week, in which it reinstated DADT but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy. Hours earlier, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] and the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-certifies-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">certified</a> [JURIST report] DADT's repeal, scheduling the policy to end September 20. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/=/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed the bill to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report] in December.

The ECCC heard testimony from New Zealand expert geriatrician Professor John Campbell that <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/ieng-thirith">Ieng Thirith</a> [ECCC backgrounder], the sister-in-law of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, now 79, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2031800/Doubts-Khmer-Rouge-lady-fit-stand-trial-crimes-humanity.html">suffers from dementia and memory loss</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] commonly caused by Alzheimer's.

Campbell found no major concerns with 84-year-old "Brother Number Two" <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/nuon-chea">Nuon Chea</a> [ECCC backgrounder],  the supposed ideologue of the regime. Chea, however, contests Campbell's assessment and requested another examination by a different specialist. Because Ieng Thirith's assessment might take months, the joint trial of the four former Khmer Rouge leaders may be further delayed until next year.

<p>In May, a panel in the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ex-khmer-rouge-minister-denied-pre-trial-release.php">denied a motion for pretrial release</a> [JURIST report] by former Khmer Rouge official <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/ieng-sary">Ieng Sary</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ieng+Sary">news archive</a>]. Ieng, 85, served as deputy foreign minister under the Khmer Rouge regime during its reign in Cambodia from 1975-1979. Ieng's co-defendants in <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/2">ECCC Case 2</a> [materials], Nuon Chea, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> [ECCC backgrounder] and Ieng Thirith have all challenged pretrial custody unsuccessfully. In March, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-personpage/kaing-guek-eav">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">news archive</a>], a former prison chief at the notorious Toul Sleng prison under the Khmer Rouge, better known as "Duch," <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-khmer-rouge-official-in-court-to-appeal-war-crimes-convictions.php">appealed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">35-year sentence for war crimes</a> [JURIST reports] and crimes against humanity handed down by the ECCC last July.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A three-judge panel sitting for the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/101113p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that immigrants who are imprisoned while fighting deportation cannot be held indefinitely without a bail hearing and that the government must justify the need for the prolonged detention.  The ruling came in an appeal of a district court decision brought by Senegalese native Cheikh Diop who was detained for two years and 11 months pursuant to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/usc_sec_08_00001226----000-.html">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996</a> (IIRIRA) [8 USC &#167; 1226]. IIRIRA requires that any immigrant who has committed a crime involving "moral turpitude" or a crime involving a controlled substance be taken into custody pending removal. Diop was detained on the basis of a 2005 conviction in state court for reckless endangerment and on a 1995 conviction for possession of a controlled substance. The court acknowledged that the statute does not provide for the possibility of release on bond and does not require the government to justify the detention, but ruled that because it is presumed that Congress does not intend to pass unconstitutional laws, "the statute implicitly authorizes detention for a reasonable amount of time, after which the authorities must make an individualized inquiry into whether detention is still necessary to fulfill the statute's purposes." The court also ruled that:<blockquote>In this case, there can be no question that Diop's detention for nearly three years without further inquiry into whether it was necessary to ensure his appearance at the removal proceedings or to prevent a risk of danger to the community, was unreasonable and, therefore, a violation of the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>Diop was released in February after numerous court appearances. During the court proceedings surrounding Diop's case, it was determined that his 2005 conviction was not serious enough to fall under the statute, and his 1995 conviction was vacated in light of the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-651.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-rules-lawyer-must-inform.php">Padilla v. Kentucky</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which submitted a brief on behalf of Diop as <em>amicus curiae</em>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/federal-court-says-prolonged-mandatory-detention-immigrants-unconstitutional">praised the ruling</a> [press release] and urged the US government to use the ruling as a basis for changing current detention practices.  

<p>The US government has faced criticism over the immigrant detention system. In March, the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACH) [official website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-criticizes-us-immigrant-detention-system.php">detailing investigations into immigrant detention centers</a> [JURIST report]. The report expressed concern over increased use of detention by the US government, citing a doubling in detention of non-citizens by the US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website]. It criticized the US government for viewing detention as a necessity and not as an exception in its enforcement. IACH also found the average 30 day detentions troubling, arguing that it is likely to increase as backlogs of immigration cases increase. The number of immigration cases pending is expected to rise in light of the numerous state laws that have been enacted to address the issue of immigration. Absent comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level, several states including <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">Arizona</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-enjoins-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports] have passed legislation aimed at addressing the issue of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=illegal+immigration">illegal immigration</a> [JURIST news archive]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthealthcare.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi</a> [official website] ruled this week that a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">health care reform law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] will be allowed to proceed. The lawsuit was filed by citizens of Mississippi, including the state's <a href="http://www.ltgovbryant.com/">Lt. Governor Phil Bryant</a> [official website] acting as a private citizen, and alleges that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (PPACA) <a href="http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/article/20110901/NEWS01/109010324/Judge-allows-challenge-health-care-law-continue-next-step">individual mandate provision is unconstitutional</a> [<em>Hattiesburg American</em> report]. The plaintiffs argue that if it stands, the law would allow Congress virtually unlimited power in regulating private activities. The plaintiffs also allege that they are currently being harmed by the individual mandate provision, which does not go into effect until 2014, because they are <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/article/Judge-allows-health-care-suit-to-continue-2150789.php">having to forgo spending now</a> [AP report] in order to save money to pay a possible penalty for not having insurance in the future. District Judge Keith Starrett stated that the government's arguments for a dismissal were not persuasive and that the private citizens have standing to challenge the law as a <a href="http://leadercall.com/local/x2134991169/Judge-rules-against-nation-s-new-health-care-law">violation of medical privacy</a> [<em>Laurel Leader-Call</em> report]. Starrett did dismiss a claim brought by Bryant on behalf of state employees on the basis that Bryant is not guaranteed to be an employee of the state in 2014 because his term is up at the end of the year, and therefore cannot represent a group that will be harmed by the individual mandate provision. Bryant <a href="http://www.ltgovbryant.com/news/2010/Dec/obamasuit.html">praised the decision</a> [statement] allowing the lawsuit to proceed stating that he has long believed that the legislation is unconstitutional, and that he looks forward to continuing the court proceedings. A lawyer for Bryant indicated that he may refile the claim on behalf of state employees if he is elected governor. 

<p>Similar cases challenging the constitutionality of PPACA are being heard in federal courts across the nation. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">struck down the individual mandate</a> [JURIST report] as unconstitutional. Earlier in August, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by a physician organization for lack of standing. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the law</a> in June, and the ruling was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?568366954">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website] to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Also in June, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decided it could rule on two challenges to PPACA after the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/fourth-circuit-questions-authority-to-hear-health-care-law-challenge.php">requested briefs</a> [JURIST report] from all parties on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> (AIA) [text], which prevents injunctions against taxes before the tax is imposed, would bar review of PPACA until it is implemented. The Fourth Circuit already <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in May to resolve a split decision between the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against the individual mandate</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports] of the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The emergency laws were established during the nearly 30-year civil war with the Tamil Tigers. <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] did approve four terrorism regulations under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, two of which will allow the Parliament to hold rebel suspects. The four terrorism regulations are currently part of Sri Lankan law on a temporary basis, but the government plans to make these policies permanent law.

<p>In August, the Sri Lankan government announced it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/sri-lanka-to-end-emergency-laws.php">lift the emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] that have been in place for 30 years, though Parliament would <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/news/ViewNews.do?recID=NWS2273">renew</a> [text] some provisions temporarily. Most clauses of the Public Security Ordinance, which permits suspects to be detained indefinitely and without charge, have already been abolished. Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.pmoffice.gov.lk/">Prime Minister DM Jayaratne</a> [official website] told Parliament that some clauses would remain necessary, even though the civil war ended in 2009. The Sri Lankan emergency laws have been in a state of flux in recent years. Sri Lankan lawmakers voted last year to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/sri-lanka-parliament-eases-state-of-emergency-restrictions.php">extend the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] but reduced some of the toughest provisions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The draft <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html">Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a> [materials] would have reduced the amount of smog emissions to between 0.060 and 0.070 parts per million (ppm) from the previous 0.075 ppm. The EPA estimates that these changes would help reduce the effects of climate change and improve public health, saving the US between $13 billion and $100 billion in health care costs. The stricter smog standards, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/epa-proposes-stricter-smog-regulations.php">proposed by the EPA in January 2010</a> [JURIST report], would have replaced the Bush administration's broader <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/standards.html">2008 national smog regulations</a> [text], complying with scientific recommendations. In his statement, Obama recognized recent efforts to improve environmental protection, but emphasized the need to trim down regulations in light of the economic downturn:<blockquote>Over the last two and half years, my administration, under the leadership of EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, has taken some of the strongest actions since the enactment of the Clean Air Act four decades ago to protect our environment and the health of our families from air pollution. From reducing mercury and other toxic air pollution from outdated power plants to doubling the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks, the historic steps we've taken will save tens of thousands of lives each year, remove over a billion tons of pollution from our air, and produce hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits for the American people. At the same time, I have continued to underscore the importance of reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as our economy continues to recover.</blockquote> The president also indicated that studies are currently being conducted in anticipation of a 2013 review of the smog standards.

<p>The EPA announced in September 2009 that it would <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/epa-to-review-national-smog-standards.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] national smog standards to ensure accuracy and public health. The decision to review the smog standards came in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/environmental-groups-states-sue-epa.php">legal challenge</a> [JURIST report] filed by <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/">Earthjustice</a> [advocacy website] on behalf of several environmental organizations. The suit alleged that the EPA ignored the input of top scientists before <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/epa-announces-stricter-smog-rule.php">issuing its smog regulations</a> [JURIST report] in March 2008. The EPA has the power to monitor ozone levels under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [text, PDF]. Ground-level ozone, referred to as smog, has been linked to respiratory health issues and adverse effects on the environment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court upheld the provision that requires doctors to tell patients prior to an abortion "that [she] has an existing relationship with that unborn human being and that the relationship enjoys protection under the United States Constitution and under the laws of South Dakota" and that "by having an abortion, her existing relationship and her existing constitutional rights with regards to that relationship will be terminated." <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/mn-nd-sd/">Planned Parenthood Federation of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota</a> [advocacy website], which brought the suit, argued that the relationship advisories "unconstitutionally compel ideological speech by doctors" and are an attempt to inform women that abortion is morally wrong. The court stated the provision just informs the woman that she cannot be forced to have an abortion and thus does not represent an undue burden on her decision to have an abortion. However, the court upheld the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-partially-upholds-south.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST report] to strike down the provision that required doctors to inform women seeking an abortion that their risk of suicide would go up as a result of the abortion. The court stated that the abortion advisory posed an undue burden on women because there was much debate in the medical community about the matter and a significant amount of evidence to the contrary.

<p>The informed consent law was originally <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/south-dakota-governor-signs-bills.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 but has faced years of court challenges and appeals. South Dakota <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">passed another controversial abortion law</a> [JURIST report] in March which requires women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. In July the Planned Parenthood Federation of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota and the <a href="http://www.aclusd.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota</a> [advocacy website] succeeded in obtaining a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-south-dakota-abortion-law-with-72-hour-waiting-period.php">preliminary injunction against the law</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a UN-produced report released by the <em>New York Times</em> amid objections from Turkey and Israel, the UN found that the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip was lawful but that Israel's response to Turkish ships attempting to penetrate the blockade were "excessive and unreasonable." The raid resulted in the deaths of nine Turkish passengers. The blockade was warranted, the UN conceded, but Israel should have taken alternative measures to avoid a violent confrontation:<blockquote>The fundamental principle of the freedom of navigation on the high seas is subject to only certain limited exceptions under international law. Israel faces a real threat to its security from militant groups in Gaza. The naval blockade was imposed as a legitimate security measure in order to prevent weapons from entering Gaza by sea and its implementation complied with the requirements of international law... Non-violent options should have been used in the first instance. In particular, clear prior warning that the vessels were to be boarded and a demonstration of dissuading force should have been given to avoid the type of confrontation that occurred. The operation should have reassessed its options when the resistance to the initial boarding attempt became apparent.</blockquote>The report is expected to be formally released by the UN later Friday. In response to the report, Turkey <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Turkey-Expels-Israeli-Ambassador-Over-Leaked-UN-Report-129046108.html">expelled the Israeli ambassador</a> [VOA report] to Ankara and suspended military agreements with Israel.

<p>Numerous investigations into the flotilla raid have been conducted since the incident took place. The Turkish <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.tr/default.en.mfa">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/turkey-to-conduct-investigation-into-flotilla-raid.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in August 2010 that it would <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.tr/no_-180_-11-agustos-2010_-bm-sorusturma-paneline-sunulacak-raporun-hazirlanmasi-maksadiyla-kurulan-ulusal-arastirma-ve-inceleme.tr.mfa">conduct an investigation</a> [press release, in Turkish] into the raid. Two months earlier, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-announces-members-of-flotilla-inquiry-panel.php">announced the composition</a> [JURIST report] of the international panel of inquiry. The Israeli government has established two internal commissions to investigate its response to the flotilla, one <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-launches-internal-probe-of-flotilla-attack.php">military</a> and one <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/israel-pm-appoints-former-supreme-court-judge-to-head-flotilla-raid-probe.php">civilian</a> [JURIST reports]. Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">profile</a>] testified before the civilian commission in August 2010 that <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/israel-complied-with-international-law-in-flotilla-raid-pm.php">Israel did not violate international law</a> [JURIST report]. During his testimony, Netanyahu expressed confidence that the commission would find Israeli actions to be in compliance with international law and explained the Israeli response to the flotilla in the context of the ongoing conflict between Israel and <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8968/hamas.html">Hamas</a> [CFR backgrounder]. Netanyahu continued to accuse Hamas of "at least four war crimes: inciting to genocide; systematically and intentionally firing on civilians; using civilians as human shields; and preventing visits by the Red Cross to kidnapped IDF soldier, Gilad Shalit." In July 2010, an Israeli military probe <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/Israel-probe-finds-intelligence-mistakes-in-Gaza-flotilla-raid.php">found insufficient intelligence and planning</a> [JURIST report] in the raid in a report, but also concluded that no punishments were necessary. Israeli forces raided six ships attempting to deliver more than 10,000 tons of aid to Gaza in May 2010. The raid left numerous wounded and resulted in the deaths of nine pro-Palestine activists&#8212;eight Turks and one American.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/eu-kosovo-authorities-arrest-suspected-war-criminals.php">previously arrested in March</a> [JURIST report]. Among those charged is Fatmir Limaj, a prominent political figure in the <a href="http://www.pdk49.com/index.php?page=1,1">Democratic Party of Kosovo</a> (PDK) [official website, in Albanian]. In order for the court to try him, parliament would have to <a href="http://arabnews.com/world/article496729.ece">dissolve his immunity</a> [Reuters report].

<p>EULEX has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">investigating war crimes</a> [JURIST report] since December 2008.

The trial of two Serbian defendants was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/first-eu-kosovo-trial-blocked-by.php">derailed</a> [JURIST report] that month by hundreds of Serbian protesters and postponed indefinitely.

Davutoglu denounced the report's finding that the Gaza naval blockade is lawful.

Kepiro was acquitted of participating in the 1942 Novi Sad massacre in Serbia and, ultimately, pleaded his innocence until his death, stating he had refused to shoot during the massacre. Kepiro was convicted both in 1944 and 1946 and sentenced to 10 years for involvement in the raids, but he was released and fled to Argentina. His recent acquittal stemmed from deterioration of evidence. Kepiro and his lawyer appealed so the record would reflect that Kepiro was completely innocent.

<p>Despite the ages of the accused, prosecutions of Nazis continue around the world.

Chirac is being tried for allegedly misusing funds during his time as Paris mayor in 1990. Chirac's lawyers filed an extensive neurological report with the court amid <a href = "http://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/Actualite/Une-grande-lucidite-et-des-moments-d-absence-261079/">unconfirmed public reports</a> [<em>Journal du Dimanch</em> report, in French] that he is suffering from <a href = "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/alzheimersdisease.html">Alzheimer's disease</a> [MedLine backgrounder]. The lawyers' report did diagnose Chirac with anosognosia, a mental disorder where one does not acknowledge one's illness due to brain damage often caused by a stroke. <a href = "http://anticor.org/">Anticor</a> [advocacy website, in French], an anti-corruption organization, <a href = "http://anticor.org/2011/08/31/le-proces-chirac-va-reprendre/">demanded that Chirac face trial</a> [press release, in French]. Judge Dominique Pauthe will rule on Chirac's health when the trial begins on Monday.

<p>The French <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French], the country's highest appeals court, ruled in May that the corruption trial against Chirac could continue, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/france-court-orders-chirac-corruption-trial-to-resume.php">rejecting a constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST report] brought by one of his co-defendants. Last September, the Paris city council <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-ex-president-chirac-settles-with-paris-in-corruption-case.php">accepted a settlement deal</a> [JURIST report] in which the former president agreed to pay USD $741,000 in compensation for the money paid out for false jobs. In exchange, the city agreed to drop out of the corruption suit. Chirac stated that the settlement was not an admission of guilt. A French judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-judge-orders-probe-of-chirac.php">placed Chirac under preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. Chirac's trial on corruption charges <a href="/hotline/2009/12/jacques-chiracs-trial-on-corruption.php">marks the first time</a> [JURIST comment] a former president will have to answer to charges against him in a court of law. The trial is a combination of two separate corruption-related cases, in which Chirac allegedly financed the Rally for the Republic (RPR), now renamed as the <a href="http://www.lemouvementpopulaire.fr/">Union for a Popular Movement</a> [party website, in French], by illegally establishing fake city positions between 1977 and 1995 for party members to collect salaries totaling several million dollars. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill mandates that if no candidate amasses 50 percent of the vote after the election, a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/03/us-panama-runoffs-idUSTRE7821TA20110903">second round of voting would take place</a> [Reuters report]. A presidential election is currently won by a mere majority vote. Panamanian <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.pa/hoja-de-vida-presidente.html">President Ricardo Martinelli</a> [official website, in Spanish] praised the reform bill, while critics argue the bill constitutes an effort to keep the president's <a href="http://www.cambiodemocratico.org.pa/">Democratic Change Party</a> [official website, in Spanish] in power. The unicameral legislature will ultimately vote to grant final approval, though opposition will likely challenge the bill in court.

<p>Voters elected Martinelli president in May 2009 national elections "considered generally free and fair by independent observers" according to a 2010 US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154514.htm">Human Rights report</a> [text]. On the other hand, local elections have been marred by controversy. <a href="http://www.hrev.org/">Human Rights Everywhere</a> (HRE) [advocacy website], a non profit organization, described the elections in the Ngobe-Bugle community as "confusing" and ill-timed. Martinelli won the 2009 election with over 60 percent of the vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The nearly 20 jailed doctors face charges in relation to protests and have begun fasting in objection to "continued detention of the doctors and other detainees at the Dry Docks prison, as well as the ill treatment and torture, not having access to legal counsel, and what they described as being ridiculous charges against them." Human rights activists Abdul Jalil al-Singace and Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, who were sentenced to life in prison in June, also joined the hunger strike. The detainees maintain that if the trials take place, they <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2011/09/201193161643416929.html">should be held in civil courts</a> [Al Jazeera report] rather than military tribunals.

<p>Bahraini <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced last week that he will <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, Bahrain's Lower National Safety Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-military-court-sentences-eight-activists-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced 21 activists</a> [JURIST report] for anti-government protests conducted earlier this year. Also in June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. The National Safety Courts, special military tribunals, were instituted in mid-March under Khalifa's <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and have been internationally criticized, most <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">recently</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-sentences-shiite-cleric-8-others-for-police-kidnapping.php">sentenced nine citizens</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in prison for kidnapping a police officer in May. In April, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">handed the death sentence</a> to four protesters, a rarity in Bahrain, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-upholds-2-death-sentencess-for-police-killings--dnp.php">upheld the sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for two of the men who were accused of murdering police officers. All of the charges levied in the National Safety Court have been disputed by Bahraini citizens and international rights organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Court convened in the Landsdomur, a special court to try cabinet ministers, with Haarde's lawyers requesting a dismissal of all charges, which carry a maximum penalty of two years in prison. Haarde argued for dismissal on six points: no proper probe had been conducted before the charges were brought against him; the indictment was vague and unclear with no specific arguments to back up the indictment; a <a href = "http://www.ruv.is/frett/telur-saksoknara-althingis-vanhaefan">conflict of interest with the prosecutor</a> [RUV report, in Icelandic] in the case who advised the parliamentary committee that proposed the indictment; the procedural rules in Landsdomur court are unclear; and a lack of equal treatment guaranteed in the constitution by the court only indicting Haarde, as opposed to all four ministers implicated in the <a href="http://sic.althingi.is/">Special Investigation Committee</a> (SIC) [official website] <a href = "http://sic.althingi.is/pdf/RNAvefurKafli21Enska.pdf">"Truth Report"</a> [text, PDF]. Haarde <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/iceland-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges-over-%20role-in-banking-collapse.php">previously pleaded not guilty in June</a> [JURIST report]. The court is expected to rule within four weeks.

<p>Last September, the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website, in Icelandic] referred charges to the Landsdomur after the SIC released a report claiming that seven Icelandic government officials acted with gross negligence in their management of the country's financial system prior to a 2008 bank collapse. The SIC determined that Haarde and former central bank head <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/thingm/1701487469.html?knt=1701487469">David Oddsson</a> [official profile, in Icelandic] knew that banks were assuming overseas debt but took no action to prevent or mitigate the effects of the accumulation. The SIC also found that former minister of finance Arni Mathiessen, then-banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson, former <a href="http://www.fme.is/?PageID=146">Financial Services Authority</a> [official website] director Jonas Jonsson and central bank officials Eirikur Gundason and Ingimundur Fridriksson failed to take appropriate action when presented with information about the poor state of the country's financial sector.  Iceland was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7658908.stm">hit hard</a> [BBC backgrounder] by the financial crisis  that emanated from securities related to the US mortgage market. When <a href="http://www.kaupthing.com/pages/4189">Kaupthing</a>, <a href="http://www.landsbanki.is/english/">Landsbanki</a> and <a href="http://glitnirbank.com/">Glitnir</a> [corporate websites] were taken over by the Icelandic government in 2008, they were holding debt equal to more than <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrvnmZfcNSF0flZgJlFOhmk3CX1w">900 percent</a> [AFP report] of Iceland's gross domestic product, causing the country's economy to collapse and the government to <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extrans1.aspx?memberKey1=420&endDate=2010-04-13&finposition_flag=YES">rely on loans</a> [IMF materials] from the <a href="http://www.imf.org/">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website] to meet its obligations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As the first witness for the prosecution began testimony during the trial's third hearing, <a href="http://thedailynewsegypt.com/egypt/witnesses-testify-in-trial-of-mubaraks-adly-and-aides.html">plaintiffs and their lawyers clashed with Mubarak supporters</a> [Daily News Egypt report]. The witness was a police official who testified that he heard over wireless networks "unilateral" orders to deploy firearms to protect the <a href="http://www.moiegypt.gov.eg/english/">Ministry of Interior</a> [official website] headquarters on Jan. 28. Outside the court, demonstrators tussled with police, with several injuries reported. Hundreds of victims' families and protesters attempted to break through the main gates and enter the court building. Riot police swung batons and briefly clashed with the protesters, who threw stones at the security forces. Mubarak is on trial for murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">general abuse of power</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] stemming from his response to pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year. Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial for corruption charges.

<p>Mubarak's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">began on August 3</a> [JURIST report] with Mubarak and his sons pleading not guilty to all charges.

Officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place at a convention center in downtown Cairo. In July, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, so it would coincide with Mubarak's trial.

It was because of accusations of complicity by the British Security Services in the mistreatment of detainees overseas, including rendition, that I took steps last July to sort this whole problem out. As the House will remember we took steps to bring to an end the large number of court cases being brought against the government by former inmates of Guantanamo. We have issued new guidance to security service personnel on how to deal with detainees held by other countries. And we have asked Sir Peter Gibson to examine issues around the detention and treatment of terrorist suspects overseas and the Inquiry has already said it will look at these latest accusation very carefully. My concern throughout has been to deal with these accusations of malpractice so as to enable the Security Services to get on with the vital work they do.</blockquote> Papers <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14786924">tying M16 and the CIA to Libya</a> [BBC report] were discovered when Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi's</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] compound was raided last month. The Detainee Inquiry released a <a href = "http://www.detaineeinquiry.org.uk/2011/09/statement-by-the-inquiry-2/">statement</a> [text] confirming the investigation. Cameron also spoke on continuing to support the <a href = "http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website] effort in Libya and aiding the new Libyan government.

<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/"><em>The Guardian</em></a> [media website] released a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/uk-secret-interrogation-policy-revealed.php">top secret document</a> [JURIST report] revealing details about the interrogation policies of UK intelligence officials. The document indicated that officers from the UK security and secret intelligence agencies, <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website], and MI6, respectively, were instructed to weigh the severity of the mistreatment of a detainee with the benefits of possibly obtaining information from the prisoner. The agencies "do not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment," the document said, though the agencies would "consider applying caveats or seeking prior assurances" if they foresee a risk of possibly mistreating or torturing a detainee. In November, the UK government <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">announced a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with 16 Guantanamo Bay detainees over allegations of torture. In return, the 16 detainees, 12 of whom had filed suit and four of whom were planning to, agreed to drop a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/uk-court-allows-ex-guantanamo-detainees-torture-suit-to-continue.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against MI5 and M16. The government issued a new set of regulations regarding the use of information obtained via torture in July 2010 shortly after the human rights group <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-government-to-overhaul-interrogation-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a review of the country's torture policy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Chirac and his legal team filed documents with the court on Friday <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/chirac-too-ill-to-attend-corruption-trial-lawyers.php">claiming Chirac is too ill to face his corruption trial</a> [JURIST report], just three days before the trial was scheduled to continue after being <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/france-ex-president-chirac-goes-on-trial-for-corruption.php">delayed in March</a> [JURIST report]. Chirac's lawyers on Friday submitted to the judge a letter with four pages of attached medical records, including a brain scan, suggesting the former president may have a condition linked to <a href = "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/alzheimersdisease.html">Alzheimer's disease</a> [MedLine backgrounder]. The lawyers' report did diagnose Chirac with anosognosia, a mental disorder where one does not acknowledge one's illness due to brain damage often caused by a stroke. Chirac is being tried for allegedly misusing funds during his time as Paris mayor in 1990.

<p>The French <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French], the country's highest appeals court, ruled in May that the corruption trial against Chirac could continue, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/france-court-orders-chirac-corruption-trial-to-resume.php">rejecting a constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST report] brought by one of his co-defendants. Last September, the Paris city council <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-ex-president-chirac-settles-with-paris-in-corruption-case.php">accepted a settlement deal</a> [JURIST report] in which the former president agreed to pay USD $741,000 in compensation for the money paid out for false jobs. In exchange, the city agreed to drop out of the corruption suit. Chirac stated that the settlement was not an admission of guilt. A French judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-judge-orders-probe-of-chirac.php">placed Chirac under preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. Chirac's trial on corruption charges <a href="/hotline/2009/12/jacques-chiracs-trial-on-corruption.php">marks the first time</a> [JURIST comment] a former French president will have to answer to charges against him in a court of law. The trial is a combination of two separate corruption-related cases, in which Chirac allegedly financed the Rally for the Republic (RPR), now renamed as the <a href="http://www.lemouvementpopulaire.fr/">Union for a Popular Movement</a> [party website, in French], by illegally establishing fake city positions between 1977 and 1995 for party members to collect salaries totaling several million dollars.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was found guilty of 12 out of 13 charges, including aiding and abetting murders occurring during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], inhumane acts, attacks on civilians, unjust persecutions and having knowingly supplied "extensive logistical assistance" to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) and the Army of Serbian Krajina (SVK) that would be used to torture and kill hundreds of Muslim civilians. He was also found guilty on the basis of command responsibility for the inhumane acts of his officers and subsequently failing to punish them. The judgement against Perisic states:<blockquote>It would be difficult to over state the magnitude of the crimes perpetrated in Sarajevo. The siege lasted for nearly four years during which Sarajevo civilians endured conditions of terror due to the indiscriminate nature of the attacks. Thousands of men, women and children were killed, and tens of thousands injured. In particular, Sarajevo civilians were regularly shelled and sniped in the course of [Perisic's] tenure as Chief of the VJ General Staff, a lengthy time span. ... Civilians were targeted in their homes, at places of worship, in hospitals and schools. Women, children, and the elderly were not spared.</blockquote>Perisic is the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j1K-W3hVO8ktkQNHogU3T2QzD-vQ?docId=7fb8b8759c294ab3a56b9a07d2d6a9b2">first Yugoslav convicted</a> [AP report] by the UN for crimes committed during the war in Bosnia. Perisic is entitled to time served and has a right to appeal. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mladic">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive], with whom Perisic allegedly collaborated, is still awaiting trial for genocide at The Hague. 

<p>In March, UN prosecutors demanded that <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-prosecutors-demand-life-sentence-for-ex-yugoslav-army-chief.php">Perisic receive a life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Bosnian Muslims in the early 1990s.

Members of the commission include former government officials, diplomats, academics, doctors and lawyers, some of whom have made statements in the past defending the country's human rights record. The commission has been <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=22025">met with skepticism</a> [<em>Irrawaddy</em> report] regarding the potential veracity of the group's findings and whether it will have the authority and independence from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=myanmar">Myanmar government</a> [JURIST news archive] to be effective. Myanmar's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thein Stein</a> [BBC profile] appears willing to ease international tensions and improve the <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/1151420/1/.html">regime's image</a> [AFP report]. This will be the second attempt to create a human rights commission as the first failed in 2000 to have any impact. 

<p>The newly formed commission comes on the heels of a visit by UN Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-probe-abuses.php">urged the government</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11332&LangID=E">improve its rights record</a> [press release]. Quintana said that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/myanmar-ethnic-violence-limiting-transition-to-democracy-un-rights-expert.php">continued ethnic violence</a> [JURIST report] in Myanmar presents "serious limitations" to the government's transition to democracy. In May, Myanmar began releasing close to 15,000 prisoners, but many human rights groups claim the government is still holding many more political prisoners. Quintana urged Myanmar's military government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">release 2,202 political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] last December. He called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," many of whom, he says, suffer from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy. In March, Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">underwent a transfer of power</a> [BBC report] from a military regime to a civil system after holding its first elections in 20 years. However, critics argue that the new regime is merely a sham since it is made up of military generals and with the military party winning 80 percent of the vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en">Bahrain Center for Human Rights</a> [official website], the National Safety Court of Appeal, a court composed of military prosecutors and civilian and military judges, heard the appeals of <a href="http://byshr.org/wp-content/List-of-Defendants-BYSHR.pdf">21 activists</a> [profiles, PDF] who were sentenced to prison after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">Bahraini government imposed martial law</a> [JURIST report] to crack down on protesters in the region. Eight of the protesters arrested and jailed received life sentences, including prominent Shiite leaders Hassan Mushaima and Abdul Jalil al-Singace. The protesters have been on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-detainees-join-hunger-strike-rights-group.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] to show support for doctors jailed for treating those injured in during the demonstrations. A lawyer for one of the defendants said that <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/471223">court had been adjourned</a> [BNA report] with the next appearance before the court scheduled for September 28. 

<p>These appeals come days after Bahraini <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-military-court-sentences-eight-activists-to-life-in-prison.php">21 activists were sentenced</a> [JURIST report] after being <a href="http://byshr.org/wp-content/Charges-and-Articles.pdf">charged</a> [charges, PDF] with "plotting to topple the leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain." Also in June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights announced that <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">Bahrain agreed to permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. The National Safety Courts were instituted in mid-March and have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">internationally criticized, most recently</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website].

According to Hammarberg, the CIA collaborated with its foreign counterparts in detaining "high value detainees" for periods of up to four-and-a-half years in secret "Black Sites." Hammarberg alleges that during their detainment <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enhanced+interrogation">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST news archive] were used on the terror suspects. These techniques included "forced nudity, shackling in stress positions, extended sleep deprivation, dietary manipulation, slapping, walling and waterboarding." The commissioner called on the three nations to investigate these allegations:<blockquote>At the height of the "war on terror", Poland, Romania and Lithuania extended quite extraordinary permissions and protections to their American partners&#8212;while respecting conditions of total secrecy. Today, years later, darkness still enshrouds those who authorised and ran the Black Sites on European territories. The full truth must now be established and guarantees given that such forms of co-operation will never be repeated. Effective investigations are imperative and long overdue.</blockquote>Hammarberg warned that the cost of refusing to investigate the alleged secret detention and torture practices could damage the European system of human rights protection.

<p>Many have come under fire for special detention and torture practices. In June, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-to-investigate-2-overseas-detainee-deaths.php">continue investigating the deaths of two detainees</a> [JURIST report] who died during interrogations by the CIA.  In January, a federal judge told the CIA that it <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-tells-cia-to-investigate-destruction-of-interrogation-tapes.php">must investigate the destruction of the interrogation tapes</a> [JURIST report] related to individuals detained after <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=9%2F11">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. In February, human rights advocacy groups urged the signatory states of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">pursue criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against former US president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=George+W.+Bush">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] in connection with allegations of enhanced interrogation techniques. Advocacy groups have also called for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/rights-groups-ask-spain-court-to-open-probe-into-bush-era-torture.php">investigations into Bush-era torture practices by the Spanish government</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ukraine relies heavily on <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/112243/">Russian oil imports</a> [Reuters report], and its territory provides transit for 80 percent of Russia's oil supplies to Europe. Yanukovych would like to get out of a 10-year deal signed with Russia in 2009, but Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated that this would only be possible if Ukraine joined the Russian-led customs union. Kiev has repeatedly denied this offer, instead threatening to take this issue to Stockholm arbitration court. Yanukovych has contented that the price for gas is unfair and states that the <a href="http://www.sundaytimes.lk/world-news/10551-ukraine-to-take-russia-to-court-in-gas-row-president.html">2001 accords</a> [AFP report] signed by former Ukrainian prime minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">news archive</a>] should serve as the basis of gas relations between Ukraine and Russia. Yanukovych said that it is currently overpaying for oil by about $5 to $6 million annually. The EU has criticized Yanukovych over how he handled the trial of Tymoshenko.

<p>In July, a Ukrainian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/index_2011_07_18.php#37076">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Serhiy Vlasenko, a lawyer representing Tymoshenko, from judicial proceedings. Vlasenko had been defending Tymoshenko in a criminal case related to United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by the former prime minister. The Pechersky District Court of Kiev dismissed Vlasenko saying he was responsible for systematic violation of order in the court, in contempt of court and responsible for obstruction of justice with disregard for the rule of law. Also in July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/sbu/control/uk/index">Security Service of Ukraine</a> (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are launching a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/index_2011_07_06.php#36836">criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into UESU, an energy company at one time headed by former Tymoshenko. The SBU is investigating UESU's potential embezzlement of USD $405 million from the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two acts of <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">Parliament</a> [official website] in place since 1925 have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14800838">banned filming</a> [BBC report] in both Welsh and English courts. Clarke believes that this change will help to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2011/sep/06/ban-filming-courts-to-be-lifted">improve public confidence</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the criminal justice system. Filming will only cover the summary remarks made by judges and not victims, witnesses or offenders. Although Scotland does not have a ban on cameras, all parties must agree to allow the case to be broadcast. Initially, cameras will be allowed in the court of appeals and eventually expanded to the crown court, in accordance with consultations with the judiciary.

<p>In June, the <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/index.php">Philippines Supreme Court</a> [official website] said that it would allow the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/philippine-high-court-to-allow-live-broadcast-of-maguindanao-massacre-trial.php">live broadcast</a> [JURIST report] of the November 2009 <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">Maguindanao Massacre</a> [CSM backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Philippines+Massacre">news archive</a>] trial subject to guidelines set by the court. In September 2010, US federal judges reached an agreement on a pilot project allowing certain civil trials to be <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judges-approve-pilot-project-to-televise-civil-trials.php">televised</a> [JURIST report]. Federal appellate judge <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/VL+-+Judges+-+DBS">David Sentelle</a> [official profile] said that, while the details still needed to be worked out, the judges agreed that the faces of jurors and witnesses will not be recorded and that either party to the suit can opt out of the trial being televised.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Several media outlets interpreted the court as being in favor of granting standing. <a href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website], one of the plaintiffs, called the court's potential ruling <a href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/ny_20110906_lambda-legal-statement-after.html">impossible to predict</a> [press release] and remained optimistic: "We continue to hope that the Court will ultimately decide that small groups of unelected individuals who are answerable to no one should not be able to act on behalf of the state."</p>

<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] in June rejected a motion by Proposition 8 supporters to vacate Walker's holding that the same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional. In March, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ninth-circuit-refuses-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] filed by California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-ag-asks-ninth-circuit-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-stay.php">lift the stay order</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting gay couples from marrying while the appeal is pending.

The ruling upholds an injunction issued by a district court that has temporarily reinstated these benefits, although the law itself has not fully been ruled on in state courts. The three judge-panel echoed many of the district court's sentiments, rejecting arguments from the state of Arizona that the case created an unequivocal right to health care and that the law was not rationally related to promoting marriage nor did it significantly balance the budget:<blockquote>Defendants nevertheless contend on appeal that this law is rationally related to the state's interests in cost savings and reducing administrative burdens. As the district court observed, however, the savings depend upon distinguishing between homosexual and heterosexual employees, similarly situated, and such a distinction cannot survive rational basis review.</blockquote>A representative for <a href = "http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] said they are <a href = "http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2011/09/06/20110906arizona-same-sex-partners-benefits-ruling.html">considering appealing the ruling</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report] and that the court had created an inequality by making it impossible to eliminate benefits for same-sex couples, but permissible to eliminate them for opposite sex couples.

<p>A 2008 executive order from then-governor Janet Napolitano expanded health care benefits to all domestic partners of government employees, gay or straight. The next year, Brewer passed House Bill 2013 in the midst of a state budget crisis, which revoked health care benefits to domestic partners and children still on their parents' plan. However, the law was only enforced on homosexual domestic partners, and came into effect in January 2011. Arizona <a href = "/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">banned same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report argues that the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), established by <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official website] in 2010 to address allegations of human rights violations during the last months of the war, is ineffective in nearly every way and does not meet international standards on national commissions of inquiry. Instead, AI contends that the LLRC exists merely to "deflect international pressure and silence internal critics." According the the report, the commission has failed to investigate witness testimony that would help to establish the identities of perpetrators as well as failed to protect the witnesses from threats and retaliation. In addition to addressing these shortcomings, AI desires an independent investigation for two other reasons, which it deems crucial:<blockquote>(1) to protect the global principle of accountability for international crimes, and prevent the establishment of a negative precedent for other states that may emulate Sri Lanka's attempt to flout international law so egregiously; and (2) to help the process of reconciliation inside Sri Lanka through findings issued by a neutral outside body free of perceptions of bias, that can establish the truth and provide justice for the crimes committed by all sides to the conflict, including the LTTE, government forces and their affiliates.</blockquote>Amnesty International's Asia Pacific Director warned that the international community "must not be deceived into viewing the LLRC as a credible replacement for an international inquiry" and that this is the only way the "process of post-conflict reconciliation [can] begin to move forward."

<p>AI has not been the only organization to criticize the conduct of the Sri Lankan government in handling affairs related to the war. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hrw-sri-lanka-report-on-civil-war-whitewashes-military-atrocities.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] a report released by the Sri Lankan government for not taking responsibility for alleged violations of the laws of war. The <a href="http://www.defence.lk/english.asp">Sri Lankan Ministry of Defense</a> [official website] released its report entitled, "Humanitarian Operation Factual Analysis", where for the first time it admitted that the military caused civilian deaths near the end of the civil war. The report detailed numerous alleged abuses of LTTE against civilians including using them as human shields. Sri Lanka says it took reasonable steps to avoid civilian casualties. <a href="http://www.defence.lk/main_abt.asp?fname=SoD">Secretary of Defence Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], in releasing the report said: "The false claims and allegations made by Tamil Diaspora together with the LTTE international network will be laid to rest with the release of the factual analysis reports." Still, HRW criticized the report for its lack of discussion over the military's responsibility for alleged war crimes such as "frequent indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas" and summary executions of LTTE fighters. Brad Adams, Asia director at HRW, said: "The Sri Lankan government is finally admitting that its forces caused civilians losses during the conflict's final months, but unconvincingly claims no responsibility. This is just the latest and glossiest effort to whitewash mounting evidence of government atrocities during the fighting." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit was filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] in July 2008 under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text], with the court asked to determine whether the public interest goals of the FOIA outweighed the privacy concerns of disclosing the information. The DOJ supported its argument against disclosure by citing Exemption 7(C), which states that "records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes" may be withheld "to the extent that disclosure could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." However, the court found that because the privacy interests defendants retain regarding the facts of their convictions or public guilty pleas fall on the lower end of the spectrum, disclosure of facts so related does not constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy, making Exemption 7(C) inapplicable. Additionally, the court supported its decision by distinguishing it from cases that resulted in more extensive disclosures with Judge Merrick Garland writing:<blockquote>In this case, however, disclosure will reveal only the "bits" not the "whole." As already discussed, the most that disclosure is likely to lead to is the fact of a single conviction, not a comprehensive scorecard of a person's entire criminal history across multiple jurisdictions. Nor is there a web of statutory or regulatory policies obscuring that information, nor much expense nor logistical difficulty in gathering it.</blockquote>The court's decision affirmed in part that of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], which also held that disclosure of information related to cases in which persons were convicted or entered public guilty pleas was appropriate given the lower privacy interests. However, the appeals court remanded the issue of whether disclosure is appropriate in cases involving individuals who were acquitted or whose cases were dismissed or sealed.

<p>The ACLU is not finished with its investigation into how governments use cell phone location data to track criminal suspects. Last month the group announced that their affiliates were sending <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-probing-31-state-law-enforcement-agencies-on-cell-phone-tracking-procedures.php">approximately 375 requests for information</a> [JURIST report] in 31 states to reveal how law enforcement uses location data tracking on cell phones. Most jurisdictions have never encountered cell phone tracking as a legal question, so police are generally not required to obtain a warrant. The ACLU is demanding a review of information from each targeted department, including: if probable cause warrants are obtained to access cell phone location data, statistics on how frequently law enforcement gathers this data, how much money is being spent on cell phone tracking, and any other policies or procedures used to acquire cell phone location data. The ACLU also supports the <a href="http://wyden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=b29a3450-f722-4571-96f0-83c8ededc332">Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act</a> [materials], introduced to Congress in June, which would require government agencies to obtain a probable cause warrant before seeking location data. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court explained its standard of review in evaluating Khan's appeal:<blockquote>Whether a detainee was "part of" an associated force is a mixed question of law and fact. That is, whether a detainee's alleged conduct is sufficient to make him "part of" a force and whether the alleged connections between that force and al Qaeda and/or the Taliban are sufficient to render it an "associated force" are legal questions that we review de novo. Whether the government has proven that conduct and those connections, however, are factual questions that we review for clear error.</blockquote>After a lengthy analysis of evidence and the district court's findings, the appeals court found that there was no clear error of law or fact and affirmed the denial of Khan's petition.

<p>Last September, Judge John Bates of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1101-236">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF]  that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-allows-indefinite-detention-of-guantanamo-detainee.php">US government can indefinitely hold Khan</a> [JURIST report] at the detention facility in Guantanamo. Lawyers for Khan have argued that he was a shopkeeper in Kandahar and not involved with fighting against American forces. They contended that Khan was captured by corrupt Afghans who turned him over to American forces and lied about his involvement with insurgents. The defense also presented evidence that HIG had no presence in the Kandahar region when Khan was captured. The case against Khan relies heavily on intelligence concurrently gathered by US intelligence collectors through several informants, some of whom are disaffected members of HIG. According to the court's opinion, such intelligence ultimately led to a decision by US military officials to neutralize the HIG cell, including the execution of an operation to capture Khan at his shop. The operation was a success, and Khan's home and shop were searched after his arrest, yielding a variety of physical evidence in the form of notebooks and letters. Heavily redacted classified intelligence reports state that the search of Khan's properties uncovered further, particularly incriminating evidence that confirmed his role in the Kandahar HIG cell.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The high court <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg11-055en.html">ruled</a> [press release] that by voting through national acts that implement the broader European measures, the Bundestag, the national <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/index.html">Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany</a> [official website], did not unconstitutionally impair its own ability to adopt and control the nation's budget, nor did it infringe on the budget autonomy of future parliaments. The court's approval of the Monetary Union Financial Stabilisation Act, which authorizes the aid for Greece, and the Act instituting the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/efsm/index_en.htm">European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism</a> (EFSM) [materials], was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hYAIpQJp3n4fY7GWDl1Il8a2B02A?docId=CNG.f1f5b8b061501ede51979a1e1f42063a.5a1">welcomed by euro zone nations</a> [AFP report] and the European Commission, and hailed by German <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BK/En/Angela-Merkel/angela-merkel.html">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website] as validation of her much criticized euro zone policy. Additionally, share prices across Europe markets soared following the court's announcement, with German stocks peaking at a rise of more then three percent.

<p>In May of last year the German constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/german-high-court-rejects-temporary-injunction-for-greece-bailout-funds.php">refused to issue a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report]  against the German government's &#8364;22.4 billion ($28.5 billion) contribution to the bailout package for Greece, which has been gripped by a dire <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8508136.stm">debt crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] and faces severe austerity measures as it grapples with its debt. The court held that the complainants seeking the injunction did not produce any concrete evidence that their rights under Germany's Basic Law could be "seriously and irreversibly" affected as a result of the guaranteed loan. The court's press release also noted that potential liability risk as a result of the contribution is outweighed by reducing the risks of damaging Germany's national economy as a result of instability of the European Monetary Union. The EU and <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website] announced the initial &#8364;110 billion bailout package for Greece earlier that month, and it was subsequently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8669488.stm">approved by euro zone leaders</a> [BBC report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

To support this contention, the report cites to US policies regarding indefinite military detention for terrorism suspects, the use of torture on terrorism suspects and enemy combatants, racial and religious profiling, and domestic surveillance and wiretapping.  The report posits that these policies run deeper than what is known by the American people, civil liberties continue to be violated in secret and that future violations are imminent. The report calls upon US citizens to demand national security measures that do not encroach upon civil liberties and to urge government leaders to put an end to policies and programs that do not align themselves with these values:<blockquote>We look to our leaders and our institutions, our courts and our Congress, to guide us towards a better way, and it is now up to the American people to demand that our leaders respond to national security challenges with our values, our unity&#8212;and yes, our courage&#8212;intact.  Our country is strong.  And it is our fundamental values that are the very foundation of our strength and security.</blockquote>The ACLU acknowledged that the government has sought to cease certain questionable practices, citing President Barack Obama's directive to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">close the Guantanamo Bay military prison</a> [JURIST news report], but stated that other questionable practices remain "core elements of [US] national security strategy today."

<p>One practice that the ACLU report criticized was the government's practice of using cell phone location data to track individuals suspected of terroristic or criminal acts  The ACLU is currently involved in litigation and investigations pertaining to requests for information filed under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] regarding the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a>'s (DOJ) [official website] use of this practice. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-orders-doj-to-disclose-cell-phone-tracking-case-information.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the DOJ to disclose docket information in certain cases, finding that privacy concerns did not outweigh the public interest goals of the FOIA. Last month the group announced that their affiliates were sending <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-probing-31-state-law-enforcement-agencies-on-cell-phone-tracking-procedures.php">approximately 375 requests for information</a> [JURIST report] in 31 states to reveal how law enforcement uses location data tracking on cell phones. Most jurisdictions have never encountered cell phone tracking as a legal question, so police are generally not required to obtain a warrant. The ACLU is demanding a review of information from each targeted department, including: if probable cause warrants are obtained to access cell phone location data, statistics on how frequently law enforcement gathers this data, how much money is being spent on cell phone tracking, and any other policies or procedures used to acquire cell phone location data. The ACLU also supports the <a href="http://wyden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=b29a3450-f722-4571-96f0-83c8ededc332">Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act</a> [materials], introduced to Congress in June, which would require government agencies to obtain a probable cause warrant before seeking location data.<br />

The independent inquiry was led by retired judge William Gage and focused on the detention of 10 Iraqis arrested at a hotel in 2003 on suspicion of insurgency. One man, Baha Mousa, died in custody from what was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEr_5gAfX66kmiGulgGRzNQ2BuHg?docId=CNG.94ba3b4dec5c0a90ff564448b4357a1f.351">concluded</a> [AFP report] to be a combination of soldier-inflicted injuries and a generally weakened state resulting from his detention. Mousa and the other Iraqi detainees were hooded, handcuffed and held in stress positions by the British soldiers and were subjected to a series of violent assaults. Mousa, a father of two, served as the hotel's receptionist and died about 36 hours after being detained, sustaining 93 separate injuries including fractured ribs and a broken nose. Although the use of hooding and painful stress positions was banned by the British government in 1972, Gage found a lack of knowledge of this prohibition, which he reportedly blamed on "corporate failure" by the UK's <a href="http://www.mod.uk/defenceinternet/home">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) [official website]. The report also accused other soldiers of having knowledge of the abuse but not the "moral courage" to report the incidents.

<p>The UK <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/uk-announces-public-inquiry-into-2003.php">announced the public inquiry</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 after the nine other Iraqis alleged torture at the hands of British troops and sued the MOD for damages. <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/uk-court-drops-last-abuse-charges.php">Charges were dropped</a> in 2007 against six British soldiers accused of involvement with Mousa's death, but one accused soldier, Corporal David Payne, <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/uk-soldier-first-to-plead-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in 2006 to a charge of inhumane treatment, becoming the first British soldier to admit commission of a war crime in Iraq. The corporal was singled out in Thursday's report as conducting the final violent assault on Mousa before the prisoner died. Although he pleaded guilty to inhumane treatment of the detainees, Payne pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and perverting the course of justice. A UN report released just last month analyzed the current human rights situation in Iraq and confirmed that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/iraq-human-rights-abuses-continue-un-report.php">human rights abuses in the country continue</a> [JURIST report] despite the drawdown of foreign troops, such as in 2010 when <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that Iraqi detainees were being <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">repeatedly tortured</a> [JURIST report] in a secret prison in Baghdad.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> (ACLUFL) [advocacy website] on Wednesday filed a federal <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/pdfs/ACLUTANFComplaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/index.cfm?action=viewRelease&emailAlertID=3946">press release</a>] seeking to enjoin implementation of the recently passed state law that mandates drug testing for individuals seeking Temporary Cash Assistance (TAC). The lawsuit was filed in the <a href="http://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Florida</a> [official website] on behalf of a class led by Luis Lebron, a 35-year-old Orlando resident, Navy veteran and full time University of Central Florida student who applied for TAC to help support his four-year-old son. Lebron meets all the criteria for aid but refused to submit to the drug test on the principle that it is an infringement of his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. In effect since July 1, the <a href="http://leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0414/Sections/0414.0652.html">new law</a> [Fla Stat 414.0652 text] was signed by <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] at the end of May and requires applicants for welfare benefits under the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/tanf/index.html">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families</a> (TANF) [official website] program to submit to and fund a urinalysis for substance screening. Individuals who pass receive reimbursement for the cost of the test, and those who fail lose their TANF benefits for one year. The ACLU complaint notes that the Supreme Court has held that suspicionless drug testing by the government is an unreasonable search that violates the Fourth Amendment, the only exceptions being for substantial public safety concerns and students in the public school system. TANF is a federal block grant program passed under 1996 welfare reform legislation aimed at turning welfare into a temporary assistance program.

<p>The ACLUFL <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-aclu-challenges-mandatory-drug-screening-of-state-employees-applicants.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in June challenging Scott's executive order mandating state agencies to enact pre-employment drug screening for all prospective employees and provide for random drug testing of all current agency employees regardless of classification. The governor issued <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2011/11-58-testing.pdf">Executive Order 11-58</a> [text, PDF] in March and directed the drug testing policy to go into effect by May 21, 2011. The challenge was brought on behalf of a public employees union representing 50,000 public workers affected by the order. In the complaint, the ACLUFL argued that the order violates both the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable governmental searches and case law stating that drug-testing without suspicion is unreasonable except under certain circumstances, such as when employees are involved in "safety-sensitive" positions. Special counsel for the union also argued that the order unfairly singles out public workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday upheld a ruling that juveniles convicted of murder <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200913267.pdf">may be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole</a> [opinion, PDF]. Kenneth Loggins was convicted of brutally murdering a hitchhiker in 1994, when he was 17 years old, and was originally sentenced to death. However, in 2006 his sentence was lessened to life imprisonment without parole, after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in <span class="casename">Roper v. Simmons</span> that juveniles convicted of murder <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/breaking-news-supreme-court-strikes.php">could not receive the death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. Loggins appealed the lesser sentence, arguing that sentencing juveniles to life in prison without parole is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt8_user.html#amdt8_hd8">cruel and unusual punishment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text]. However, the court disagreed:<blockquote>As required by Alabama law, at his resentencing Loggins was mandatorily sentenced to life without parole the same as if it had been the maximum and only sentence prescribed for him and his crime from the beginning. The issue, then, is whether it is unconstitutional to sentence a defendant who committed a murder while he was a juvenile to a mandatory sentence of life without parole. Loggins claims that it is, but he has not cited a single decision of any federal court that even comes close to holding that...Given the absence of any support for Loggins' claims about the mandatory nature of the life without parole sentence imposed on him and given the presence of Supreme Court decisions strongly indicating that his claims have no merit, he has failed to carry his burden of establishing that no fairminded jurist could agree with the Alabama courts' rejection of those claims.</blockquote>The appellate judges said that, despite the <span class="casename">Roper</span> decision, a juvenile may still be convicted of a "capital offense" and given the strictest sentence allowed under state law, as long as it is not the death penalty. 

<p>Other states also permit sentencing juveniles to life imprisonment without parole. Last November, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/aclu-suing-michigan-over-life-sentences-for-juveniles.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] against Michigan government officials, claiming that state's juvenile sentencing laws allowing life imprisonment without parole were unconstitutional. According to the ACLU, the US is the only country to sentence children to life in prison without parole. In May 2010, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-strikes-down-life-sentences-for-juveniles-facing-non-homicide-charges.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-7412">Graham v. Florida</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment prohibits the imprisonment of a juvenile for life without the possibility of parole as punishment for the juvenile's commission of a non-homicide offense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court had <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/malaysia-court-agrees-to-hear-indigenous-land-rights-suit.php">agreed to hear the suit</a> [JURIST report] in March. The ruling caps a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gwfKtrvS6uaEShvq7cGjeA6ay4nQ?docId=19206e4a93bb4d5db6359e138b7b604c">more than decade-long legal battle</a> [AP report] which began when the Sarawak government started seizing land in 1997. Almost USD $2.3 billion has been spent on the Bakun Dam project which has created a reservoir approximately 260 square miles large. Two of the judges refused to answer whether the seizure was unconstitutional and instead dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the issues "were not raised or properly canvassed before the court." The judges stated that if the plaintiffs were not satisfied with the amount of compensation then that is a matter for arbitration, not for the court. The third judge dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the seizure was constitutional. The <a href="http://www.coac.org.my/codenavia/portals/coacv2/code/main/main.php?parentID=0">Center for Orang Asli Concerns</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=247923515251582">expressed disappointment in the ruling</a> [press release]. Counsel for the plaintiffs were disappointed that the constitutional issues were not resolved, but looked forward to resolving the issues in future suits. There are currently more than 100 unresolved land rights suits filed by indigenous people in Malaysia's lower courts.

<p>In December, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-pledges-support-for-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">pledged to support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [JURIST report], a non-binding UN treaty expressing support for the rights of indigenous peoples. The US was the last member to lend its support to the treaty. In August 2010, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called on governments to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-calls-for-greater-efforts-on-indigenous-rights.php">improve the living conditions of indigenous peoples</a> [JURIST report] and support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The investigation, which began in June 2008, uncovered the PRPD use of excessive and unreasonable force, failure to protect First Amendment rights and unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests. In its <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/prpd_exec_summ.pdf">executive summary report</a> [PDF], the DOJ acknowledged that the rights violations corresponded with a period of increased crime and pressure on the PRPD. However, such circumstances did not excuse the misconduct:<blockquote>[I]ncreasing crime cannot be used to justify continued civil rights violations or the failure to implement meaningful reforms. Constitutional policing and effective law enforcement are inextricably bound. Public safety depends on the trust and cooperation of the community, which in turn depends on constitutional police practices that respect civil rights. Our previous efforts in working with large police departments strongly suggest that by addressing the civil rights concerns we raise in this report, the Commonwealth will not only meet its constitutional duty, but also reduce crime, improve public safety, and increase community confidence.</blockquote>The DOJ also identified the PRPD's failure to report or investigate allegations of sex crimes and domestic violence, as well as police discrimination against Dominican individuals. The DOJ aims to work with the PRPD and the <a href="http://www2.pr.gov/prgovEN/Pages/default.aspx">Commonwealth of Puerto Rico</a> [official website] to eliminate unlawful police behavior and create more transparency and accountability for law enforcement.

<p>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] in March <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/aclu-urges-doj-action-on-puerto-rico-rights-violations.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the DOJ to take action against the government of Puerto Rico for alleged civil rights violations. In a letter addressed to Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, the ACLU asked the DOJ to conclude its investigation into rights abuses <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Human_Rights_Crisis_in_Puerto_Rico_-_ACLU_re-edited_March_7_2011.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.aclu-pr.org/EN/Home.htm">ACLU of Puerto Rico</a> [advocacy website] since 2008 and publish a report of its findings. It also urged the DOJ to intervene to provide remedies to end the alleged police abuses which included: violence against student protesters; the fabrication of drug-related charges against over a 100 individuals in the city of Mayaguez; the violent and inhumane eviction of members of the Villas del Sol squatter community, including the denial of fresh water to the community for eight months; the de-certification of the <a href="http://www.capr.org/">Puerto Rico Bar Association</a> [official website, in Spanish] and other actions to stifle dissent. Residents of Puerto Rico, an unincorporated US territory, are US citizens and have the same federal <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] rights in relation to the island's government as a mainland US citizen would have against a state government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The whereabouts of Gaddafi and Abdullah al-Sanussi are currently unknown.

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since February. Last month, Libyan Prime Minister Al Baghdad Ali Al-Mahmoudi requested that the UN create a "high-level commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">investigate alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website]. Though NATO was mandated by the UN to use force in order to stop Muammar from fomenting violence upon Libyan citizens, the campaign has allegedly gone beyond the scope of protecting civilians and recently led to the death of 85 civilians in one night after NATO forces bombed a residential area supposedly housing a rebel command center. In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">after it published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaclu.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://acluofnc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina Legal Foundation</a> (ACLU-NCLF) [advocacy website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/files/ACLU%20v.%20Conti%20-%20Verified%20Complaint.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the federal district court for the Eastern District of North Carolina challenging a North Carolina state law authorizing the use of pro-life license plates as a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. In June, the North Carolina <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/">General Assembly</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/billlookup/billlookup.pl?Session=2011&BillID=H289">bill</a> [HB 289 materials] authorizing the issuance of "Choose Life" license plates, but failed to authorize the use of license plates stating, "Trust Women. Respect Choice," or "Respect Choice," which would indicate advocacy of reproductive rights. The ACLU-NCLF alleges that allowing pro-life proponents to express their views through the use of license plates while denying the same right to pro-choice proponents is discriminatory and in violation of the First Amendment. Katherine Lewis Parker, the Legal Director of the ACLU-NCLF, indicated that the law is being challenged because of its <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/?q=aclu-nc-files-lawsuit-challenging-discriminatory-license-plate-scheme">inhibitions on freedom of speech</a> [statement] and not because of the abortion position advocated by the license plates, stating:<blockquote>This is a basic issue of freedom of speech and fairness. It is a fundamental tenet of the First Amendment that the State cannot use its authority to promote one side of a debate while denying the same opportunity to the other side. Anyone who supports freedom of speech should agree with this stance, regardless of one's position on abortion. Our position would be the same if the State had authorized a pro-choice license plate but not an anti-choice alternative. In that situation, the ACLU-NCLF would be suing on behalf of anti-choice drivers under the exact same theory of viewpoint discrimination.</blockquote>The complaint asks the court declare the current law unconstitutional and to order the state to stop issuing the pro-life license plates without authorizing and issuing a pro-choice plate.  

<p>In addition to the pro-life license plate law, the North Carolina General Assembly also passed <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&BillID=hb854">legislation</a> [HB 854 materials] in June that would require a 24-hour waiting period before receiving an <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive]. The "Woman's Right to Know Act" also requires women seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound of the fetus prior to the procedure. North Carolina <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] the legislation calling it "a dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors." In July, however, both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-house-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">House</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] voted to override the veto, allowing the legislation to become North Carolina law. Opponents of the law have called it "draconian" and have stated that women seeking abortions will face dramatic changes once the law takes effect, while supporters contend that the new law will give women the opportunity to "know all the facts" about abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although France has the right to impose a ban on GM maize, the court stated that France acted illegally by not following proper <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/09/08/uk-eu-court-gmo-idUKTRE7873Y920110908">EU protocol</a> [Reuters report]. In order to impose a ban, EU members must demonstrate that the product poses a serious risk to the environment or human or animal health, and notify the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] authorities of the need to take emergency measures. The GM maize was developed by US biotech giant <a href="http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [corporate website] in 2008. The use of GM organisms, whether through experimentation or cultivation, is governed by EU law.  France issued two orders prohibiting the planting of MON 810 maize seed, which is primarily used to make animal feed resistant to certain parasites. France first banned the product by way of emergency measures in 2007. 

<p>In March, ECJ Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi issued an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ecj-legal-adviser-finds-ban-on-genetically-modified-crops-illegal.php">opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that a French ban on cultivating genetically modified (GM) crops is illegal. France sought to prohibit production of MON 810 within its borders by citing a safeguard clause adopted by the EU in 2004. The clause is designed to allow EU member states to restrict previously approved products in the event that new evidence emerges indicating that the product in question is harmful to either humans or the environment. MON 810 was approved for use by the EU in 1998, and Mengozzi disagreed with applying the clause on the grounds that France imposed its ban without proper European Commission consultation. Though such opinions are not binding, courts typically adopt the stance set forth by advocates general, as the court did here. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Britain introduced the lifetime ban in the 1980s in an effort to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jl_5FUcv7FgkCace7ZB6lzLOGwPw?docId=CNG.94ba3b4dec5c0a90ff564448b4357a1f.6a1">quell the proliferation of HIV and AIDS</a> [AFP report]. Men who have not had sex with another man in over 12 months will be eligible to donate, though men who have had anal or oral sex with another man in the 12 months prior to donating will not be able to donate, regardless of whether they used a condom. Deirdre Kelly, a member of the <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/ab/SaBTO/index.htm">Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs</a> (SaBTO) [official website] review panel, said the repeal would not affect public safety:<blockquote>Around two million individuals generously donate blood every year in the UK to save patients' lives. The SaBTO review examined the best available scientific evidence for UK blood donor selection in relation to sexual behaviours. Our recommendation takes account of new data that have become available since the last review in 2006, as well as scientific and technological advances in the testing of blood. Adherence to the donor selection criteria is vital to maintain the safety of the blood supply, and donors need to be assured that the criteria are evidence-based. We are confident that this change maintains the safety of the blood supply.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/index.asp">NHS Blood and Transplant</a> (NHSBT) [official website] in England and North Wales and the Blood Services of Scotland and Wales will implement the changes on November 7.

<p>Bans on blood donations from homosexual individuals garner much debate. The US <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (DHHS) [official website] in July <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/health&id=8275178">asked experts to review a similar US policy</a> [ABC report] that bars gay men from donating blood. An Ontario <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Superior Court</a> [official website] judge <a href="/paperchase/Freeman%20Decision.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] in September 2010 that the <a href="http://www.blood.ca/">Canadian Blood Services</a> (CBS) is <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-upholds-ban-on-gay-blood-donors.php">justified in prohibiting sexually active gay males from donating blood</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that the CBS discriminates on the basis of health and safety considerations rather than on sexual orientation. In March 2009, a Tasmanian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/australia-court-rules-red-cross-not.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.redcross.org.au/default.asp">Australian Red Cross</a> [organization website] <a href="http://www.donateblood.com.au/faq">policy</a> [text] to refuse blood donations from sexually active homosexual males. Petitioner Michael Cain tried to donate blood in 2004, but his offer was refused after he affirmatively answered an inquiry into whether he "had male-to-male sex" in the past 12 months. The tribunal held that Cain's complaint was unsubstantiated and that the conduct of the Red Cross did not amount to direct or indirect discrimination under the <a href="http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;cond=;doc_id=46%2B%2B1998%2BAT%40EN%2B20090528000000;histon=;prompt=;rec=-1;term=">Anti-Discrimination Act of 1998</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

O'Connor indicated that the task force was being created not to judge or discuss whether the state should have the death penalty, but rather to ensure that the law is "administered in the most fair, efficient, and judicious manner possible." The task force will be chaired by Retired Judge James Brogan of the Ohio Second District Court of Appeals and will include judges, prosecuting attorneys, criminal defense counsel, legislators and academics. O'Connor indicated that the diverse backgrounds of the participants will "ensure that the criteria, laws, and procedures regarding the imposition of the death penalty in Ohio are fair, impartial, and balanced." The task force will be reviewing death penalty laws and procedures from other jurisdictions and analyzing the data and costs associated with those laws. They will also review information included in the American Bar Association's <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/individual_rights/projects/death_penalty_moratorium_implementation_project.html">Death Penalty Moratorium Implementation Project</a> [materials] in order to "identify areas in need of action and recommend the course of action." 

<p>In December 2010, the Ohio Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ohio-supreme-court-rejects-challeng-to-lethal-injection-method.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the lethal injection method of execution and indicated that they would not hear further cases regarding lethal injection until the Ohio <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/">General Assembly</a> [official website] explicitly expanded state review of death penalty cases. In November 2009, Ohio adopted a <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">single-drug lethal injection protocol</a> [JURIST report], replacing the previously used three-drug method. The single-drug lethal injection method has faced numerous challenges, with one case reaching the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. In March 2010, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution of an Ohio inmate challenging the state's single-drug execution protocol. Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">conducted its first execution</a> [JURIST report] using the new procedure in December 2009. The change in procedure came after the state <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">undertook a review</a> [JURIST report] of its lethal injection practices in September 2009, following the planned execution of inmate Romell Broom failed when a suitable vein for the drugs' administration could not be found. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/111057.P.pdf">Virginia v. Sebelius</a> [opinion, PDF], the court held that Virginia lacked standing to sue and vacated the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">judgment of the district court</a> [JURIST report], remanding the case with instructions to dismiss the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Circuit Judge Diana Gribbon Motz wrote:<blockquote>[T]he lack of factual context here impedes analysis of the underlying constitutional disputes. For example, both parties premise their Commerce Clause arguments on their competing characterizations of what the individual mandate regulates. A number of factors might affect the validity of these characterizations, including a taxpayer's current possession of health insurance, current or planned future consumption of health care, or other related voluntary action. The case at hand lacks the concrete factual context critical to a proper analysis of these issues.</blockquote>In <a href="http://coop.ca4.uscourts.gov/pdf/102347.P.pdf">Liberty University v. Geithner</a> [opinion, PDF], the court ruled that the suit was filed prematurely, also vacating the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report], which had declared the act constitutional.

<p>Although the Fourth Circuit dismissed the case without deciding the constitutionality of PPACA, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] may eventually rule on the issue. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">struck down the individual mandate</a> [JURIST report] as unconstitutional, creating a circuit split. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the law</a> in June, and that ruling was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?568366954">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website]. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by a physician organization for lack of standing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The initiative, <a href="http://www.sos.ms.gov/page.aspx?s=7&s1=1&s2=50">Measure 26</a> [materials], would amend the Mississippi Constitution to define the word "person" or "persons" to include "every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the functional equivalent thereof." Two Mississippi citizens filed the lawsuit after it was qualified, claiming the initiative violated <a href="http://www.iandrinstitute.org/New%20IRI%20Website%20Info/I&R%20Research%20and%20History/I&R%20at%20the%20Statewide%20Level/Constitution%20and%20Statutes/Mississippi.pdf">Article 15, Section 273(5)(a)</a> [text, PDF] of the Mississippi Constitution. The court refused to rule on the constitutionality of the initiative itself, but concluded that it could not interfere with or question the validity of a legislative proposal prior to the election. The court, therefore, ultimately dismissed the challenge on the basis that Measure 26 is not ripe for review. The Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.aclu-ms.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] Nsombi Lambright expressed her discontent with the ruling and called on voters to reject the measure:<blockquote>We're disappointed with the ruling. A measure will be on the ballot that will allow the government to dictate what is a private matter that's best decided by a woman, her family and within the context of her faith. Mississippi voters should reject this intrusive and dangerous measure.</blockquote> <a href="http://www.personhoodusa.com/">Personhood USA</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.personhoodusa.com/press-release/personhood-mississippi-wins-supreme-court-battle-ready-voters-november">praised the ruling</a> [press release], saying "Mississippians volunteered thousands of hours of their time to ensure that voters would have the right to vote on this prolife amendment."

<p>Colorado voters <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_16506253">struck down</a> [<em>Denver Post</em> report] a similar <a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/LCS/Initiative%20Referendum/0910InitRefr.nsf/0/ed0d797d3ffe6fb0872576f5005c1efd/$FILE/Amendment%2062%20FinalDraftCombined.pdf">ballot initiative</a> [text, PDF] in November 2010 that would have amended the state's <a href="http://law.justia.com/colorado/constitution/index.html">constitution</a> [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">extend rights to fetuses</a> [JURIST report] and would have effectively outlawed <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive]. In November 2007, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.co.us/Courts/Supreme_Court/Index.cfm">Colorado Supreme Court</a> [official website] approved the language of an anti-abortion group's proposed ballot initiative that <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/colorado-high-court-oks-ballot.php">would amend the Colorado constitution</a> [JURIST report] to define a fertilized egg as a "person" entitled to "inalienable rights, equality of justice, and due process of law" under the state constitution. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty-staff/cborgmann.html">Caitlin Borgmann</a> argues that redefining personhood is just <a href="/forum/2011/05/caitlin-borgmann-constitutional-reproductive-rights.php">one of several approaches aimed at curtailing abortion</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report states that up to 70 people have been killed since August, and, in order to stop cycles of violence, local authorities must work to address the underlying issues. The report also describes the recent actions of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/africa/boko-haram/p25739">Boko Haram</a> [CFR backgrounder] in <a href="http://www.voanews.com/learningenglish/home/world/Boko-Haram-Claims-Nigeria-Attack-128490388.html">bombing a UN building in Nigeria</a> [VO report] last month as "cowardly." At least 18 people died in the attack. Spokesperson Rupert Colville said:<blockquote>We encourage the authorities at national and local levels to take effective preventative measures against such violence, including by curbing hate-speech and working with civil society, including human rights NGOs, religious leaders and academic institutions, to attempt reconciliation between the various communities. It is of utmost importance that justice is done and is seen to be done by prosecuting the alleged perpetrators of violence and ensuring remedies for victims and their families.</blockquote>Colville also stressed that "security forces must ... act in full compliance with the law."

<p>Corruption in the Nigerian government has further inflamed ethnic rivalries. In August <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nigeria-anti-corruption-agency-ineffective-hrw.php">corruption in the Nigerian government has become endemic</a> [JURIST report]. The group criticized <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12192152">President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile] and Nigeria's anti-corruption agency. Earlier that month a Nigerian official <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/nigeria-official-calls-for-special-corruption-court.php">called for the creation of a special anti-corruption court</a> [JURIST report] because corruption cases in the regular courts were taking too long to process. Nigeria's outgoing speaker of the House of Representatives was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/nigeria-anti-corruption-agency-arrests-outgoing-house-speaker-on-fraud-allegations.php">arrested in June</a> [JURIST report] on allegations of fraud. In April the Chief Prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icc-prosecutor-to-investigate-nigeria-post-election-violence.php">announced an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into ethnic violence that broke out following the most recent national election. After Jonathan, from the predominantly Christian south, defeated the challenger <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6192919.stm">Muhammadu Buhari</a> [BBC profile], from the predominantly Muslim north, riots ensued, resulting in the death of over 100 people and the displacement of more than 40,000. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.1892:">Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> [HR 1892 materials] passed the House with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/house-passes-intelligence-authorization-bill-for-fiscal-2012/2011/09/09/gIQAv1jJFK_story.html">overwhelming bipartisan support</a> [Washington Post report] after after receiving a memo from the White House objecting to two provisions, including one that would have made the administration give State Department cables related to the transfer of detainees and other potentially sensitive information to the committees. The White House also objected to a provision requiring the Senate to confirm the director of the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> [official website], citing concerns that the position may remain unfilled for longer than necessary as a result of the difficulty involved in obtaining such a confirmation. The bill would also require a report on the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. It must still be approved by the Senate before being sent to the President. However, leaders of the House and Senate have already met to work out differences between their respective bills. 

<p>US intelligence-related activities have been controversial. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] ruled that former defense secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-allows-US-intelligence-officers-suit-against-rumsfeld.php">can be sued</a> [JURIST report] by a former US military contractor who claims he was tortured while imprisoned in Iraq. The man, whose identity remains concealed and who worked in Iraq as an intelligence officer, said the US military accused him of passing information to the enemy and abducted and tortured him without formally charging him with a crime under orders from Rumsfeld. Upon release and return to the US, the former intelligence officer filed a suit demanding compensation for property lost and rights violated. This is the second time Rumsfeld, currently represented by the Justice Department, has been allowed to be sued personally in a torture case. The other suit, which Rumsfeld is now appealing, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-allows-rumsfeld-torture.php">allowed last year</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-files-antitrust-suit-to-block-att-t-mobile-merger.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] last month attempting to block AT&#38;T's proposed $39 billion acquisition of cellular carrier <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/Company/">T-Mobile USA</a> [corporate website], citing the important role T-Mobile has played in keeping prices down by creating pressure on the other large carriers, including not only AT&#38;T, but also <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/">Verizon Wireless</a> and <a href="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint Nextel</a> [corporate websites]. In its response to the suit, AT&#38;T argued that acquiring T-Mobile will allow it to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/t-defends-t-mobile-deal-response-doj-suit-221644241.html">provide better services to its customers</a> [AP report] as a result of the expansion of its mobile network. In addition, AT&#38;T contends that smaller, regional carriers will act as alternatives to consumers and thus not allow the market to be completely dominated by itself, Verizon and Sprint. The case is set to be heard on September 21.

<p>The worldwide consolidation of media is an ongoing global concern. In August, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-major-publishers-of-collusion.php">class action lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.apple.com/startpage/">Apple</a> [corporate website] and five major publishers for allegedly colluding to illegally fix electronic book (e-book) prices. Communication Director for Free Press, Dave Saldana <a href="/hotline/2011/07/dave-saldana-news-corp.php">argued last July</a> [JURIST Op-ed] that the proposed AT&#38;T/T-Mobile deal is an example of the enormous influence giant media corporations can bring to bear through massive public relations blitzes and the acquisition of political influence through the pouring of money into lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. He said that it is as a result of exactly these kinds of efforts, that AT&#38;T remains confident that its T-Mobile purchase will go through, "because it knows it has several hundred million reasons to push for the merger, and millions of means to get it." He warned that media consolidation is dangerous because it gives the companies leverage to sway public opinion and dominate the narrative when their own practices are questioned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1249:">America Invents Act</a> [HR 1249 materials], sponsored by Congressman <a href="http://lamarsmith.house.gov/">Lamar Smith</a> (R) [official website], proposes significant changes to the current US patent system. One of these would result in the conversion from a system of "first to invent" to a system of "first to file", a change which Congress supports because of its belief that it will "promote the progress of science" as well as promote the "harmonization" of the US patent system with those used in nearly all other countries. Additionally, the Act would alter the way funds are allocated to the Patent Office and the way patents that are granted, but later contested, are handled in an attempt to cut down on costly legal disputes. The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-house-approves-patent-reform-bill.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in June. The bill will proceed to President Barack Obama, who has indicated that <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/24/technology/patent_reform_bill/">he will sign it into law</a> [CNN report].

<p>There have been several significant legal decisions in patent law in the last few months. In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] unanimously ruled against <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> [corporate website], holding that a patent will be invalidated only if the challenging party meets the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules-against-microsoft-in-patent-infringement-case.php">"clear and convincing evidence" standard</a> [JURIST report]. The court also held in a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-supreme-court-rules-in-case-over-stanfords-rights-to-hiv-testing-invention.php">separate decision</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/usc_sup_01_35_10_II_20_18.html">Bayh-Doyle Act</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 200-212], which vests patent rights to universities for inventions from federally funded research, did not give <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> [academic website] superior rights to the invention of its employee and thus, the employee could transfer his invention rights to a third party. In May, the Supreme Court ruled that induced patent infringement <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-in-patent-infringement-case.php">requires knowledge</a> [JURIST report] that the induced acts constitute patent infringement. Also in May, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] restricted the use of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-restricts-inequitable-conduct-defense-for-patent-law.php">"inequitable conduct" defense</a> [JURIST report] for invalidating patents. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban proposed the establishment of a three-month United Nations Support Mission in Libya, which would focus on "further defining the needs and wishes of Libya for United Nations support, while delivering urgent advice and assistance."  Specifically, the mission would include assistance and support to national efforts regarding the restoration of public security, promotion of national reconciliation and political dialogue, restoration of public services, protection of human rights, economic recovery and coordination of support from other actors.  Ban emphasized the importance of reconciliation and recovery in Libya as well as the importance of UN support stating:
<blockquote>In the past few weeks, we have witnessed dramatic and historic events in Libya.  There can no longer be any doubt regarding the yearning of so many Libyans for fundamental change, human dignity and freedom.  [The new Libyan authorities] have clearly requested the assistance of the United Nations and the international community in this process.  The time has come for Libyans to begin walking the path of reconciliation and recovery.  It is important that the international community be ready to support the Libyan people.</blockquote>
The UNSC <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39497&Cr=libya&Cr1=">announced</a> [press release] on Friday that it has begun discussion regarding Ban's proposal.  Ban's Special Adviser for Post-Conflict Planning in Libya, Ian Martin, visited the country for five days last week and reported to the UNSC that the country would benefit from Ban's proposal. Martin indicated in a subsequent press conference that the UNSC was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/un-chief-asks-security-council-for-3-month-mission-in-libya/2011/09/09/gIQAf2eIFK_story.html">supportive of the proposed mission</a> [AP report] and would circulate a draft resolution on Monday. 

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since February.  On Thursday, Chief Prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile], announced that he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/icc-requests-help-from-interpol-to-locate-gaddafi.php">seeking assistance</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.interpol.int/default.asp">INTERPOL</a> [official website] in order to locate and arrest former Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>]. The ICC previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi, his son and his brother-in law.  Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-in-talks-with-libya-rebels-to-hand-over-gaddafi-son-for-prosecution.php">allegedly captured</a> [JURIST report] last month, though he reported to foreign media that he will continue fighting.  Last month, Libyan Prime Minister Al Baghdad Ali Al-Mahmoudi requested that the UN create a "high-level commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">investigate alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website]. In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision vacates a ruling handed down by a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit in July <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-finds-michigan-affirmative-action-ban-unconstitutional.php">finding the proposal unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The panel ruled that the proposal unduly burdened minorities by abusing a political process where minorities were likely to have no redress. Michigan <a href="http://michigan.gov/ag">Attorney General Bill Schuette</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/michigan-ag-appeals-decision-overturning-affirmative-action-ban.php">made a formal request for a rehearing</a> [JURIST report] in July stating that the decision conflicted with prior decisions of the court.

At the Southern African Chief Justices Forum in Kampala, Odoki <a href="http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1233650/-/bjam4yz/-/index.html">pointed to surveys</a> [<em>Daily Monitor</em> report] by the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> and the <a href="http://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum</a> [official websites] that rank African countries below other countries with respect to judicial independence. Odoki claims the government's refusal to enforce court decisions and recent attacks on the courts are further indicators of the government's intrusion. Odoki also suggested that inadequate allocation of resources to the judiciary undermine the judiciary's power in relation to the other branches of government. The Chief Justice ultimately called on African governments to make the Judiciary a priority in budget matters.

<p>Judicial independence has been a long-standing issue in Uganda. In March 2007, Ugandan judges initiated a <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/uganda-judges-strike-to-protest.php">week-long general strike</a> [JURIST report] to protest the siege of the High Court and seizure of defendants by government forces. The judicial strike came in response to a siege of the Ugandan High Court where security agents surrounded the building and arrested six supporters of opposition leader <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1191395.stm">Kizza Besiyge</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/besigye.php">news archive</a>] who had been charged with treason but released on bail. The agents beat the suspects and pistol-whipped their lawyer unconscious with a rifle butt, according to witnesses. <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1196167.stm">Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/uganda-president-denounces-court.php">criticized</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/international-brief-ugandan-court.php">Constitutional Court ruling</a> [JURIST reports] that halted the court-martial of Besigye on charges of possessing illegal firearms. Museveni vowed to fight the court ruling politically, even suggesting that a referendum may be used. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icj.org/">International Commission of Jurists</a> [advocacy website] has since <a href="http://www.icj.org/dwn/database/Uganda-PR-02032007.pdf">criticized</a> [press release] the government for interfering with judicial independence by intimidating lawyers and judges with armed agents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In November 2008, Germany <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/143/14925.pdf?PHPSESSID=419a000f8e769bfe604a9368c1929677">filed a lawsuit</a> [ICJ press release, PDF] against Italy in the ICJ in a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/germany-files-icj-suit-against-italy-to.php">bid to block new claims</a> [JURIST report] for personal damages resulting from Nazi actions in World War II. Germany is arguing that an October 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-rejects-italy-high-court-order.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by Italy's <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] which ordered Germany to pay 1 million euros (USD $1.3 million) in damages to relatives of civilians killed in the town of Civitella during the war, <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3899824,00.html">violated the principle of state immunity</a> [DW report]. The lawyers representing Germany argued before the court that <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/COGRA/APWorldNews/Article_2011-09-12-EU-World-Court-Germany-Italy/id-8fc7fda191d94ae4875de40fbab62c8d">international law would be "atomized" and "politicized"</a> [AP report] if the ICJ were to accept the Italian court's decision. Germany further argues that it has already compensated Italy for Nazi-related damages pursuant to a 1961 treaty. The ICJ is not expected to hand down its decision for several months.

<p>In October 2008 the Court of Cassation <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_ottobre_21/cassazione_stragi_germania_c8b20ca4-9f87-11dd-b0d4-00144f02aabc.shtml">awarded the damages</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report, in Italian] in a case against Max Josef Milde, a German sergeant present at the Civitella attack, who was sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life in prison. Under Italian law, crime victims may seek civil damages as part of a criminal proceeding. Germany had argued that the 1961 Bonn Treaty, where Germany agreed to pay 40 million marks to Italy for war crimes committed, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-rejects-italy-high-court-order.php">closed all further financial compensation claims</a> [JURIST report], but the Italian court held the treaty only applied to treatment of the Jews. International agreements that govern situations in which a nation may claim immunity include the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/074.htm">European Convention on State Immunity</a> [text], ratified by members of the Council of Europe in 1972, and the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/4_1_2004.pdf">UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property</a> [text, PDF], adopted in 2004.

In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/afghanistan0911webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] entitled "Just Don't Call It a Militia: Impunity, Militias, and the Afghan Local Police," HRW alleges that the national army and police have been committing serious human rights violations such as killings, rape, arbitrary detention, abductions, forcible land seizures and illegal raids. These abuses have taken place across the country but are on the rise in places that have been secure historically, like the northeastern Kunduz province. Creation of local militias has increased in recent years in an effort to combat insurgency and address the country's deteriorating security. These local militias, according to HRW, lack proper oversight and are often "hijacked" by local leaders who purport to use the militias for personal gain. Despite improvements and efforts to increase supervision of the army and police forces, HRW says the state-run institutions have proven ineffective. HRW recommended that the Afghan government "sever all ties with irregular armed groups and abusive commanders, and take immediate steps to create well-trained, properly vetted security forces that operate within the rule of law and are held accountable for their actions." HRW also called on the US and international community to assist the Afghan government in creating guidelines and establishing enforcement mechanisms to eliminate the abuses.

<p>Afghanistan has received much criticism for its human rights record. Corruption, abuse of power and a focus on short-term security goals in Afghanistan have <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensified the issue of poverty</a> [JURIST report], affecting more than two-thirds of the population, according to a March 2010 <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/SPdocs/Countries/AF/PovertyReport_30032010.doc">report</a> [text, DOC] from the UN's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website].

In February 2009, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] released its annual <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm">2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [DOS materials], <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">criticizing Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] for its continued use of child labor.

A spokesman for EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ashton/about/cv/index_en.htm">Foreign Affairs Chief Catherine Ashton</a> [official profile] confirmed that Ashton and US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE78B1VP20110912?pageNumber=3&virtualBrandChannel=0">wrote a letter to Yanukovych</a> [Reuters report] on Friday regarding the case, but declined to elaborate on the contents of the communication. The trial is set to resume on September 27. 

<p>Last month, former Ukrainian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4035789.stm">Viktor Yushchenko</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yushchenko">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-president-testifies-against-former-ally-tymoshenko.php">testified against</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko, his former prime minister. That same month, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in August, Kireyev <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukrain</a>e (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by Yanukovych. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During her address to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], Pillay said "that, according to reliable sources on the ground, the number of those killed since the onset of the unrest in mid-March 2011 in [Syria], has now reached at least 2,600." This figure represents a marked increase in the number of casualties as calculated by the UN. In August, Pillay told the HRC that the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Syriainturmoil.aspx">death toll stood at 2,200</a> [press release]. Bouthaina Shaaban, political and media adviser to Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=President+Bashar+al-Assad">news archive</a>], <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/12/us-syria-toll-idUSTRE78B1QU20110912">refuted the number</a> [Reuters report], saying a total of 1,400 had been killed since mid-March. Shaaban said the numbers were split evenly, with 700 opposition protesters and 700 government forces killed as a result of the unrest. She also stated that Syria could produce a list of the names of the victims. 

<p>Last month, Pillay called on the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> to refer Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">investigate the violent suppression of anti-government protests</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay's remarks came after the Fact-finding Mission in Syria published its 22-page report concluding that Syrian government forces cracking down on the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">Fact-finding Mission was established</a> [JURIST report] by the HRC in April but was not permitted to enter the country. Also last month, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that an unknown Western country is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/unknown-western-nation-funding-icc-investigation-of-syria:%20report.php">funding an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Syria's recent human rights abuses. In July, two UN rights officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-officials-warn-of-possible-syria-human-rights-abuses.php">expressed concern over reports of violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against the country's own people.</p>

<p>1:30 PM ET ~ The UNHRC has named a three-person panel of international experts to investigate allegations of human rights violations including possible crimes against humanity in Syria. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Boer is the Afrikaans word for farmer and broadly refers to whites in general and Afrikaners in particular. Malema argued earlier that the words were not to be taken literally and that the song was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/world/africa/13southafrica.html">celebration of fight against minority rule</a> [NYT report], <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Struggle-Song-Ruled-Hate-Speech-by-South-Africa-High-Court-129660448.html">not meant to incite hatred or violence</a> [VOA report]. Kallie Kriel, CEO of <a href="http://www.afriforum.co.za/english/">Afriforum</a> [advocacy website], which brought the civil hate speech suit, <a href="http://www.afriforum.co.za/english/2011-09-12-shoot-the-boer-constitutes-hate-speech/">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release] which stretches far beyond Malema, prohibiting all South Africans from singing the song. The ruling, which comes after months of live national television coverage, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hxZ36lFlMdb3CFke3VTvpNbhADVA?docId=8476bfc828ea4bc48e63802204e8fe76">opens the door for criminal prosecutions</a> [AP report] against anyone who defies the judge's order. Crowds outside the courtroom defiantly broke out singing the now-infamous song. Malema is also facing a separate ANC disciplinary hearing which, if found guilty, could result in his expulsion from the party altogether.

<p>The ruling is another test for legal boundary lines between prohibited hate speech and constitutionally guaranteed free speech in Africa's largest democracy. JURIST guest columnist Gregory Gordon recently <a href="/forum/2011/05/gregory-gordon-arap-sang.php">called for a more accurate understanding</a> [JURIST op-ed] of the nascent and rapidly evolving area of international speech crime law. In June, Dutch politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=geert+wilders">news archive</a>] was <a href="http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/detailpage.aspx?ljn=BQ9001&u_ljn=BQ9001">acquitted of all charges</a> [judgment text, in Dutch], the court finding his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/dutch-court-acquits-politician-in-hate-speech-case.php">anti-Islam statements were not hate speech or discriminatory</a> [JURIST report]. Wilders has made several "anti-Islam" comments as a political official, including: several comments similar to "I don't hate Muslims, I hate Islam"; comparing the Koran to <em>Mein Kampf</em> and calling for it to be banned; proposing a tax on wearing a hijab, or burqa; proposing a halt to Muslim immigration to the Netherlands. In December, the chief prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-accuses-6-kenyans-of-orchestrating-2007-post-election-violence.php">issued summonses</a> [JURIST report] for <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/BA2041D8-3F30-4531-8850-431B5B2F4416.htm">six Kenyan citizens</a> [press release] believed to be responsible for <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Kenya+2007+election">post-election violence in 2007</a> [JURIST news archive] that resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in that country.  Among those summoned was radio broadcaster <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12001281">Joshua Arap Sang</a> [BBC profile] who is accused of committing crimes against humanity (persecution on political grounds) in part through broadcasting messages urging violence against certain Kenyan ethnic groups following the controversial 2007 presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendment also prevents courts from "look[ing] to the legal precepts of other nations or cultures." The law condemns Muslims and their religious beliefs, <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/article/Denver-appellate-court-to-hear-Islamic-law-case-2166079.php">argued</a> [AP report] the attorney for <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/muneer-awad/">Muneer Awad</a> [WT backgrounder], executive director of the Oklahoma <a href="http://www.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy website]. Oklahoma Solicitor General Patrick Wyrick defended the law as necessary to prevent confusion in the courts, but one judge questioned why Sharia law was singled out.

The 7-0 vote rejects the 2009 <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2009/09/02/14/United_States_v._al_Bahlul_-_Brief_for_Appellant__1_September_2009_.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">appeal</a> [brief, PDF] of his <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-commission-jury-convicts.php">conviction</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-commission-sentences-yemeni.php">life sentence</a> [JURIST reports] for conspiring with al Qaeda, soliciting murder and providing material support for terrorism. His Pentagon-appointed defense lawyers argued that his constitutional rights were violated because a supposed al Qaeda recruitment film he released is protected speech under the First Amendment.

<p>Al Bahlul's appeal was required under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ366.109.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF], and it is <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2009/09/02/1214739/bin-laden-aides-guantanamo-conviction.html">unclear</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] whether he authorized the appeal. Al Bahlul previously boycotted much of his trial proceedings. Al Bahlul, a 39-year old Yemeni citizen, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/second-guantanamo-detainee-goes-on.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2008. He is alleged to have been Osama bin Laden's personal assistant and media secretary and was charged in February 2008 with conspiracy, solicitation to commit murder and attacks on civilians, and providing material support for terrorism. He is accused of researching the financial impact of the 9/11 attacks and also releasing the "martyr wills" of 9/11 hijackers Muhammed Atta and Ziad al Jarrah as propaganda videos. Al Bahlul was the second detainee to go on trial at Guantanamo since the prison there opened in 2002 and is the only convicted criminal currently held at the facility.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group filed the complaint on behalf of clergy sex abuse survivors from the <a href="http://www.snapnetwork.org/">Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests</a> (SNAP) [advocacy website], submitting more than <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/clergy-sex-victims-file-international-criminal-court-complaint-case-charges-vatican-officials-%E2%80%98crime">20,000 pages of materials</a> [press release] allegedly evidencing crimes against humanity. Though abuse has been reported around the globe, the suit claims that in the US alone nearly 6,000 priests have been accused of molestation, estimating more than 100,000 US victims. Though the claims may not reach the ICC's jurisdictional standard for investigating war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, plaintiffs are likely to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/world/europe/14vatican.html">receive the international attention and awareness they are seeking</a> [NYT report] just by filing the suit. The complaint states:<blockquote>As will be shown below, high-level Vatican officials, including Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, either knew and/or in some cases consciously disregarded information that showed subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes. ... They bear the greatest responsibility for the system that fosters and allow sexual violence. Time and again church officials have chosen the path of secrecy and protecting their ranks over the safety and physical and mental well-being of children and vulnerable adults, families of victims and their communities. ... [T]here are documented cases showing that church officials have gone so far as to obstruct justice and/or destroyed evidence in national legal systems and have consistently engaged in the practice of "priest shifting," i.e. transferring known offenders to other locations where they continued to have access to children or vulnerable adults and who officials knew continued to commit rape and other acts of sexual violence.</blockquote>
If jurisdiction is granted, this could be the first time the ICC investigates crimes committed by Catholic clergy members.  

<p>In February 2010, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/vatican-releases-church-response.php">Vatican released church procedures</a> [JURIST report] for handling alleged cases of sexual abuse by priests, instructing, "Civil law concerning reporting of crimes to the appropriate authorities should always be followed." The "Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations" summarizes the procedures governing investigations by the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_pro_14071997_en.html">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> (CDF) [official profile] into allegations of sex abuse by clergy members. The CDF guidelines provide for interim measures meant to ensure the safety of others during civil authorities' investigations or legal proceedings. The guidelines also outline a multi-tiered system of enforcement and appeals, including local bishops, the CDF, and the Pope himself. Since 2007, in the US alone, the Church has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=diocese+abuse">settled more than 500 cases</a> [JURIST news archive] of abuse for over $900 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Protests in Egypt have continued as many believe the interim government is not progressing toward change quickly enough.

He was then sentenced without a formal hearing and without his lawyers present. In March, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces unveiled an interim constitution that allows the council to retain control over the country until an elected government is installed. The document <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8953/Egypt/Politics-/Armed-Forces-announces-Egypts-interim-Constitution.aspx">vests the military council with presidential powers</a> [Al-Ahram report], including the abilities to introduce legislation, veto existing laws and act as Egypt's representative to the international community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN leader forwarded the report, compiled by a panel of experts appointed by the secretary-general, to the president of the HRC and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] asking them to evaluate the claims and determine a course of action which could include an international inquiry. The panel of experts found credible allegations of serious human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan government, including the killing of civilians through widespread shelling and the denial of humanitarian assistance. The government of Sri Lanka has opposed the findings of the panel. According to a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5506">statement released along with the report</a> [text], "the Secretary-General had given time to the Government of Sri Lanka to respond to the report, the Government has declined to do so, and instead has produced its own reports on the situation in the north of Sri Lanka, which are being forwarded along with the panel of experts report." The panel also recommended a review of the UN's actions regarding the implementation of its humanitarian and protection mandates during the war in Sri Lanka. The secretary-general has asked <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/public/about/ed/pid/4741">Thoraya Obaid</a> [profile], former executive director of the <a href="http://www.unfpa.org/public/home;jsessionid=D4C4788A523B2281A7182DAF2CD0C05D.jahia01">UN Population Fund</a> (UNFPA) [official website], to conduct the review.

<p>In April, a <a href="http://www.un.org/en/rights/srilanka.shtml">UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka</a> [backgrounder] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE. The special panel, appointed by the secretary-general, found that allegations of numerous war crimes and crimes against international humanitarian law asserted against both the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE warranted further investigation. In December, the Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.mea.gov.lk/">Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">UN panel would be allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to look into alleged war crimes. The decision signaled a reversal after months of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government, who described the UN panel as an infringement of Sri Lanka's sovereignty. <a href="http://president.gov.lk/index.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile] appointed his own Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to investigate the final years of the conflict from the ceasefire in 2002 to its conclusion in 2009. Despite having its credibility contested by several human rights organizations, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-war-crimes-commission-begins-public-hearings.php">LLRC began public hearings</a> [JURIST report] in August 2010 with an appearance by <a href="http://www.defence.lk/main_abt.asp?fname=SoD">Sri Lanka Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-defense-minister-defends-government-conduct-during-civil-war.php">defended the actions of the government</a> [JURIST report] during the conflict.

The report alleges the Gaddafi regime has:<blockquote>committed serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL), including war crimes, and gross human rights violations, which point to the commission of crimes against humanity . . . Members and supporters of the opposition, loosely structured under the leadership of the National Transitional Council (NTC), based throughout the conflict in Benghazi, have also committed human rights abuses, in some cases amounting to war crimes, albeit on a smaller scale.</blockquote>The organization warned that if the NTC fails to address these allegations, violations of international law could continue to occur. Foreign nationals, specifically those from sub-Saharan Africa who are being held in detainment camps, are at particular risk of suffering from abuse according to the report. AI called on the NTC to make the investigation of those suspected of perpetrating human rights abuses a top priority. The organization warned that without an investigation "justice would not be done and a vicious cycle of abuses and reprisals risks being perpetuated. ... Libyans have had to endure great suffering for decades. They deserve to participate in the building of a new Libya where these kinds of abuses are no longer repeated."

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread during the conflict in Libya. On Sunday, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] sent a <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/489/04/PDF/N1148904.pdf?OpenElement">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/index.html">UN Security Council</a> (UNSC) [official website] seeking the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-secretary-general-calls-for-creation-of-libya-mission.php">formation of a mission to provide assistance</a> [JURIST report] to the new post-conflict authorities in Libya. Last month, <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> (PHR) [advocacy website] <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/Libya-WitnesstoWarCrimes-Aug2011.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] Libyan troops <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-troops-using-children-as-human-shields-report.php">used children as human shields</a> [JURIST report] to deter attacks by the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website]. Also last month, Libyan Prime Minister Al Baghdad Ali Al-Mahmoudi requested that the UN create a "high-level commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">investigate alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by NATO. In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to extend a mandate to an investigative panel instructing it to continue its <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">investigation of human rights abuses</a> in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." The <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since February.<br />

The universities received permission from <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/corporate/index.html">Google</a> [corporate website] to scan approximately 7 million copyright-protected books and started a program allowing unlimited downloads for students and faculty of certain protected book deemed "orphans" by the university. The first group of 27 "orphan" books is scheduled to be released on October 13 to approximately 250,000 students. An additional 140 books will be released in November. The complaint alleged:<blockquote>The Universities have directly caused millions of works that are protected by copyright to be scanned, stored in digital format, repeatedly copied and made available online for various uses. These actions not only violate the exclusive rights of copyright holders to authorize the reproduction and distribution of their works but, by creating at least two databases connected to the Internet that store millions of digital copies of copyrighted books, the Universities risk the widespread, unauthorized and irreparable dissemination of those works.</blockquote>Plaintiffs seek an injunction to prevent defendants from systematically reproducing, distributing and/or displaying the plaintiffs' copyrighted books without permission.

<p>Google's library scanning project is the focus of another federal lawsuit in New York, with a hearing scheduled for September 15. In March, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-rejects-google-books-settlement.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the amended class action settlement agreement between Google and groups of authors and publishers who brought a <a href="http://dockets.justia.com/docket/new-york/nysdce/1:2005cv08136/273913/">copyright suit</a> [case materials] in 2005 against the Internet giant over its <a href="http://books.google.com/">book-scanning initiative</a> [Google Book Search website]. The settlement was reached after over two years of negotiations between Google and the Authors Guild, a group seeking to preserve copyright protection for authors, and other plaintiffs including the Association of American Publishers (AAP), McGraw-Hill, Penguin Group and Simon &#38; Schuster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Republican-controlled <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Senate/Senate.html">Senate</a> [official website] voted 30-16 to place the proposed amendment on the ballot. The Senate voted on the measure after the <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/House/House.html">House</a> [official website] on Monday voted 75-42 to approve the proposed amendment after over three hours of debate. Voters will decide in May whether the proposed amendment will be added to the state's constitution. Although North Carolina has a statutory definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, it is the only southern state that does not have a ban on same-sex marriage. The proposed amendment would add to the constitution:<blockquote>Marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State. This section does not prohibit a private party f om entering into contracts with another private party; nor does this section prohibit courts from adjudicating the rights of private parties pursuant to such contracts.</blockquote>There are <a href="http://www2.nbc17.com/news/wake-county/2011/sep/13/gay-marriage-ban-will-be-may-ballot-nc-ar-1386434/">30 states</a> [AP report] that currently have similar same-sex marriage bans as part of their state constitutions.

<p>Same-sex marriage remains a controversial issue throughout the US. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-arizona-same-sex-couples-insurance-benefits-temporarily.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Arizona House Bill 2013, a law rescinding health benefits for same-sex couples in the public sector, is in violation of the equal protection clause of the US Constitution. In May, the Minnesota Legislature <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnestoa-legislator-ballot-measure-banning-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] adding a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage to the November 2012 ballot. In April, the Indiana Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> an amendment to the state constitution that would ban same-sex marriage or any "substantially similar" status, and the Wyoming Senate in February approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">void in Wyoming any same-sex marriages and civil unions</a> [JURIST reports] performed in other jurisdictions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The delegation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-investigators-to-asses-yemen-human-rights-situation.php">sent to Yemen in late June</a> [JURIST report] to gather information about the country's human rights situation by meeting with officials, civilians, members of opposition groups, religious leaders and victims of rights violations. Preliminary findings were <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/ohchr-mission-calls-for-aid-to-prevent-yemen-humanitarian-crisis.php">released in July</a> [JURIST report]. The OHCHR verified that the Yemeni government is firing on peaceful protesters as well as warring against armed rebels, and that as a tactic of war, both sides are withholding water, fuel and electricity from civilians:<blockquote>The Mission notes the danger that the protests might become increasingly radicalized and more violent in response to the excessive use of lethal force by the government, and the growing involvement of, and intimidation by, armed elements within the demonstrations. In essence violence has led to more violence and it is a tribute to the street protesters that they have sought to maintain their peaceful character despite the heavy price in loss of life and in severe injuries that has been paid thus far. On the other hand, the Mission is alarmed by the deteriorating humanitarian situation, which is negatively affecting most Yemenis, but in particular the poorest and most vulnerable, such as children, IDPs and refugees. Isolated acts of sabotage cannot account for all the suffering witnessed by or reported to the Mission throughout the country and the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, water and other basic services should not be misused to punish the entire population. The Mission is of the view that calls for investigations and prosecutions will be undermined unless urgent measures are undertaken to ensure the independence and integrity of the judiciary and to provide them with sufficient resources. Additionally, given the lack of confidence by many Yemenis in the judiciary to conduct impartial investigations into human rights abuses there is a need for international, independent and impartial investigations to take place.</blockquote>The report also listed a number of human rights atrocities, including the government shooting at ambulances and preventing activists from receiving medical treatment, utilizing child soldiers and illegally detaining, torturing and killing an inestimable number of adults and children. The report ended with a plea to both the armed rebels and the government of Yemen to end the violence and called on the international community to condemn Yemen's action and provide humanitarian and financial relief to the nation.

<p>The delegation's report comes as many rights groups have criticized Yemen for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have persisted since February. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <A Href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] in April urging the international community to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate protestor deaths. Just days earlier, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-yemen-to-halt-use-of-force-against-protesters.php">urged the Yemeni government</a> [JURIST report] to stop using force against peaceful protesters. The Yemeni Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">enacted several emergency measures</a> [JURIST report] in March at the request of <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic] in an effort to end anti-government protests. Saleh, who <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down in April</a> [JURIST report], and his party, the General People's Congress (GPC), had caused mounting political tensions due to attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand their political power. In December, the parliament stoked outrage among opposition parties and independents when it <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipKDkB5w7UaeP0M9e8bZ1XdjZokQ?docId=CNG.9eab6633bebd069b5f0a3ec51e79b6e5.b51">amended the constitution</a> [AFP report] to eliminate provisions requiring that opposition parties be represented on the high election commission. The protests in Yemen have been analyzed in two recent JURIST op-eds: <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">Constitutional Enforcement in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt</a> by <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">L.

Although the two were already convicted and in jail for other charges, authorities moved them to pre-trial holding areas where indicted suspects await trial. Although Khodorkovsky's lawyer said the verdict was helpful, it will not have a significant affect on his clients' lives: "Unfortunately, no impact. They will say something like: 'Sorry, we were wrong. And the fact that you stayed in jail a few extra months&#8212;well, well, it happens. Maybe we'll even give you small compensation in this regard will issue. But everything else&#8212;has not been in our power.'" Khodorkovsky's legal team also announced that the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] will be <a href = "http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/european-court-rule-yukos-case">ruling on judgments against Khodorkovsky and Yukos Oil</a> [press release] on September 20.

<p>The Russian <a href="http://sledcom.ru/">Investigative Committee</a> [official website, in Russian] said in June that there was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/russia-panel-finds-no-proof-of-undue-pressure-on-khodorkovsky-judge.php">no evidence of undue pressure</a> [JURIST report] by superiors on the judge that sentenced Khodorkovsky. Also that month, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Khodorkovsky-reissues-parole-request-after-court-refused-it-for-insufficient-documentation.php">reissued his appeal for release on parole</a> [JURIST report] after the first attempt was returned due to insufficient documentation. Khodorkovsky has served half of a 13-year sentence, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/russia-appeals-court-upholds-khodorkovsky-conviction-reduces-sentence.php">reduced by a year</a> [JURIST report] last month, for fraud, theft and money laundering, which under Russian law makes him eligible for parole. In December, Judge Viktor Danilkin <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to six additional years in prison, extending their imprisonment to a total of 14 years. Their defense counsel staunchly criticized the ruling, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-denfense-team-statement-verdict">claiming</a> [press release] that the court blocked significant amounts of testimony and evidence submitted by the defense and systematically quashed objections to their omission. The verdict drew vehement <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge was brought by a self-employed couple that would be subject to the minimum coverage provision, arguing that Congress' Commerce Clause powers "do not comprehend the power to command individuals to engage in commerce in the first instance." The government contends that the "uniqueness" of the health care market and insurance, in that they entail payment for services before services are rendered, justifies the provision. In its analysis, the court, recognizing the split in authority that currently exists on the issue of mandated insurance coverage, looked to two recent decisions that endorsed different sides of argument and noted that both concur on the point that "the Health Care Act has no equivalent in Commerce Clause jurisprudence." This court also concluded that the provision had no equivalent and as a result, was unconstitutional. Judge Christopher Conner, writing for the court, addressed the novelty of the issue: <blockquote>Moreover, the court has been unable to find any precedent, and the parties have been unable to direct the court to any precedent, that permits the expansion of the Commerce Clause authority to regulate individuals prior to their engagement in commercial activity on the basis of the unique nature of the market being regulated. This court is bound by the principles of <em>stare decisis</em> and must reasonably interpret, not create, law. This court's interpretation of existing precedent, including <span class="casename">Lopez</span> and <span class="casename">Morrison</span>, leads the court to the conclusion that the Supreme Court would not construe the Commerce power to have such expansive reach. The extension of the Commerce Clause in the manner the government suggests is unsupported by precedent and therefore beyond the scope of this court's proper function to grant.</blockquote>The court also found the minimum coverage provision was closely tied to two other provisions of the PPACA&#8212;the guaranteed issue and preexisting condition health insurance reforms&#8212;which must then also be severed.

<p>Given the split in decisions being handed down, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] is expected to weigh in next year. Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">dismissed two lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the PPACA. In <span class="casename">Virginia v. Sebelius</span>, the court held that Virginia lacked standing to sue and vacated the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">judgment of the district court</a> [JURIST report], remanding the case with instructions to dismiss the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In <span class="casename">Liberty University v. Geithner</span>, the court ruled that the suit was filed prematurely, also vacating the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report], which had declared the act constitutional. Although the Fourth Circuit dismissed the cases without deciding the issue of constitutionality, other federal courts have not hesitated to address it. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">struck down the individual mandate</a> [JURIST report] as unconstitutional, creating a circuit split. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the law</a> in June, and that ruling was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?568366954">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The accusations against the two former French officials were made by a lawyer who worked as an aide to Chirac and claims to have participated in the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE78C0IE20110913?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">passage of over $20 million in cash</a> [Reuters report] from African leaders to be used as political donations. All of the alleged donations came from leaders of former French colonies. An investigation will also be launched by the Paris Bar into the actions taken by the accuser as his involvement with the passage of these funds is unethical within the legal profession. Chirac is also currently the subject of a corruption trial which the French <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French] ruled in May can continue, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/france-court-orders-chirac-corruption-trial-to-resume.php">rejecting a constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST report] brought by one of his co-defendants. Chirac is being tried for allegedly misusing funds during his time as Paris mayor in 1990. Meanwhile, Villepin, who was accused of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/paris-appeals-court-acquits-ex-pm-villepin-in-slander-case/2011/09/14/gIQAs2LMRK_story.html">participating in a smear campaign</a> [AP report]  against current <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/accueil.1.html">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French], was recently acquitted.

<p>Other former French officials have also been accused of scandals and subjected to investigations as a result. Last month, a commission of the Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/france-court-orders-probe-of-new-imf-chief.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the newly appointed Managing Director of the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website], Christine Lagarde, for her involvement in a $400 million arbitration agreement with French businessman Bernard Tapie. Tapie won a settlement with state-owned bank <a href="http://www.lcl.com/fr/">Credit Lyonnais</a> [official website, in French] in 2008 when Lagarde was acting as France's Finance Minister. A senior prosecutor contends that Lagarde "overstepped her authority" in allowing the arbitration to proceed because the controversy involved a state-owned institution. Furthermore, an investigation would be needed to determine whether Lagarde sufficiently probed the neutrality of one of the arbitration judges. The investigation will be ongoing for several months, after which a decision will be made about whether to send the case to trial. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/new-libya-regime-to-investigate-war-crimes-20110914-1k9n9.html">NTC was responding</a> [AFP report] to an <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">report published Tuesday</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate these allegations. On Tuesday the World Bank said it would <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22998913~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html">engage the NTC as the official Libya government</a> [press release] and is helping to rebuild the economy and infrastructure of the nation: <blockquote>As Libya begins its recovery from conflict, the World Bank has been asked to lead the effort in the areas of public expenditure and financial management, infrastructure repair, job creation for young people and service delivery. The World Bank joins the United Nations and the European Union as one of the three institutions invited by Libya's [NTC] to coordinate assistance for the north African nation as it forges a path forward after months of violent conflict.</blockquote>The World Bank has been asked to help restore water, energy and transportation services and, in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> [official website], help repair the national budget and the banking sector. 

<p>The NTC assured world leaders last week that Libya will be a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-interim-leaders-pledge-adherence-to-rule-of-law.php">society of tolerance and respect</a> [JURIST report] for the rule of law. During a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14758905">meeting</a> [BBC report] in Paris chaired by French <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11576712">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, NTC leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14613679">Mustafa Abdel Jalil</a> [BBC profiles] vowed to administer elections and draft a new constitution for Libya within 18 months. However, allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread during the Libya conflict. On Sunday, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] sent a <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/489/04/PDF/N1148904.pdf?OpenElement">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/index.html">UN Security Council</a> (UNSC) [official website] seeking the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-secretary-general-calls-for-creation-of-libya-mission.php">formation of a mission to provide assistance</a> [JURIST report] to the new post-conflict authorities in Libya.

The court ruled that the Dutch government is responsible for killings committed in the village of Rawagedeh, now called Balongsari, during the 1945-49 <a href="http://www.gimonca.com/sejarah/sejarah08.shtml">Indonesian War for Independence</a> [timeline], where Dutch troops allegedly executed more than 400 villagers. The Dutch government claimed that the statute of limitations barred the claims, but the court ruled the widows and survivor were able to bring their claims and receive compensation because they were direct victims of war crimes. However, the limitation period barred the claim of a daughter of one of the men killed. The court did not set the amount of compensation, and it is unclear whether the Dutch government will appeal the decision. 

<p>A Dutch court ruled in 2008 in favor of the government, finding that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/netherlands-says-statute-of-limitations.php">statute of limitations barred</a> [JURIST report] the plaintiffs' claims. Indonesian officials say that Dutch soldiers shot 431 people as they tried to escape the massacre, while a 1969 Dutch investigation reported that 150 people were killed. In 2009, the Dutch government, which has never apologized for the massacre, allegedly donated 850,000 euros to Balongsari, although the village claims that <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/rawagede-still-waiting-dutch-aid-money">it has not received the money</a> [RNW report]. The Netherlands colonized Indonesia, then called the Dutch East Indies, from the late sixteenth century until 1949. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Villepin was charged with "complicity in false accusation" for his alleged role in a plot to defame several French public figures, including current <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/lepresident/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official profile, in French; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sarkozy">news archive</a>]. Prosecutors claimed Villepin came into the possession of a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/paris-appeals-court-acquits-ex-pm-villepin-in-slander-case/2011/09/14/gIQAs2LMRK_story.html">list of secret bank accounts</a> [AP report] that held bribe money relating to illegal arms sales and named Sarkozy and several others as the owners of the accounts. The list was later determined to be fake and prosecutors argued that Villepin should have brought the list to the attention of judicial authorities earlier than he did. Villepin applauded the judiciary for remaining independent and "resist[ing] political pressure" in affirming the decision. He also relayed his hope that the decision would help make France "less vulnerable to rumors and slander" and reiterated his intention to run in the upcoming 2012 presidential election.

<p>A French court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/france-court-acquits-ex-pm-of-sarkozy.php">acquitted Villepin of all charges</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010.

Villepin was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/france-ex-pm-indicted-in-defamation.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] in November 2008, and his trial began in September 2009. Before his acquittal, de Villepin had faced the possibility of an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a &#8364;45,000 fine. Villepin's political image was tainted by the allegations as well as by his advance of an unpopular <a href="/currentawareness/cpe.php">youth labor law</a> [JURIST news archive] during his time as prime minister.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In unanimously adopting resolutions <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10382.doc.htm">2006</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10383.doc.htm">2007</a> [press releases], the Security Council extended the terms of prosecutors <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] and <a href="http://ictr-archive09.library.cornell.edu/ENGLISH/factsheets/Jallow.html">Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a> [Cornell profile]. Brammertz has served as Prosecutor of the ICTY since 2008, and Jallow has served as Prosecutor of the ICTR since 2003. The Security Counsel emphasized that both terms <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39547&Cr=criminal+tribunal&Cr1=">will expire when the tribunals complete their work</a> [UN News Centre] and urged both tribunals to complete their cases by December 2014. 

<p>The tribunals, created by the UN in 1993 and 1994, have been working to complete their caseloads. Last week, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/icty-sentences-former-yugoslav-army-chief-to-27-years.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] ex-Yugoslav army chief <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=perisic">Momcilo Perisic</a> [JURIST news archive] for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the wars in Bosnia and Croatia, including his participation in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive]. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mladic">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive], with whom Perisic allegedly collaborated, is still awaiting trial for genocide at The Hague.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronttunisia.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" vspace="4" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" border="0" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Tunisia announced its intention Wednesday to plead for the return of its remaining citizens being held at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detention facility. A Justice Ministry representative, speaking at an awareness conference in Tunis, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/14/ap/middleeast/main20106355.shtml">called for the repatriation</a> [AP report] of the five Tunisian detainees still being held at the prison and indicated the nation's intention to send a mission to the US to achieve their release. The conference was organized by <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/2011_09_13_tunisia/">press release</a>], a British humanitarian group and legal action charity that seeks to enforce human rights and due process for prisoners worldwide. In the past, such groups had been against repatriation due to <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/federal-judge-blocks-transfer-of.php">reports of torture</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/tunisia-abusing-ex-guantanamo-detainees.php">abusive interrogation</a> [JURIST reports] upon prisoners' return to Tunisia under the regime of ousted dictator <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>]. However, with the fall of the former regime and its reputation of human rights abuses, Reprieve claims there is no longer a reason to hold the remaining prisoners:<blockquote>On the night the Tunisian people successfully overthrew Ben Ali's dictatorship, five Tunisian men had just spent their ninth anniversary of imprisonment in the notorious US naval base. To date, they have had neither charge nor trial. Members of the interim government, international and national human rights activists, lawyers, ex-detainees and family members have all pledged their support for this cause. Today's conference will examine how this support can be turned into action.</blockquote>There have been <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/country/Tunisia">12 Tunisians imprisoned at the Guantanamo facility</a> [NYT backgrounder] since it opened in 2002, two of whom were <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/six-detainees-transferred-from.php">returned to Tunisia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/tunisia-appeals-court-affirms-terror.php">imprisoned</a> [JURIST reports] in 2007. The other five released detainees have been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">extradited</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/italy-deports-former-guantanamo-detainee-to-home-country-of-tunisia.php">third countries</a> [JURIST reports] for various reasons.

<p>The continued operation of Guantanamo Bay remains controversial. In February, JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute/about/who/shah">Naureen Shah</a> [university profile] from the Human Rights Institute at Columbia Law School <a href="/forum/2011/02/they-cant-go-home-again.php">wrote that some Guantanamo detainees cannot go home</a> [JURIST op-ed], and the US should design smarter monitoring protocols, let courts and the public test decide whether diplomatic assurances can prevent abuse, and resettle detainees who face too great a risk of torture. In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized US President Barack Obama</a> for failing to shut down the facility altogether, as Obama's <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">stated desire to close the Guantanamo prison</a> [JURIST reports] has faced heavy opposition in Congress. Earlier in January, Obama signed a bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] to the US for trial. The legislation authorized funding for defense interests abroad, military construction and national security-related energy programs and barred the use of funds to transfer detainees into the US and limited funds available for transfers to foreign countries. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government will abolish the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2082.pdf">Internal Security Act (ISA) of 1960</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2079.pdf">Banishment Act of 1959</a> [text, PDF]. The ISA allowed the prime minister to order the imprisonment of individuals deemed to be a threat to national security for a period of up to two years without a trial. The Banishment Act granted the prime minister the right to expel any non-citizen from the country. Razak also announced that the government will carefully review the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%208/Act%20377.pdf">Restricted Residence Act of 1933</a>, <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%207/Act%20301.pdf">Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984</a> and Section 27 of the <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%207/Act%20344.pdf">Police Act of 1967</a> [texts, PDFs], which allowed police supervision of suspects and regulated newspapers and the right of citizens to assemble peacefully. Some see the actions as <a href="http://www.thesundaily.my/news/145363">movement toward a more democratic government</a> [<em>The Sun Daily</em> report], while others warn that the announcement was politically motivated and not a strong sign of reform.

<p>Malaysia has been criticized for alleged rights violations. For example, last week, the three-judge Malaysian <a href="http://202.75.7.131/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=66&Itemid=33&lang=en">Federal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-court-rules-against-indigenous-people-in-land-rights-suit.php">ruled unanimously against indigenous people</a> [JURIST report] fighting against the Sarawak government's seizure of land to build a dam. The court had <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/malaysia-court-agrees-to-hear-indigenous-land-rights-suit.php">agreed to hear the suit</a> [JURIST report] in March. Two of the judges refused to rule on the constitutionality of the land takings, saying that the case should have gone to arbitration, and the third judge ruled that the takings were constitutional. The <a href="http://www.coac.org.my/codenavia/portals/coacv2/code/main/main.php?parentID=0">Center for Orang Asli Concerns</a> [advocacy website] expressed disappointment in the ruling, which it said failed to uphold citizens' rights. There are currently more than 100 unresolved land rights suits filed by indigenous people in Malaysia's lower courts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdulmutallab argued that the conduct of the FBI agents was coercive because they <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/hpc/docs/06.Motion_to_Suppress_Statements_Made_at_U_of_M_Hospital.pdf">interviewed him while under the effects of painkillers</a> [text, PDF] and did not give him <span class="casename">Miranda</span> warnings. The government responded that Abdulmutallab's <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/hpc/docs/12.Government_Opposition_to_Motion_to_Suppress_Statements_Made_To_Government_Agents_at_Milan_and_UofM_Hospital.pdf">statements were voluntary</a> [text, PDF] because the fact that an individual was on painkillers alone does not necessitate a finding of involuntariness and there was no evidence of any type of coercive conduct by the FBI agents. The government further argued that the lack of <span class="casename">Miranda</span> warnings was justified by the fact that Abdulmutallab claimed that he was trained by al Qaeda and the agents feared that an immediate interview was necessary to ascertain whether there were other imminent attacks planned. Judge Nancy Edmunds <a href="http://www.detnews.com/article/20110915/METRO/109150436/Judge-rules-Abdulmutallab%E2%80%99s-hospital-statements-admissible">agreed with the government</a> [<em>Detroit News</em> report] that national security concerns outweighed the need to give Abdulmutallab his <span class="casename">Miranda</span> warnings and testimony from hospital staff established that he was lucid and not confused, despite being administered a painkiller. The trial is set to begin October 11.

<p>The use of <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/ait/index.shtm">full body scanners</a> [TSA backgrounder] at airports is largely a response to Abdulmutallab's failed bombing attempt. In July the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-rejects-challenge-to-tsa-body-scans.php">rejected a constitutional challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the use of the controversial full body scanners by holding that the use of the scanners does not constitute an unreasonable search. In December a federal grand jury charged Abdulmutallab with <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/accused-plane-bomber-facing-additional-federal-charges.php">two new counts of conspiracy and firearm possession</a>, in addition to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/doj-announces-indictment-in-attempted.php">six previous charges</a> [JURIST reports] of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the US, willful attempt to destroy or wreck an aircraft, willfully placing a destructive device on an aircraft, use of a firearm/destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence, and possession of a firearm/destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence. In September 2010 Abdulmutallab <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/accused-plane-bomber-fires-lawyers-inquires-about-possible-guilty-plea.php">fired his lawyers and chose to represent himself</a> [JURIST report]. Abdulmutallab <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/not-guilty-plea-entered-in-attempted.php">plead not guilty to all charges</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthrw.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Thursday called on the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to correct an imbalance in its investigations and prosecutions of war crimes and human rights violations. In a 50-page publication titled <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2011/09/15/unfinished-business">"Unfinished Business"</a> [report, text; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/09/15/icc-case-selection-leaves-unfinished-business">press release</a>], HRW assessed the choice of cases made by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/">Office of the Prosecutor</a> (OTP) [official website] in its first five investigations, claiming that the resulting prosecutions do not go "far enough to ensure that justice delivered by the ICC will resonate with concerns of victims and affected communities." The court's jurisdiction may be triggered in one of three ways&#8212;state parties or the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] can refer a specific set of events termed a "situation" to the ICC prosecutor, or the OTP can seek on his own motion authorization by a pre-trial chamber of ICC judges to open an investigation. Based on HRW country expertise and close monitoring of the ICC over the past eight years, the report concludes that to safeguard the ICC's independence and impartiality, the OTP needs to investigate and bring to trial individuals responsible for some of the world's gravest crimes, especially government officials. For example, in Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), ICC investigations have targeted rebel groups but have not yielded charges against government officials and armed forces widely alleged to have committed serious human rights abuses. Without such prosecutions, or clear and public explanations as to why they are not being pursued, the ICC's perceived independence and impartiality is undermined worldwide. The report goes on to state that this is a critical time to correct such perceptions through new investigations, as ICC member states will elect a new prosecutor in December. The current ICC prosecutor, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile], was elected to a nine-year term in 2003. The HRW report was prepared by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/elizabeth-evenson">Elizabeth Evenson</a> [official profile], senior counsel in the humanitarian group's International Justice Program.

<p>The ICC is the world's first permanent court mandated to bring to justice perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so. The ICC treaty, known as the Rome Statute, entered into force in 2002, four years after 120 states adopted it during the Rome Conference. This month Ocampo announced that he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/icc-requests-help-from-interpol-to-locate-gaddafi.php">seeking assistance</a> [JURIST report] from <a href="http://www.interpol.int/default.asp">INTERPOL</a> [official website] to locate and arrest former Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], as the ICC has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi, his son and his brother-in-law for alleged crimes against humanity. Also this month the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/icc-begins-hearings-in-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">began hearings</a> in Kenya's post-election violence cases against the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-deny-charges-of-ethnic-killings.php">"Ocampo Six"</a> [JURIST reports] for incitement of violence during and after the 2007 Kenyan elections. The HRW report called these investigations into Kenyan government officials a "welcomed shift from past practice" and a "marked contrast to Congo" where prosecution delays inadvertently may have actually worsened ethnic tensions. However, it is notable that last month the ICC did <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-ends-first-war-crimes-trial.php">conclude its first war crimes trial</a> [JURIST report] with the prosecution of a Congo militia leader charged with enlisting child soldiers into his militia, one which is believed to have committed large-scale human rights abuses in DRC's violent Ituri district. A verdict in the case is expected in early 2012. In addition to the African investigations in Congo, northern Uganda, Libya and Kenya, along with others in the Central African Republic and the Darfur region of Sudan, the OTP is looking at situations in Afghanistan, Colombia, Georgia, Guinea, Honduras, Nigeria and South Korea. The Palestinian National Authority also has petitioned the ICC prosecutor to accept jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Gaza.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontgun.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/pi_decision.pdf">temporarily enjoined</a> [ruling, PDF] a Florida law restricting what physicians can ask or say about firearms to their patients as violative of the doctors' First Amendment rights. Under the <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/0432/BillText/c2/HTML">Firearm Owners' Privacy Act</a> (FOPA) [text], violating doctors risk losing their medical license and up to a $10,000 fine for "asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm" or "unnecessarily harassing a patient about firearm ownership." Judge Marcia Cooke rejected Florida's argument that the law was about protecting <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentii">Second Amendment</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/guncontrol.php">news archive</a>] rights:<blockquote>This case concerns one of our Constitution's most precious rights&#8212;the freedom of speech. "Open speech by a private citizen on a matter of public importance lies at the heart of expression subject to protection by the First Amendment." Courts have also emphasized the importance of the free flow of truthful, non-misleading information within the doctor-patient relationship. The State has attempted to inveigle this Court to cast this matter as a Second Amendment case. Despite the State's insistence that the right to "keep arms" is the primary constitutional right at issue in this litigation, a plain reading of the statute reveals that this law in no way affects such rights. The right to keep arms refers to the right to "retain," "to have in custody," and "to hold" weapons, including firearms. A practitioner who counsels a patient on firearm safety, even when entirely irrelevant to medical care or safety, does not affect nor interfere with the patient's right to continue to own, possess, or use firearms. The Act&#8212;directed at ensuring patients' privacy rights concerning firearm ownership&#8212;does not implicate rights that the Second Amendment protects.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.aap.org">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> (AAP) [advocacy website], also a party to the lawsuit to block the law, <a href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/releases/Flabill91411final.pdf">welcomed</a> [press release, PDF] the ruling. FOPA took effect in June and is the <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/judge-blocks-fla-law-1181171.html">first law of its kind in the US</a> [AP report]. The temporary <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/15/us-guns-doctors-odds-idUSTRE78E4B520110915">injunction seems likely to become permanent</a> [Reuters report].

<p>Gun control laws remain a contentious issue across the US. Previously, states took more or less restrictive approaches to gun control based on local state legislation. In June 2008, however, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/07-290P.ZO">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun for the purpose of self-defense, overturning the District of Columbia's restrictive firearms law. Two years later, in June 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1521.ZO.html">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government, thereby overturning Chicago's ban on handguns and raising considerable uncertainty about what amount of regulations of firearms was permissible. In July 2010, just four days after the Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="casename">McDonald</span>, the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html">Chicago City Council</a> [official website] unanimously approved a new gun control ordinance that bans gun shops in Chicago and prohibits gun owners from stepping outside their homes, including porches and garages, with a handgun. Shortly thereafter, a group of Chicago citizens, supported by both the <a href="http://home.nra.org/#/home">National Rifle Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.nafr.org/About.cfm">National Association of Firearm Retailers</a> [advocacy websites], <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/citizens-file-suit-against-chicago-gun-control-ordinance.php">filed suit against the city</a> [JURIST report] claiming the new gun control ordinance infringes on their constitutional rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ahmed Ezz, a steel tycoon and former ranking member of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-court-dissolves-mubaraks-national-democratic-party.php">now-dissolved National Democratic Party</a> [JURIST report], was accused of obtaining low cost materials necessary to the steel industry by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-egypt-crony-20110916,0,873938.story">illegally manipulating</a> [LAT report] state-owned businesses. The former head of Egyptian industrial development, Amr Assal, was accused of collaborating with Ezz and <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/21332/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-steel-tycoon-Ezz-sentenced-to--years-and-.aspx">granting licenses</a> [<em>Ahram online</em> report] to steel companies that were without merit. Former trade minister Rachid Mohamed Rachid, was also sentenced for collaborating with Ezz by granting licenses without receiving payment and for <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptMarketNews/idAFL5E7KF1VU20110915?sp=true">misusing public funds</a> [Reuters report]. Rachid was also sentenced to prison in June for <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/egypt-ministers-acquitted-on-charges-of-misappropriating-state-funds.php">squandering public funds and profiteering</a> [JURIST report]. Ezz and Assal were both ordered to serve 10 years in prison and were ordered to pay fines totaling USD $111 million. The sentencing judge indicated that Ezz and Assal's fine represented the public funds they had wasted. Rachid was sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to a 15-year prison term and was ordered to pay a USD $237 million fine. The men do have the option of appealing their sentences to the Court of Cassation. 

<p>The men's sentences were handed down as Egyptians await the outcome of the trial against Mubarak. Mubarak's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">began on August 3</a> [JURIST report] with Mubarak and his sons pleading not guilty to all charges of corruption and murder. Presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-resumes-live-tv-broadcasts-to-end.php">decided to end live TV broadcasts</a> [JURIST report] of subsequent proceedings amid protests from the families of victims and praise from several courtroom lawyers who opposed the broadcasts. Officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place at a convention center in downtown Cairo. In July, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, so it would coincide with Mubarak's trial. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters. <a href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report] and more than 6,000 injured during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

They state that the failure to meet the committee's request leads them to believe that the policies and regulations to implement repeal are either incomplete or inaccurate. McKeon and Wilson also noted that they find it "unconscionable" that the policies and regulations surrounding repeal of DADT remain unpublished. According to the letter, some of the regulations necessary for repeal must go through a notice and comment period which is not scheduled to begin until September 20. McKeon and Wilson indicate that allowing repeal to go forward before the notice and comment period has been completed would contravene the July <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-certifies-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">certification of the repeal</a> [JURIST report]. The letter asks Panetta to delay the effective date of the DADT repeal until "[Department of Defense] managers have fully resolved all the questions emerging from the review and comment process." 

<p>Earlier this month, lawyers for the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official websites] to overturn a ruling that the DADT policy is a violation of service members' constitutional rights, arguing that the impendency of repeal renders the original court decision moot. In July, the Ninth Circuit ruled that DADT would <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-again-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">remain partially in effect</a> [JURIST report] during the 60 days prior to its newly-scheduled repeal. The court effectively reiterated its order <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] the previous week, in which it reinstated DADT but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy. Hours earlier, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], Panetta and the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified DADT's repeal, scheduling the policy to end September 20. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/=/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed the bill to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report] in December. The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a>  [HR 2965 materials] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved in the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2011/09/16/uk_alters_law_targeting_war_crimes_suspects/">controversial act</a> [AP report] removes the exclusive power of granting arrest warrants from local magistrates, requiring that all such warrants receive approval from the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/about/dpp.html">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> (DPP) [official profile]. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke of the UK Ministry of Justice <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/press-releases/moj/pressrelease150911a.htm">said</a> [press release] about the bill, "[w]e are clear about our international obligations and these new changes to existing law will ensure the balance is struck between ensuring those who are accused of such heinous crimes do not escape justice and that universal jurisdiction cases are only proceeded with on the basis of solid evidence that is likely to lead to a successful prosecution." The amendment is seen as a move by the UK government to improve relations with foreign countries such as China and Israel, after several government officials were forced to cancel trips to the UK out of fears of being arrested. The bill states:<blockquote>Where a person who is not a public prosecutor lays an information before a justice of the peace in respect of an offense to which this subsection applies, no warrant shall be issued under this section without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. ... Subsection (4A) applies to (a) a qualifying offense which is alleged to have been committed outside the United Kingdom, or (b) an ancillary offense relating to a qualifying offense where it is alleged that the qualifying offense was, or would have been, committed outside the United Kingdom.</blockquote>The <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/uk-proposes-law-limiting-arrests-under-universal-jurisdiction.php">bill was proposed</a> [JURIST report] last December.  

<p>UK officials had promised Israel that a change in the law was coming for some time. Former UK attorney general Patricia Janet Scotland gave a speech early this year at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, stating that UK officials were working to <a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/cgi-bin/dovrut/dovrut_search_eng.pl?mesge126268782732688760">resolve the issue</a> [press release] and protect senior officials traveling to the UK. In December 2009, former Israeli foreign minister <a href="http://tzipilivni.co.il/">Tzipi Livni</a> [official website, in Hebrew] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uk-court-issues-then-revokes-arrest.php">canceled a UK trip</a> [JURIST report] after a British magistrate court issued, and later revoked, an arrest warrant for her on war crimes charges relating to Israel's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">Gaza offensive</a> [JURIST news archive]. In October 2009, Vice Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/israel-cabinet-minister-cancels-uk-trip.php">called off</a> [JURIST report] a scheduled trip to the UK after legal advisers from the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA">Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] said that he may be arrested over his involvement in a 2002 airstrike that killed a Hamas leader and 14 civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Spanish government continues to actively pursue charges against ETA.

In January, Spanish Judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-finds-eta-attempted-to-kill.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that ETA had tried three times to assassinate former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001 but had failed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontobamasigning.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] signed the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/data/us/bills.text/112/h/h1249enr.pdf">America Invents Act</a> [text, PDF; HR 1249 <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1249">materials</a>] into law on Friday. The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/senate-approves-legislation-reforming-us-patent-system.php">approved the bill earlier this month</a> [JURIST report], and the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-house-approves-patent-reform-bill.php">approved the bill in June</a> [JURIST report]. The act represents the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/09/16/obama.patent.reform/">first change to the American patent system since 1952</a> [CNN report]. Major differences include changing the patent system from first-to-invent to first-to-file, allowing the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent &#38; Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) [official website] to keep all of the fees generated from patent filing rather than having them diverted by Congress, allowing third parties to introduce relevant material to patent examiners during the patent application review process and removing the "best mode" requirement from patents. The changes are intended to give the USPTO greater autonomy, increase funding so the USPTO can address the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/dashboards/patents/main.dashxml">substantial patent application backlog</a> [USPTO materials] and decrease the amount of patent litigation. The <a href="http://www.patentfairness.org/">Coalition for Patent Fairness</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.patentfairness.org/media/press/#2011-09-16-1">stated</a> [press release] that the America Invents Act "is an important step forward for the nation's patent system" and that it will "harmonize America's patent system and allow us to continue to compete in the international marketplace."

<p>Patent holding firms, dubbed <a href="http://www.filament.com.au/ip-intelligence/patent-troll.aspx">"patent trolls"</a> [Filament backgrounder], have been a <a href="http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2011/09/guest-post-patent-troll-myths.html">controversial</a> [Patently-O report] subject for the US patent system to address. Noted patent holding companies include <a href="http://www.intellectualventures.com/Home.aspx">Intellectual Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.asuresoftware.com/">Asure Software</a> [corporate websites]. Many patent holding companies generate their revenue solely by suing other companies for patent infringement and do not produce anything of their own. The America Invents Act attempts to address the "patent troll" problem by decreasing the number of "junk" patents that are issued via increasing funding to the USPTO and allowing third parties to submit relevant materials during the patent review process. Patent litigation by and against patent holding firms has been especially rampant in the mobile phone business. Last month <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/corporate/index.html">Google</a> purchased 1,023 patents from <a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/en/">IBM</a> [corporate websites] in order to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-14/google-purchases-1-023-patents-from-ibm-to-bolster-portfolio.html">defend itself against smartphone patent-infringement lawsuits</a> [Bloomberg report]. Earlier that month Google also purchased <a href="http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/Landing/US-EN/About/dlp_us_en_about.html">Motorola</a> [corporate website] for USD $12.5 billion, <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2011/googles-125-billion-motorola-deal-shakes-mobile-world">primarily for Motorola's patent library</a> [GeekWire report]. Other recent patent reform includes separate rulings by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in June that patents will only be invalidated if the challenging party meets the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules-against-microsoft-in-patent-infringement-case.php">"clear and convincing evidence" standard</a> [JURIST report] and that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/usc_sup_01_35_10_II_20_18.html">Bayh-Doyle Act</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 200-212], which vests patent rights to universities for inventions from federally funded research, did not give <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> [academic website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-supreme-court-rules-in-case-over-stanfords-rights-to-hiv-testing-invention.php">superior rights to the invention of its employee</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mbarushimana, former leader of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/fdlr.htm">Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda</a> (FDLR) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], is charged with 13 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1076399.stm">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) [BBC backgrounder] in 2009. In September 2010, the ICC issued a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc954979.pdf">warrant</a> [text, PDF] for Mbarushimana's arrest on charges including attacks against civilian population, murder, torture, rape, inhumane acts, inhumane treatment and persecution. On Thursday, ICC Judge Sanji Mmasenono Monageng <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1233303.pdf">decided</a> [decision, PDF] that the prosecution could not disclose to the defense the name of the villages referenced by two witnesses or refer to this information at the confirming hearings. During the public confirming hearing, the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber decides which, if any, charges will brought against Mbarushimana by the prosecution. 

<p>In August, Judges for the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-postpones-hearing-for-drc-war-crimes-suspect.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] the opening of Mbarushimana's confirmation of charges hearing, originally set for August 17, until September 16. In postponing the hearing, the judges wrote, "that disclosure related issues raised just prior to the confirmation have rendered it impossible to fairly conduct the confirmation hearing on the scheduled date." No further reasons were given. Mbarushimana's lawyer, Nick Kaufman, expressed disappointment with the decision. Mbarushimana <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/drc-war-crimes-suspect-denies-allegations-at-initial-icc-appearance.php">made his initial appearance</a> [JURIST report] before the ICC in January and denied the charges against him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A French Muslim couple <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-muslim-couple-to-challenge-burqa-ban-in-echr-spain-court-uupholds-city-ban.php">filed a challenge to the burqa ban</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] in June.

The initial <a href="http://www.nyfrf.org/albanyupdate/Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF], filed by <a href="http://www.nycf.info/home">New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms</a> (NYCF) [advocacy website] and other groups in the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/7jd/Livingston/index.shtml">Seventh Judicial District of the New York State Supreme Court</a> [official website], alleged that the law is invalid because state officials failed to follow proper procedure. The groups argued that state officials violated New York's <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/coog/openmeetlaw.html">Open Meetings Law</a> [text] and failed to adhere to the <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/info/pdfs/Constitution.pdf">New York State Constitution</a> [text, PDF] mandatory three-day waiting period prior to a legislative vote on the matter. In his motion, Schneiderman <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/09/16/ag-schneiderman-asks-court-to-toss-new-york-anti-gay-marriage-suit/">argued</a> [CBSNewYork/AP report] that the groups did not have standing to sue because they were not harmed by the law and that separation of powers prevents the state judiciary from becoming involved in legislative matters. Schneiderman requested that a hearing take place on the matter on October 17.

<p>In July, Schneiderman <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/new-york-ag-files-brief-challenging-federal-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">filed an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], which bars recognition of same-sex marriages.  Schneiderman filed the brief in the case of <span class="casename">Windsor v. United States</span>, arguing that DOMA violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] by precluding same-sex couples from the same rights and privileges of opposite-sex couples, and that it intrudes on what had previously been the exclusive right of the states to define marriage. President Barack Obama has <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-supports-doma-repeal.php">expressed support</a> [JURIST report] for the repeal of DOMA and also support for the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced by Congressional Democrats</a> [JURIST report] in February to repeal DOMA. In March, House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] announced that he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">launching a legal advisory group</a> [JURIST report] to defend DOMA. Democrats introduced the Respect for Marriage Act following February's announcement by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA, which restricts the federal definition of marriage to heterosexual couples, in court cases challenging the provision. The announcement came just one month after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontpolarbears.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.courts.state.va.us/">Virginia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1100764.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Friday that the effects of  <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22global+warming%22">global warming</a> [JURIST news archive] are not covered by a standard liability insurance policy. The <a href = "http://www.aes.com/aes/index?page=home">AES Corporation</a> [corporate website], a power company, is facing a suit, <span class = "casename">Kivalina v. Exxon Mobil Corp.</span>, for its contributions to global warming. AES expected that its insurance company, Steadfast, would defend this suit as part of their liability coverage. The Virginia Supreme court ruled that they are under no duty to do so, due to no single "accident" or "occurrence" forcing the suit, but intentional actions.<blockquote>We have held that an "accident" is commonly understood to mean "an event which creates an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means employed and is not intended, designed, or reasonably anticipated." Kivalina alleges that AES intentionally released tons of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as part of its electricity-generating operations. We have held that "[a]n intentional act is neither an 'occurrence' nor an 'accident' and therefore is not covered by the standard policy." ... If a result is the natural and probable consequence of an insured's intentional act, it is not an accident. However, even though the insured's action starting the chain of events was intentionally performed, when the alleged injury results from an unforeseen cause that is out of the ordinary expectations of a reasonable person, the injury may be covered by an occurrence policy provision. In such a context, the dispositive issue in determining whether an accidental injury occurred is not whether the action undertaken by the insured was intended, but rather whether the resulting harm is alleged to have been a reasonably anticipated consequence of the insured's intentional act. Thus, resolution of the issue of whether Kivalina's Complaint alleges an occurrence covered by the policies turns on whether the Complaint can be construed as alleging that Kivalina's injuries, at least in the alternative, resulted from unforeseen consequences that a reasonable person would not have expected to result from AES's deliberate act of emitting carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases.</blockquote>The <span class = "casename">Kivalina v. Exxon Mobil Corp.</span> appeal was filed in the <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in November 2009 after a district court's <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8475485648638796860&q=Kivalina+v.+Exxonmobil+Corp&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&as_vis=1">dismissal</a> [opinion text] on standing. The district court ruled that, being a political question, the courts could not intervene. Kivalina, an Alaskan village, is alleging that their village is being destroyed due to rising sea levels, a consequence of global warming.

<p>In July, the UN <a href = "http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] made its first official <A href = "/paperchase/2011/07/security-council-declares-global-warming-threat-to-international-security.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] implicating climate change as a serious threat to world peace and security. At the urging of Germany, which released a <a href = "http://www.new-york-un.diplo.de/Vertretung/newyorkvn/en/__pr/Press_20releases/PM__2011/110719_20Impact_20of_20Climate_20Change.html?archive=2990092">Concept Note</a> [text] to lead the discussion, the Security Council debated global warming for the first time since 2007. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-states-global-warming-suit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-174">American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> [text] displace claims made under the federal common law of nuisance regarding whether electric utilities contributed to global warming. All eight justices agreed in rejecting the claims by eight states, New York City and three private land trusts invoking the federal common law for public nuisance against four power companies and the <a href="http://www.tva.gov/">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (TVA) [official website]. The plaintiffs sought to control greenhouse gas emissions by creating a annually declining cap on emissions. The court held that to challenge greenhouse gas emissions the plaintiffs may file petitions for rulemaking with the EPA to set emissions standards. Currently, the EPA is undergoing rulemaking on the issue and is set to issue new standards by May 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ordinance prohibited individuals from standing on a street or highway to solicit "employment, business, or contributions" from passing motorists. The city argued that the purpose of the ordinance was to improve traffic safety and flow at busy intersections. Plaintiffs, which included the <a href="http://www.ndlon.org/">National Day Laborer Organizing Network</a> (NDLON) [advocacy website], argued that the ordinance was a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1afrag1_user.html#amdt1a_hd4">First Amendment</a> [text] and prevented day laborers from seeking employment. Citing <a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1982/1982_81_896">Perry Education Association v. Perry Local Educators' Association</a> [Oyez summary], the court stated that the city was free to limit the time, place and manner of expression only if the regulation was narrowly tailored and left open "ample alternative channels of communication." The court determined that the ordinance failed to satisfy the narrow tailoring element because it regulated "significantly more speech" than necessary to achieve the city's stated purpose. The city could achieve the same goals by engaging in less restrictive measures, such as enforcing traffic laws at busy intersections. The <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy website], which represented the plaintiffs, <a href="http://www.maldef.org/news/releases/ninthcircuitruling_dlr/">applauded the ruling</a> [statement] as a "strong precedent on day laborer rights."<blockquote>Today's ... opinion resoundingly vindicates the First Amendment rights of day laborers throughout the western United States. The dozens of similar ordinances through out the region that purport to prevent day laborers from speaking on sidewalks are now even more plainly violative of the Constitution. ... The longstanding principle that the right of free speech belongs to everyone has been significantly bolstered by this decision.</blockquote>The <em>en banc</em> decision reverses a <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/06/09/06-55750.pdf">previous panel decision</a> [text, PDF] upholding the ordinance as constitutional.

<p>Rights groups have also asserted the free speech rights of day laborers in their challenge to Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/49leg/2r/laws/0113.htm">immigration reform bill</a> [SB 1070 text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], which provides similar restrictions on solicitation. In January, a coalition of six rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-coalition-seeks-to-block-additional-provisions-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] seeking to block the provisions, arguing that "solicitation speech is expression entitled to full protection under the First Amendment." Last month, the state of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-immigration-law-ruling-to-supreme-court.php">filed a petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] seeking to overturn a lower court decision enjoining four provisions of the immigration law. The provisions were blocked through a preliminary injunction order <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">issued</a> by the Arizona district court in 2010 and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST reports] by the Ninth Circuit in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Buck's appeal is not arguing his innocence, but rather improper practices during his sentencing hearing. A clinical psychiatrist testified that Buck, a black man, was more likely to commit another crime due to his race, and thus should be given the death penalty. The same psychiatrist had testified similarly in six other sentencing hearings that resulted in the death penalty, all of which have been overturned. The appeal alleges a violation of equal protection created when the prosecution asked leading questions to elicit racially-charged responses and when then-attorney general <a href = "http://cornyn.senate.gov/public/">John Cornyn</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/us/racial-bias-found-in-six-more-capital-cases.html">guaranteed sentencing rehearings</a> [NYT report] in the seven cases. Under Cornyn's administration, six of the rehearings took place, but his successor, <a href = "https://www.oag.state.tx.us/">Greg Abbott</a> [official website], has not conducted one for Buck.<blockquote>Of the seven individuals whose death sentences the Attorney General had identified as having been obtained in violation of equal protection, Mr. Buck is the only one who has not been resentenced at a trial free from consideration of his race as a basis for imposing death. The only change that has taken place since the Attorney General identified Mr. Buck's case as being similar to the Saldano case is that a different person now holds the position of  Attorney General. That is an insufficient legal basis on which to treat Mr. Buck differently from the six other cases that the former Attorney General had identified as being similar. Capriciousness in the administration of the death penalty is intolerable. Mr. Buck has been twice-subjected to equal protection violations, once when the government asked the jury to sentence him to death, and a second time when the government arbitrarily treated him differently from similarly situated defendants. Texas promised to remedy Mr. Buck's racially-based death sentence, then reneged on that promise, then hid its promise from the federal courts to avoid its enforcement in Mr. Buck's case.</blockquote>Buck's legal team has lost appeals in all courts lower than the Supreme Court as well as an appeal of clemency to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. It is unknown when the court will accept or deny <em>certiorari</em>.

<p>The Supreme Court received international criticism for not staying a Texas execution earlier this year. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] criticized the US execution of Mexican national <a href="http://www.humbertoleal.org/">Humberto Leal Garcia</a> [advocacy website], saying that the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-us-execution-of-mexico-national-violated-international-law.php">sentence violated international law</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay said that the US <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11214&LangID=E">denied consular access</a> [press release] to Leal Garcia, which was his right under <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf">Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations</a> [text, PDF]. Although the State of Texas convicted and sentenced Leal Garcia for murder in 1998. The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution-of-mexican-national.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to stay the execution, with the majority in a split <em>per curiam</em> opinion rejecting the Obama administration's arguments that Leal Garcia's execution would be detrimental to foreign policy to the degree that they needed to introduce a stay. Texas officials <a href="http://www.ktsm.com/news/texas-executes-mexican-after-court-stay-rejected">executed</a> [KTSM report] Leal Garcia an hour after the decision. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement stemmed from statistics in the annual <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv10.pdf">National Crime Victimization Survey</a> [text, PDF], which consists of self-reported information and is complied by the <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> [official website] to estimate the rates and level of criminal victimization including violent victimization, property victimization and personal theft. According to the report, this decrease is in line with the trend of declining victimization, with both violent and property victimizations at their lowest levels since the early 1990s. The rather dramatic drop in violent victimization is attributed to a decrease in the number of simple assaults, which saw a 15 percent decline from 2009. The report for 2010 also differed from previous years in its indication that for the first time males and females experienced similar rates of victimization with males historically experiencing higher numbers.

<p>Rates of violent crime along the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/systems/mexico-wall.htm">US-Mexico border</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] have also been <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/violent-crime-rate-along-us-mexico-border-declining-usa-today.php">declining for several years</a> [JURIST report], according to a USA Today analysis released in July. The study indicated that, on average, US border cities were safer than other cities in the same states, with border cities maintaining lower crimes rates than the national average. Federal crime statistics, interviews and crime data from over 1,600 local law enforcement agencies in four border states, as well as demographic figures from the US Census Bureau's <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/">American Community Survey</a> [official website], form the basis of the study. The analysis suggests that the US-Mexico border may not be as dangerous as the general US population perceives. For example, according to the study, murder and robbery rates for cities within 50 miles of the border were lower than the respective state average in nearly every year from 1998 to 2009. Critics of the study are concerned that the analysis does not accurately reflect the true landscape of violent crime in border cities and fails to take into consideration those crimes that go unreported, particularly kidnapping and extortion. Several analysts quoted in the report, however, argue that the analysis confirms that politicians have exaggerated the extent to which violence occurs along the US-Mexico border and make unsubstantiated claims linking illegal immigration to crime rates. </p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result of the guilty verdict, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/egyptian-court-sentences-mubarak-era-tourism-minister-to-3-years-in-jail-for-corruption/2011/09/18/gIQAAmDubK_story.html">court sentenced him to three years in prison</a> [AP report]. The conviction of Garanah, a businessman before joining Mubarak's cabinet, closely followed that of Ahmed Ezz, who was also highly involved in the ruling party and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/egypt-court-sentences-former-mubarak-associates-on-corruption-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on Friday on charges of corruption. Garanah is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-court-convicts-former-tourism-minister-for-corruption.php">currently serving five years</a> [JURIST report] in jail after an Egyptian criminal court in May found that he had sold public land in the Red Sea province below market value to two businessmen. The two businessmen were also found guilty <em>in absentia</em> and also received five-year sentences. The court said that Garranah had illegally allocated the public land to the private developers. He will now serve the longer of the two sentences. His May sentence made him the second high-ranking state official to be found guilty of corruption since Mubarak was forced from office last February; however, a number of other ministers and businessmen involved with the regime continue to be detained and tried, including Mubarak, the resumption of whose trial earlier this month, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mubarak-trial-resumed-amid-courtroom-violence.php">marked by violence in the courtroom</a> [JURIST report].

<p>While many of these trials end in convictions, in July, an Egyptian court acquitted three former ministers under Mubarak on charges of misappropriating state funds. The Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/egypt-ministers-acquitted-on-charges-of-misappropriating-state-funds.php">found three ministers not guilty</a> [JURIST report]: Ahmed Maghrabi, former minister of housing, Yousef Boutros-Ghali, former minister of finance, and former minister of information Anas el-Fiqqi. This verdict was the first time former ministers of Mubarak have been found not guilty on corruption charges. The court did sentence former trade minister Rachid Mohammed Rachid in absentia for squandering public funds and profiteering. Maghrabu and Boutros-Ghali will remain in custody as they are facing other charges. The decision was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hF_3CbePBKnTPvj2SDvN9i-otklg?docId=dd76a80d62da45d2be7affd4cdcefffc">not well received by many Egyptians</a> [AP report] who feel that the Cairo criminal court is rushing corruption trials while failing to bring more cases for human rights abuses against protesters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A Venezuelan anti-corruption official had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/18/hugo-chavez-criticizes-court_n_968138.html">barred Lopez</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] from running for office after conducting a corruption investigation in 2005. Chavez called the IACHR ruling <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2011/0918/In-Venezuela-top-Chavez-rival-sounds-confident-note-after-key-court-victory">politically motivated</a> [CSM report]. He further claimed that the Costa Rica-based international court is part of a system that protects corrupt behavior and is influenced by the US and the wealthy. The Venezuelan presidential primary election, where voters will select an opposition leader to challenge Chavez, will be held in February, and the presidential election will be held in October 2012.

<p>The Venezuelan government and the IACHR are often in disagreement. In June 2010, the IACHR sent a letter to the Venezuelan government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-commission-concerned-over-freedom-of-expression-in-venezuela.php?goback=.nvr_3014631_2">expressing concern</a> [JURIST report] over the <a href="http://www.cidh.org/relatoria/showarticle.asp?artID=800&amp;lID=1">increasing threat to freedom of expression</a> [press release] in the country, citing three recent cases that caused particular concern. In February 2010, the IACHR released a <a href="http://cidh.org/countryrep/Venezuela2009eng/VE09.TOC.eng.htm">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/venezuela-government-violating-basic.php">report</a>] providing a detailed analysis on the state of human rights in Venezuela, which ultimately concluded that not all citizens are ensured full enjoyment of their basic human rights. The top Venezuelan human rights official <a href="g/paperchase/2010/02/venezuela-rights-chief-disputes.php">criticized the report</a> [JURIST report] and said that the report makes unfair characterizations and undermines Venezuelan democracy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-files-antitrust-suit-to-block-att-t-mobile-merger.php">filed by the DOJ in August</a> [JURIST report], cites the important role T-Mobile has played in keeping prices down by creating pressure on the other large carriers, including not only AT&#38;T, but also <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/">Verizon Wireless</a> and <a href="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint Nextel</a> [corporate websites]. New York <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2011/sep/sep16a_11.html">announced his decision</a> [press release] to join the DOJ lawsuit on behalf of New York, saying the merger would have a negative impact and should be barred:<blockquote>This proposed merger would stifle competition in markets that are crucial to New York's consumers and businesses, while reducing access to low-cost options and the newest broadband-based technologies. We must do everything we can to encourage innovation and job creation. In vulnerable upstate communities, where concentration in some markets is already very high, and in New York City's information-intensive economy, the impact this merger would have on wireless competition, economic growth, and technological innovation would be enormous.</blockquote>In its response to the suit, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/att-responds-to-doj-antitrust-lawsuit.php">filed last week</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], AT&#38;T argued that acquiring T-Mobile will allow it to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/t-defends-t-mobile-deal-response-doj-suit-221644241.html">provide better services to its customers</a> [AP report] as a result of the expansion of its mobile network. In addition, AT&#38;T contends that smaller, regional carriers will act as alternatives to consumers and thus not allow the market to be completely dominated by itself, Verizon and Sprint. The case is set to be heard on September 21.

<p>The worldwide consolidation of media is an ongoing global concern. In August, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-major-publishers-of-collusion.php">class action lawsuit was filed</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.apple.com/startpage/">Apple</a> [corporate website] and five major publishers for allegedly colluding to illegally fix electronic book (e-book) prices. Communication Director for Free Press, Dave Saldana <a href="/hotline/2011/07/dave-saldana-news-corp.php">argued last July</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the proposed AT&#38;T/T-Mobile deal is an example of the enormous influence large media corporations can bring to bear through massive public relations blitzes and the acquisition of political influence through the pouring of money into lobbying efforts and campaign contributions. Saldana said that, for these reasons, AT&#38;T remains confident that its T-Mobile purchase will go through, "because it knows it has several hundred million reasons to push for the merger, and millions of means to get it." Saldana warned that media consolidation is dangerous because it gives the companies leverage to sway public opinion and dominate the narrative when their own practices are questioned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The man, Shefqet Kabashi, was <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10808">sentenced to two months in jail</a> [press release] for refusing on two occasions to answer questions during the 2007 trial related to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5165042.stm">1998-1999 war in Kosovo</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kosovo+War">news archive</a>]. Kabashi pleaded guilty in August to charges that he "knowingly and willfully interfered with the Tribunal's administration of justice" by refusing to answer questions as a witness against former Kosovo prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4329091.stm">Ramush Haradinaj</a> [BBC profile]. During sentencing, Judge Alphons Orie chided Kabashi for withholding what could have been important testimony, saying "By contumaciously refusing or failing to answer questions as a witness, Mr Kabashi deprived the Haradinaj et al. Trial Chamber of evidence relevant for an effective ascertainment of truth in the adjudication of that case." Both sides have the right to appeal, but it is not immediately clear whether either will do so. 

<p>Haradinaj was <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-acquits-former-kosovo-pm-of-war.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] by the ICTY in 2008 of charges murder, rape, torture, abduction, cruel treatment, imprisonment and the forced deportation of civilians allegedly in connection with his position as a senior commander in the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/kla.htm">Kosovo Liberation Army</a> (KLA) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder].

The referendum, entitled Help Instead of Punishment, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/liechtenstein-rejects-plan-legalize-abortion-133712436.html">would have decriminalized abortion</a> [AP report] in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy or if the child is severely disabled. According to official count, 52.3 percent of voters voted against the referendum, while 47.7 percent voted in favor of the proposed change. Under the current law, women who get an abortion can be sentenced to up to one year in prison, and doctors who perform the procedure can be sentenced to up to three years in prison. Abortions may only be performed in the country to save the life of the mother or if the mother was under age 14 when she became pregnant. A counter proposal is expected to come before the <a href="http://www.liechtenstein.li/index.php?id=20&L=1">Liechtensten Parliament</a> [official website, in German] soon. Under the counter proposal, abortion would still be a crime, but it would no longer be punished. 

<p>Abortion rights has been a contentious issue in the international community with many advocacy groups criticizing countries with restrictive policies regarding the procedure. In August 2010, the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-group-calls-philippines-abortion-ban-human-rights-crisis.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the restrictive abortion laws of the Philippines as a "human rights crisis," resulting in the death of thousands of women annually. In January 2010, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] argued that <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-group-criticizes-ireland.php">Ireland's restrictive abortion laws increase health risks to women</a> [JURIST report] and expose them to deliberate misinformation about abortion procedures. Ireland's current legislation prohibits abortion for any reason except when the mother's life is threatened and carries a potential sentence of life imprisonment. In July 2009, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called on Nicaragua to <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/rights-group-urges-revision-of.php">end its total ban on abortions</a> [JURIST report], calling for the country to eliminate severe criminal punishments for those who seek or perform abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Padilla and co-defendants Adham Hassoun and Kifah Jayyousi had appealed their convictions, and federal prosecutors appealed the sentence given by US district court judge Marcia Cooke. Upholding all three convictions and ordering a new sentencing hearing for Padilla, the court explained:<blockquote>[T]he district court "commit[ted] a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors." The district court attached little weight to Padilla's extensive criminal history, gave no weight to his future dangerousness, compared him to criminals who were not similarly situated, and gave unreasonable weight to the conditions of his pre-trial confinement.</blockquote>Specifically, the court noted Padilla's 17 prior arrests and objected to a reduction of his sentence for the three-and-a-half years he was detained as an "enemy combatant" on a base in South Carolina before charges were brought against him. Dissenting judge Rosemary Barkett opposed overturning the sentence because doing so "simply substitutes this court's sentencing judgment for that of the trial judge." Padilla's attorney has indicated he intends to appeal for a rehearing<em> en banc</em> by the Eleventh Circuit or to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>Jose Padilla has been the focus of much litigation since his <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/09/19/national/main20108308.shtml">arrest in 2002</a> [AP report] on suspicion of conspiracy to detonate a "dirty bomb"&#8212;a conventional explosive surrounded by radioactive material. In June, Padilla <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-appeals-dismissal-of-padilla-unlawful-detention-suit.php">appealed the dismissal of his lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against government officials over his detention in a military prison, which he claims was unlawful, and that he was subjected to torture, denied communication with his family or lawyers, denied ability to practice his religion and denied appropriate medical care. In June 2009, a federal judge in San Francisco <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss.php">allowed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-sues-law-professor-who-helped.php">lawsuit filed</a> [JURIST reports] by Padilla to move forward against University of California Berkeley law professor <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=235">John Yoo</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">news archive</a>], the author of controversial US government memos arguing that detained enemy combatants could be denied Geneva Conventions protections against torture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Notably, while the overall incidents of violent crime dropped nationwide, major <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/19/us-usa-crime-idUSTRE78I38020110919">cities in the Northeast experienced double-digit increases</a> [Reuters report] in the number of murders, including Boston, New York and Newark, New Jersey.

With the repeal of the law, the military can no longer prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly among its ranks. The occasion was marked by statements of commemoration from various government agencies, as well as individual officials. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/20/statement-president-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell">statement</a> [text] celebrating the fact that "patriotic Americans in uniform will no longer have to lie about who they are in order to serve the country they love." The <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://usarmy.vo.llnwd.net/e2/c/downloads/220461.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF], signed by three of its highest ranking officials, heralding the end of the controversial law:
<blockquote>From this day forward, gay and lesbian Soldiers may serve in our Army with the dignity and respect they deserve. Our rules, regulations and policies reflect the repeal guidance issued by the Department of Defense and will apply uniformly without regard to sexual orientation, which is a personal and private matter.</blockquote>The letter also highlighted the training military personnel have received in preparation for the change. <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] press secretary George Little said that that the military is adequately prepared for the end of the current policy, with approximately 97 percent of the military having undergone specific DADT repeal preparation. Various Washington leaders have scheduled news conferences for later Tuesday. At the Pentagon, <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] and the <a href="http://www.jcs.mil/biography.aspx?ID=9">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen</a> [official profile] will field questions about the repeal, while a bipartisan group of congressional supporters of the repeal will be answering questions on Capitol Hill.

<p>The repeal took effect as scheduled despite opposition from some. Four days before the repeal was scheduled to go into effect, two Republican Congressmen sent a letter to Panetta <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/house-gop-members-attempting-to-delay-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">asking to delay the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DADT. Earlier this month, lawyers for the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official websites] to overturn a ruling that the DADT policy is a violation of service members' constitutional rights, arguing that the impendency of repeal renders the original court decision moot. In July, the Ninth Circuit ruled that DADT <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-again-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">would remain partially in effect</a> [JURIST report] during the 60 days prior to its newly-scheduled repeal. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">effectively reiterated its order issued</a> [JURIST report] the previous week, in which it reinstated DADT but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy.

The former Russian oil company, Yukos Oil, filed suit against the country alleging that it forced the company into liquidation through unfair taxation practices. In 2003, Russian officials arrested former Yukos Oil owner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] and his business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website] on charges of fraud and tax evasion. The court ruled that Russia violated Article 1 and Article 6 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/EnglishAnglais.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] in relation to its tax assessment proceedings against Yukos and by giving the company insufficient time to prepare its case before the lower courts. The court did not determine an award of damages and costs. Yukos sought recovery of USD $98 billion, the largest claim in the history of the ECHR. The ruling may be appealed by either party, but it is not immediately clear if either will do so. 

<p>Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] in the <a href="http://hamovnichesky.msk.sudrf.ru/">Khamovinchesky District Court</a> [official website, in Russian] on charges connected with embezzling more than $27 billion from Yukos Oil. Prior to this conviction, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were already <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">serving eight-year prison sentences for fraud and tax evasion</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/">Supreme Court of Russia</a> [official website, in Russian] ruled that Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/khodorkovsky-was-illegally-detained-russia-supreme-court.php">illegally detained</a> [JURIST report] for their trial last year, a symbolic victory for the pair that will have no effect on their sentences. International human rights organizations and numerous governments <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">guilty verdict</a> [JURIST reports]. Last year, former Russian prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister Vladimir Putin [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the <a href="http://kprf.ru/">Communist Party</a> [party website, in Russian] without first getting approval to do so from the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.akclu.org/">ACLU of Alaska</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="http://www.akclu.org/NewsEvents/Schmidt.Complaint.2010.08.03.pdf">challenged</a> [complaint, PDF] the state's tax exemption law on behalf of three same-sex couples in Anchorage who were <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/09/20/business-us-same-sex-couples-taxes_8689519.html">denied tax benefits</a> [AP report] for lacking marital status. The complaint alleged that Alaska's Constitution forbids discrimination against same-sex domestic partners in qualifications for tax exemptions. The complaint further alleged that denying tax exemptions to same-sex couples infringed on the plaintiffs' natural right to liberty, equal rights, opportunities, and protection under the law, as well as the right to be free from sex discrimination, and the right to privacy. Pfiffner found that the denial violates the equal protection clause of the <a href="http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/folioproxy.asp?url=http://wwwjnu01.legis.state.ak.us/cgi-bin/folioisa.dll/acontxt/query=*/doc/{t1}?">Alaska Constitution</a> [text]. 

<p>Rights for same-sex couples continue to be debated across the US. Last week, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/new-york-ag-seeks-dismissal-of-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging the validity of the state's newly passed <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Marriage Equality Act</a> [JURIST report]. Also last week, the North Carolina Legislature approved putting a constitutional amendment to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/north-carolina-legislature-approves-ballot-measure-to-ban-same-sex-marriage.php">ban same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] on a statewide ballot to be voted on in May. Earlier this month, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-arizona-same-sex-couples-insurance-benefits-temporarily.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that House Bill 2013, a law rescinding health benefits for same-sex couples in the public sector, is in violation of the equal protection clause of the US Constitution. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Obama has faced criticism for not closing Guantanamo after issuing an <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/gitmo_final_exec_order.pdf">executive order</a> [text, PDF] in January 2009 directing that the military prison be <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">closed</a> [JURIST report] "as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date of this order." However, Congress blocked the executive order and barred the transfer of detainees to the US.

The award will not be granted immediately, <a href = "http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/09192011_chevronstatementonunitedstatessecondcircuitcourtofappealsorder.news">pending appeals in Ecuador</a> [press release] and a decision by the <a href = "http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=363">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website; <A href = "http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1408">case materials</a>] in The Hague. The court also issued a stay on a planned hearing in November and rejected the Ecuadorians' motion to recuse Judge Lewis Kaplan for bias. Chevron was unfazed by the ruling, insisting they are the victims of fraud: "There is no legitimate evidence supporting any finding of liability against Chevron because Texaco Petroleum Company cleaned up its share of environmental impacts in Ecuador and the remaining impacts are the responsibility of the government of Ecuador and its state-owned oil company, Petroecuador." Representatives for the Ecuadorians made <a href = "http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/20/1/1447/demandantes-aplauden-fallo-destraba-caso-contra-chevron.html">several statements</a> [<em>El Universo</em> report, in Spanish] praising the decisions, and accusing Chevron of <A href = "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/09/19/BU5B1L6N82.DTL">valuing sensationalism over law</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report].

<p>Damages were initially <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">awarded in February</a> [JURIST report] by the Provincial Court of Sucumbios in Ecuador, finding that Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, polluted large areas of the country's rain forest. That month, Chevron filed a lawsuit against plaintiffs' lawyers and consultants in the case, claiming that professionals for the plaintiffs were attempting to extort Chevron. The damages were then enjoined in New York in March. In July, the Second Circuit <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/16/entertainment/la-et-crude-20100716">upheld</a> [LAT report] a May <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/judge-rules-that-filmmaker-must-give-footage-to-chevron/">ruling</a> [NYT report] by the Southern District of New York ordering filmmaker Joe Berlinger to turn over to Chevron certain outtakes from his 2009 documentary <a href="http://www.crudethemovie.com/">Crude</a> [film website]. Chevron claims the outtakes show plaintiffs' lawyers discussing illegal and unethical tactics, including ghost-writing a court appointed expert's report, intimidating a judge and colluding with government officials. Chevron claims that a 1995 cleanup agreement between Ecuador and Texaco, completed in 1998 at a cost of $40 million, absolves Chevron of all liability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although Belarus is an active member of the UN and has ratified many of its human rights policies, Pillay noted a sharp deterioration in human rights since the 2010 disputed re-election of <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">President Alexander Lukashenko</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Lukashenko">news archive</a>] who has been in power for 17 years since his 1994 election. Pillay said that citizens have been discouraged from protesting and have not received fair trials, and she referenced the administration enforcing "a policy of harassment against non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and human rights defenders." The report also cited Belarus as the only European nation to still enforce the death penalty. Pillay recommended the immediate release of political prisoners, an end to harassment of human rights and NGOs, an investigation into alleged abuses of the judicial system and the acceptance of an <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] mission to the country. In response, ambassador Mikhail Khvostov for Belarus said his country <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39629&Cr=belarus&Cr1=">disagrees on what constitutes a peaceful demonstration</a> [UN News Centre report] and that Belarus is committed to human rights.

<p>Last month, members of the Belarus Parliament introduced a bill that would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/belarus-lawmakers-move-to-ban-silent-protests.php">ban so-called "silent protests"</a> [JURIST report], including those involving large groups of people basically doing nothing. Nonetheless, <a href = "http://rt.com/news/belarus-silent-protest-opposition-971/">silent protests continue</a> [RT report], largely in defiance of Lukashenko. Earlier this year, Belarus' Minsk City Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-delivers-suspended-sentences-to-2-presidential-candidates-for-inciting-riots.php">delivered suspended sentences</a> for two former presidential candidates, Uladzimer Nyaklyaeu and Vital Rymasheuski, convicted of organizing <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/us-and-eu-condemn-arrests-and-violence-after-belarus-elections.php">protests following the re-election</a> [JURIST reports] of Lukashenko. The two-year suspended sentences were handed down days after former presidential candidate <a href = "http://www.freebelarusnow.org/en/component/k2/item/43?ml=1">Andrey Sannikau</a> [Free Belarus Now profile] was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/belarus-presidential-candidate-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-inciting-riots.php">sentenced to five years</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <A href = "/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports]. While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US State Department has historically <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href = "/paperchase/2007/11/un-committee-concerned-about-belarus.php">UN General Assembly Third Committee</a> and the <a href = "/paperchase/2007/03/soviet-style-rights-abuses-widespread.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> [JURIST reports] have similarly denounced Belarus for human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The execution, which had been scheduled for Tuesday evening, was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/us-supreme-court-halts-3rd-texas-execution-try-of-ex-army-recruiter-for-rape-slaying-of-woman/2011/09/20/gIQAcaowiK_story.html">stayed for the third time</a> [AP report] and will remain so until the court decides whether to grant <em>certiorari</em> in the case. Foster was convicted of the murder and subsequent attempt to dispose of the body of a young woman in Texas in 2002, but he maintains that he is innocent and argues ineffective counsel resulted in his conviction. Prior to Tuesday's order, his execution was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-stays-texas-execution.php">most recently stayed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2011.

<p>This is the second time this month the Supreme Court has blocked a Texas execution, pending a decision on <em>certiorari</em>. Last week, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-stays-texas-execution.php">ordered a stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] for Duane Buck. Buck's appeal is not arguing his innocence, but rather improper practices during his sentencing hearing. A clinical psychiatrist testified that Buck, a black man, was more likely to commit another crime due to his race, and thus should be given the death penalty. The same psychiatrist had testified similarly in six other sentencing hearings that resulted in the death penalty, all of which have been overturned. The appeal alleges a violation of equal protection created when the prosecution asked leading questions to elicit racially-charged responses and when then-attorney general <a href="http://cornyn.senate.gov/public/">John Cornyn</a> [official website] guaranteed sentencing rehearings in the seven cases. Under Cornyn's administration, six of the rehearings took place, but his successor, <a href="https://www.oag.state.tx.us/">Greg Abbott</a> [official website], has not conducted one for Buck, whose legal team has lost appeals in all courts lower than the Supreme Court as well as an appeal of clemency to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. It is unknown when the court will accept or deny <em>certiorari</em>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In August of this year, Ware held a hearing over whether there was a compelling reason to keep the videos a secret. A group a lawyers, along with the <a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a> [corporate website], argued that the videos should be released. The trial judge had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last year that the trial could be broadcast live to five federal courthouses and posted to the court's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> [website] channel, but that decision was later <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-blocks-youtube-broadcast.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] by the US Supreme Court.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/california-high-court-hears-arguments-on-standing-in-proposition-8-case.php">oral arguments</a> on whether intervening advocacy groups can defend Proposition 8 in court, in response to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">certified question</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].

Additionally, the prosecutor has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14999929">requested acquittal</a> [BBC report] of the nine other individuals charged with Chirac. The charges against Chirac stem from his time as mayor of the city of Paris and accuse him of using public funds to support his political ambitions. The anti-corruption group <a href="http://anticor.org/">Anticor</a> [advocacy website, in French], whose lawyers exposed some of the ways in which the funds were allegedly misused, have highly criticized the prosecutor's request. Earlier this month, Chirac's legal team filed documents with the 11th Criminal Court of Paris <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/chirac-too-ill-to-attend-corruption-trial-lawyers.php">claiming Chirac is too ill to face his corruption trial</a>, only days before the trial was slated to continue <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-ex-president-chirac-goes-on-trial-for-corruption.php">after being delayed in March</a> [JURIST reports]. However, Judge Dominique Pauthe of the court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/chirac-absent-as-corruption-trial-proceeds.php">continue the proceedings without him</a> [JURIST report]. The trial is set to end on Friday with the judge still having the ability to deny the request and enter a guilty verdict.

<p>While Tuesday's request may result in an end to this trial, it would not be the end of Chirac's legal woes. Last week, the prosecutor's office <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/jurist-the-paris-prosecutors-office.php">began an inquiry into allegations</a> [JURIST report] against Chirac and his prime minister Dominique de Villepin over the receipt of millions of dollars from African leaders. The accusations against the two former French officials were made by a lawyer who worked as an aide to Chirac and claims to have participated in the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE78C0IE20110913?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">passage of over $20 million in cash</a> [Reuters report] from African leaders to be used as political donations. All of the alleged donations came from leaders of former French colonies. An investigation will also be launched by the Paris Bar into the actions taken by the accuser as his involvement with the passage of these funds is unethical within the legal profession. Villepin, like Chirac, had also been the subject of another trial, which involved accusations that he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/paris-appeals-court-acquits-ex-pm-villepin-in-slander-case/2011/09/14/gIQAs2LMRK_story.html">participated in a smear campaign</a> [AP report] against current <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/accueil.1.html">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French], but was recently acquitted. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Gertner should not have approached the reduction as a constitutional question, the appeals court ruled. A trial judge may reduce the penalty again, however, if the reduction is done in accordance with the common law practice of allowing the winning party to either pay the smaller amount or demand a new trial.

<p>The original 2009 ruling held that <a href="http://joelfightsback.com/">Joel Tenenbaum</a> [defense website] is liable for illegally downloading music. Four record companies, including <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com/">Sony BMG</a> and <a href="http://www.warnerbros.com/">Warner Brothers</a> [corporate websites], brought suit against Tenenbaum in the <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website], accusing him of <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/cyberone/files/2008/11/j-01-1.pdf">illegally downloading 30 songs</a> [complaint, PDF] in violation of copyright laws. Tenenbaum admitted to downloading hundreds of songs, and Gertner directed the jury to consider only the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/07/judge_rules_aga_1.html">amount of damages</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2010cv0651-83">151-page decision</a> [opinion, PDF], Judge John Bates rejected the arguments of officials representing Shelby County, Alabama, together with a corps of conservative activists, who claimed it is no longer constitutionally justifiable to subject Alabama and certain other states to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/about.php">Section 5</a> [DOJ backgrounder] "preclearance" rules under the VRA. These rules require covered jurisdictions to clear changes in voting districts, polling places and other electoral processes with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] or federal courts. Section 5 relies heavily on patterns of past discrimination to determine which state, county and local governments must obtain preclearance for election changes. After reviewing 15,000 pages of records supporting the 25-year extension of the VRA passed by Congress in 2006, Bates concluded that the modern existence of intentional racial discrimination in voting does in fact justify the 2006 reauthorization of the preclearance requirements:<blockquote>Despite the effectiveness of Section 5 in deterring unconstitutional voting discrimination since 1965, Congress in 2006 found that voting discrimination by covered jurisdictions had continued into the 21st century, and that the protections of Section 5 were still needed to safeguard racial and language minority voters. Understanding the preeminent constitutional role of Congress under the Fifteenth Amendment to determine the legislation needed to enforce it, and the caution required of the federal courts when undertaking the "grave" and "delicate" responsibility of judging the constitutionality of such legislation&#8212;particularly where the right to vote and racial discrimination intersect&#8212;this Court declines to overturn Congress's carefully considered judgment.</blockquote>The VRA was enacted to put an end to the systematic disenfranchisement of minority voters that ran rampant in Southern districts in the 1960s. According to a public <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/sec_5/covered.php">DOJ list</a> [materials], currently nine whole states and many individual counties and municipalities are Section 5 Covered Jurisdictions. The Senate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/washington/21vote.html">extended the act</a> [NYT report] in 2006 by an overwhelming 98-0 vote.

<p>The Arizona <A href = "http://www.azag.gov/">Attorney General</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-sues-federal-government-over-voting-rights-act.php">filed a similar suit</a> [JURIST report] in August seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Section 5 rules in that state. In 2009, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-322.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/supreme-court-upholds-voting-rights-act.php">report</a>] the Section 5 provisions of the VRA in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-322">Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The court voted 8-1 in favor of permitting the appellant municipality to "bail out" from the preclearance requirement if it can establish a history of compliance with the VRA, but declined to rule on the constitutionality of the 25-year extension of the act. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts opined that "things have changed in the South," observing that "[b]latantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare." The plaintiff was a municipal utility district in Texas that wanted to be exempted from the requirement and was challenging the most recent extension generally. At their enactment in 1965, the requirements were only supposed to be in place for five years. Section 5 has since been extended several times.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"Good Intentions Are Not Enough: The Struggle to Reform Liberia's Prisons" describes an otherwise determined government's failure to cope with the needs of its prisoners as it struggles to rebuild a country wracked by a 14-year civil war. In 2010 and 2011 AI delegates visited four of Liberia's 15 prison facilities, some more than once. From these observations AI concluded that prisoner conditions are so poor that they violate basic human rights, and some prisoners suffer permanent physical and/or mental health damage as a result. The cataloged problems listed in the report include severe overcrowding, grossly inadequate health services, inadequate food and drinking water, lack of adequate light, ventilation and time outdoors, poor hygiene and sanitation, and lack of basic necessities such as toiletries and clean bedding. Indeed, in some prisons overcrowding is such a problem that there is not even adequate floor space, let alone bedding, and prisoners must sleep in shifts because they cannot all lie down at the same time. The report notes that many of the identified problems are somewhat representative of conditions across the country's overall population, but that the state needs to provide a certain level of habitability for prisoners:<blockquote>It is true that some of these resource problems are also experienced by the general population in Liberia. However, prison inmates are under direct state control and completely dependent on the state to meet their most basic needs. Irrespective of resource constraints, the government must put in place a system that ensures the basic human rights of those in its custody. In all circumstances, the government has a clear and binding obligation not to expose prison inmates to conditions that constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.</blockquote>The report also notes that most prisoners have not been convicted of any crime and the vast majority are people living in poverty, without access to lawyers and with few financial resources. In July the AI delegates visited Monrovia Central Prison, the country's largest facility with a design capacity of 374 &#8212; they found a prisoner population of 839.

<p>Liberia has been elsewhere criticized for its poor human rights record in recent years. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33851&amp;Cr=liberia&amp;Cr1=">emphasized</a> [UN News Centre report] in a 2010 progress <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2010/88">report</a> [text, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/liberia-reconciliation-efforts-must.php">reconciliation in Liberia</a> [JURIST report] hinges on the development of its national security and its legal institutions. Along with poor prison conditions <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/liberia-facing-poor-human-rights.php">Liberia struggles</a> [JURIST report] with corruption in its criminal justice system and sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and forced marriage, according to a <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmil/">UN Mission in Liberia</a> [official website] combined quarterly <a href="http://www.unmil.org/documents/humanrights_may_oct_2007_report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released in April 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdeathpenalty.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The state of Georgia executed <a href="http://www.troyanthonydavis.org/">Troy Anthony Davis</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=troy+davis">news archive</a>] Wednesday night after his eleventh-hour appeal for clemency was <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/092111.zr.pdf">denied</a> [order, PDF] by the US Supreme Court. Davis was put to death by lethal injection, the three-drug cocktail that first put the condemned man in an induced coma through an administration of pentobarbital, followed by an injection of pancuronium bromide. Finally potassium chloride stopped his heart, and Davis was pronounced dead at 23:08 EST. From the time he was sentenced to death in 1991 Davis has maintained that he was wrongfully convicted of the murder of off-duty police officer Mark Allen MacPhail, the Savannah officer who was shot to death in 1989 in a parking lot while attempting to aid a homeless man who was being assaulted. Still proclaiming his innocence to the witnesses gathered around the execution chamber, Davis asked his family and friends to continue to search for truth in his case, which in the last decade has garnered significant support from advocacy groups around the world, in addition to high-profile individuals including former US president Jimmy Carter, Pope Benedict XVI and former FBI director William Sessions. Davis' prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of eyewitnesses, most of whom have recanted their testimony, and many of whom have signed affidavits swearing they were pressured or coerced by police, according to <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/cases/usa-troy-davis">Amnesty International USA</a> [advocacy website]. Additionally, nine individuals have signed affidavits implicating as the shooter another man who is also one of the two remaining witnesses who have not recanted their testimonies. Vigils and protests were held Wednesday night in the US and around the world.

<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.schr.org/about/who">Sara Totonchi</a> [profile] of the Southern Center for Human Rights <a href="/hotline/2010/09/uncertainty-in-davis-highlights-problems-with-death-penalty.php">warned</a> [JURIST comment] that the questions and doubts surrounding Davis' case would make his execution a travesty of justice. Her writing came a few weeks after the <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-court-denies-habeas-petition-in-davis-death-penalty-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Davis' <em>habeas corpus</em> petition even though the presiding judge noted numerous problems with the evidence presented by the State of Georgia in securing Davis' conviction. The Supreme Court had instructed the district court to examine new findings of fact in the case after taking the rare step of <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/supreme-court-orders-low-court-to.php">granting</a> [JURIST report] Davis' <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/davis-habeas-5-19-09.pdf">original writ of <em>habeas corpus</em></a> [cert. petition, PDF], despite Davis' exhaustion of his appeals under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ132.104">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [text]. A few weeks after the court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-rejects-davis-death.php">declined to grant <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in 2008, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/eleventh-circuit-grants-new-stay-of.php">granted a provisional stay of execution</a> [JURIST report], directing the parties to address through briefs whether Davis could meet the stringent requirements of federal law that would permit him to file a second <em>habeas corpus</em> petition for federal review of his case. In 2006, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org">American Bar Association</a> [association website] recommended a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/aba-recommends-georgia-death-penalty.php">moratorium on the death penalty in Georgia</a> and in <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/aba-calls-for-death-penalty-moratorium.php">Alabama</a> [JURIST reports] after an ABA panel study identified numerous flaws in the states' criminal justice systems that it claimed greatly compromised the fair administration of capital punishment. More recently a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-rules-florida-death-sentence-policy-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in June that Florida's death penalty procedures are unconstitutional, a holding <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/contact-dpic">Richard Dieter</a> [profile] of the Death Penalty Information Center says <a href="/hotline/2011/06/richard-dieter-florida-death-penalty.php">highlights the arbitrariness of the death penalty</a> [JURIST comment] and the problems with a state exacting an irreversible punishment. Additionally, in March of this year Illinois <a href = "http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] signed into law a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">abolished the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] in that state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The shooting killed 13 Northern Ireland civilians and wounded 15. The UK <a href="http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/">Bloody Sunday Inquiry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/uk-bloody-sunday-inquiry-concludes-casualties-were-unjustified.php">released an assessment</a> [JURIST report] in June of last year concluding that the attack by the British forces was unjustified. As a result, the UK <a href="http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/Home/">Ministry of Defence</a> (MoD) [official website] says it has written the lawyers representing the families of the victims, acknowledging their pain and offering monetary compensation. The inquiry, launched in 1998 by former prime minister <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/person/463/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder], concluded that British soldiers fired without warning on unarmed civilians during the illegal civil rights march taking place that day. The inquiry also found that the soldiers continued to shoot the civilians as they were fleeing the gunfire. During the original inquiry following the incident the military unit held that they were aiming at armed individuals who were allegedly <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ira.htm">Irish Republican Army</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] militants. This led the government to pay out only small amounts of compensation at the time. However the modern investigation concluded that the civilians were not armed and no soldiers had suffered injuries from return fire, and so additional compensation for the victims is warranted. Upon the release of the investigation findings current UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/statements-and-articles/2010/06/pm-statement-on-saville-inquiry-51888">apologized</a> [transcript] for the soldiers' malfeasance, stating that although the atrocity happened almost 40 years ago, the victims and their families still deserved an apology from the current government for the mistakes of those in the past. The MoD has yet to determine the exact amount of the payments to be made, and several families have stated they will refuse to accept the compensation. The victims' families had originally requested the investigation in order that their loved ones would be exonerated from being labeled IRA bombers and gunmen, and to hold the British contingent responsible for the unjustified killings.

<p>The Bloody Sunday inquiry is the longest and most expensive public investigation in British legal history. The government <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/bloody-sunday-inquiry-enters-final.php">deposed more than 900 witnesses</a> [JURIST report] in 432 days of testimony and took more than 1,500 written statements. The soldiers held responsible for the killings attempted to take action against the inquiry in 2004, arguing against the use of any standard below the criminal standard of proof because of the potential consequences facing them. Inquiry Chairman Lord Saville of Newdigate determined that the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2004/10/bloody-sunday-soldiers-may-take-court.php">tribunal would not use a criminal standard of proof</a> [JURIST report] to find if a soldier shot anyone without justification because the tribunal was merely investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths and issuing a report. The investigation came to fruition after the Irish government in 1997 produced new evidence that cast doubts on the conduct of the original tribunal established at the time of the incident, which labeled the victims as bombers and gunmen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday dismissed two cases filed by former Iraqi detainees who claimed they had been tortured by civilian contractors at the <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib prison</a> [JURIST news archive] near Baghdad. The three-judge panel ruled 2-1 to dismiss both cases, filed against contractors <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/091335.P.pdf">CACI International Inc.</a> and <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/101891.P.pdf">L-3 Services</a> [opinions, PDF], holding that federal law protecting civilian contractors acting under the control of the US military in a combat situation preempted the plaintiffs' tort claims based in state law. Circuit Judge Paul Neimeyer wrote the opinions and emphasized the importance of federal interests in the case:<blockquote>The potential liability under state law of military contractors for actions taken in connection with U.S. military operations overseas would similarly affect the availability and costs of using contract workers in conjunction with military operations. In this case, that uniquely federal interest was especially important in view of the recognized shortage of military personnel and the need for assistance in interrogating detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. Not only would potential tort liability against such contractors affect military costs and efficiencies and contractors' availability, it would also present the possibility that military commanders could be hauled into civilian courts for the purpose of evaluating and differentiating between military and contractor decisions. That effort could become extensive if contractor employees and the military worked side by side in questioning detainees under military control, as the complaint alleges in this case. Moreover, such interference with uniquely federal interests would be aggravated by the prison's location in the war zone. Finally, potential liability under state tort law would undermine the flexibility that military necessity requires in determining the methods for gathering intelligence.</blockquote>Circuit Judge Robert King filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to decide the issue of federal law preemption. 

<p>US military personnel have also been accused of torturing detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. <a href="/currentawareness/graner.php">Army Spc. Charles Graner</a> [JURIST news archive], the convicted ringleader of abuses committed at the prison, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/convicted-abu-ghraib-ringleader-released-early.php">released</a> [JURIST report] last month for good behavior after serving more than six-and-a-half years of his 10-year sentence. Graner was <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/breaking-news-graner-sentenced-to-10.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 of conspiracy, assault, maltreating prisoners, dereliction of duty and committing indecent acts and received the longest sentence of the six others involved in the abuses. In June, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] initiated a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-opens-grand-jury-investigation-of-abu-ghraib-homicide.php">grand jury investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the torture and death of a detainee at Abu Ghraib. Manadel Al-Jamadi was <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/cia-tried-to-cover-up-death-of.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] by US Navy SEALs in 2003 and held in Abu Ghraib as a "ghost detainee," or unregistered prisoner, for his suspected involvement in the bombing of a Red Cross center in Baghdad that killed 12 people. The US military has never revealed the exact circumstances of his death, which was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/dead-iraqi-prisoner-in-abu-ghraib.php">ruled a homicide</a> [JURIST report]. Reports show he died while suspended by his wrists, which were handcuffed behind his back.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Mahmoudi was sentenced to six months in prison for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15022757">illegal entering the country</a> [BBC report]. Al-Mahmoudi served as prime minister under <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [JURIST news archive] until Gaddafi was ousted during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] which began last February. Many senior officials of the Gaddafi regime <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/icc-requests-help-from-interpol-to-locate-gaddafi.php">remain at large</a> [JURIST report], including Gaddafi himself, his son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi.

<p>Last month Al-Mahmoudi requested that the UN create a "high-level commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">investigate alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website].  Although NATO was mandated by the UN to use force in order to stop Muammar Gaddafi from fomenting violence upon Libyan citizens, the campaign has allegedly gone beyond the scope of protecting civilians and recently led to the death of 85 civilians in one night after NATO forces bombed a residential area supposedly housing a rebel command center. In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">after it published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ECCC said that the separation of trials will allow the tribunal to <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/articles/severance-proceedings-ordered-case-002">deliberate more quickly</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/2">case</a> [materials] against the four elderly defendants. The first trial will focus on the beginning two phases of population movement and allegations of crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution not on religious grounds and forced disappearances associated with the first phases of population movement. Subsequent trials will focus on the third phase of population movement, genocide, persecution based on religious grounds and violation of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/index.jsp">Geneva Conventions of 1949</a> [ICRC backgrounder]. The ECCC supported its decision, saying: <blockquote>Separation of proceedings will enable the Chamber to issue a verdict following a shortened trial, safeguarding the fundamental interest of victims in achieving meaningful and timely justice, and the right of [the defendants] to an expeditious trial.</blockquote>The ECCC based its decision on an internal rule adopted earlier this year, which allows the tribunal to separate cases into smaller trials.

<p>Earlier this month, the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-concludes-fitness-hearing-for-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">concluded three days of hearings</a> [JURIST report] in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh to determine whether two of the four senior Khmer Rouge leaders were fit to stand trial on accusations of genocide and other war crimes. A court-appointed expert indicated that 79-year-old <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/ieng-thirith">Ieng Thirith</a> [ECCC backgrounder], the sister-in-law of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, suffered from dementia and memory loss and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i1Hw3req77Db1Lm_LgLuA7IzbRUw?docId=CNG.f17dd620575edb02954a7f8f0971f63b.13c1">needed additional psychiatric assessment</a> [AFP report]. The expert found no major concerns with 84-year-old "Brother Number Two" <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/nuon-chea">Nuon Chea</a> [ECCC backgrounder], though Chea contested the assessment. In May, a panel in the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ex-khmer-rouge-minister-denied-pre-trial-release.php">denied a motion for pretrial release</a> [JURIST report] by former Khmer Rouge official <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/ieng-sary">Ieng Sary</a> [ECCC backgrounder], 85, who served as deputy foreign minister under the regime during its reign in Cambodia from 1975-1979. Ieng's co-defendants Nuon Chea, Ieng Thirith and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> [ECCC backgrounder] have all challenged pretrial custody unsuccessfully. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/CTAPPS/">New York Court of Appeals</a> [official website] ruled Thursday that the <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a> [official website] was <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/CTAPPS/Decisions/2011/Sep11/217opn11.pdf">not liable</a> [text, PDF] for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center (WTC), finding governmental immunity. The plaintiffs argued that the operation of the parking garage was more akin to a proprietary, rather than governmental, function and thus qualified immunity should not apply. The court disagreed, stating that "[a]ny failure to secure the parking garage against terrorist attack predominantly derives from a failed allocation of police resources and thus" is considered to be a governmental function. The court explained:<blockquote>Despite the injurious results of the instant terrorist attack, the policy of the governmental immunity doctrine seeks to promote the proactive, deliberate, and informed security procedures that were developed here.  For example, the Port Authority solicited numerous expert opinions on the security risks and measures to be considered before allocating its police resources.  While the Port Authority's decision-making could have proceeded along different acceptable paths of action, in this case, it reached a reasoned discretionary conclusion to heighten security in sectors of the WTC considered more susceptible to harmful attack.  This is the type of assiduous behavior that governmental agencies should be encouraged to undertake in rendering informed decisions that involve the balancing of burdens and risks, competing interests, and allocation of resources.  To hold otherwise would create a disincentive for governmental agencies to investigate these types of security threats.  And to expose the Port Authority to liability because in the clarity of hindsight its discretionary determinations resulted in harm would engender a chilling effect on government and dissuade public entities from investigating security threats and exercising their discretion, especially in a time when the risk of terrorist attack is more apparent than ever before.</blockquote>This decision overturns the <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/ny-port-authority-found-negligent-in.php">2005 jury decision</a> [JURIST report] allocating 68 percent of the fault to the Port Authority for the terrorist attack.

<p>The 1993 bombing of the WTC by Islamic radicals, led by <a href="http://www.investigativeproject.org/profile/105">Ramzi Yousef</a> [IPT backgrounder], killed six and injured 1,000 through a car bomb placed in the basement parking garage of the WTC. Five men were captured and sentenced to life in prison for the attack. After the bombing, 648 plaintiffs filed 174 negligence actions against the Port Authority for "alleged breach of its proprietary duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition." Negligence was assessed against the Port Authority after documents revealed that the WTC garage had been ignoring safety fears since 1984. The Port Authority police superintendent, at the time, stated the parking areas "[we]re accessible to the public and are highly susceptible to car bombings." Yousef's uncle is <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/khalid_shaikh_mohammed.htm">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a> (KSM) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Shaikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>], the alleged mastermind behind the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=9/11">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. KSM was captured in 2003 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. In April US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that KSM and four others would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report] for their role in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hind Ahmas, 32, and Najate Nait Ali, 36, were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i21IPLF8VeGuU-1hEn8RXk2LAcgg?docId=CNG.3c65af283080425b1fc1866a26b9958a.421">stopped in May near the town hall</a> [AFP report] in Meaux where they were carrying an birthday cake for the mayor, Jean-Francios Cope&#8212;vocal advocate of the "burqa ban" and head of the ruling rightwing <a href="http://www.u-m-p.org/">UMP party</a> [official website, in French]&#8212;on the occasion on his birthday. The pair has indicated they will appeal to France's highest court, the <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French], and, if necessary, to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/Homepage_En/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], which would have implications across the continent. The judge issuing the fine is expected to publish his ruling explaining the decision.

<p>Since France passed its law in April, several other European countries have proposed or passed similar legislation. In August, an <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/italy-lawmakers-approve-draft-burqa-ban-law.php">Italian parliamentary commission approved a draft law</a> [JURIST report] that bans women from wearing full-face veils in public. In July, Belgium implemented a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-burqa-ban-takes-effect.php">banning women from wearing the burqa</a> [JURIST report] in public, with violators facing the possibility of fines or up to seven days in jail. A French <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-muslim-couple-to-challenge-burqa-ban-in-echr-spain-court-uupholds-city-ban.php">Muslim couple living in the UK filed a challenge</a> [JURIST report] in June in the ECHR over the French ban on full face coverings. Also in June, a Spanish court upheld a city ban on veils in municipal buildings for identification and security purposes. Last October, the French Constitutional Council ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ban conforms with the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Also in October, Dutch politician Geert Wilders said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition. In August 2010, Austria's conservative <a href="http://www.fpoe.at/">Freedom Party</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/conservative-austria-party-calls-for-vote-to-ban-minarets-face-veils.php">called for a special vote</a> [JURIST report] on whether to ban face veils and the construction of minarets, two of the most visible symbols of the Islamic faith. In July 2010, Spain's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/spain-lower-house-rejects-proposal-to-ban-burqa.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to ban the burqa and other full face veils by a vote of 183 to 162 with two abstaining.</p>]]></content:encoded>

An influential figure in the ruling <a href="http://www.pdk49.com/index.php?page=1,1">Democratic Party of Kosovo</a> (PDK) [official website, in Albanian], Limaj was <a href="http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/09/22/eu-judge-puts-kosovo-lawmaker-under-house-arrest/">excluded from a cabinet position</a> [VOA report] following international pressure not to include corrupt officials, but was elected into the Kosovo parliament.

In 2005, Limaj was acquitted of similar charges by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague because of insufficient evidence. The start date of the current trial remains unclear.

<p>EULEX has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">investigating war crimes</a> [JURIST report] since December 2008. Earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-kosovo-authorities-charge-10-for-war-crimes.php">EULEX charged 10 former members of the KLA</a> [JURIST report], including Fatmir Limaj, with war crimes for their actions during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo. In May 2010, EU police arrested a former member of the KLA for <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/eu-police-arrest-war-crimes-suspect-in-kosovo.php">suspected war crimes violations</a> [JURIST report]. A <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/eu-kosovo-court-issues-guilty-verdict.php">case came to trial</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009, resulting in a guilty verdict against a Kosovo Albanian for charges of murder, attempted murder and grievous bodily harm. The trial of two Serbian defendants was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/first-eu-kosovo-trial-blocked-by.php">derailed</a> [JURIST report] that month by hundreds of Serbian protesters and postponed indefinitely.

Kwoyelo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/uganda-charges-rebel-leader-in-first-war-crimes-trial.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in July by the <a href="http://www.judicature.go.ug/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=117&Itemid=154">International Crimes Division</a> (ICD) [official website] of the High Court of Uganda on 53 counts of willful killing, hostage taking, destruction of property and causing injury that took place during the country's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3514473.stm">civil war</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The Constitutional Court stated that because Kwoyelo had <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201109230113.html">renounced rebel activities</a> [All Africa report] he was entitled to amnesty, like everyone else who renounced the activities and were granted amnesty under the act. The court indicated that they were not interfering with the independence of the Amnesty Commission and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions because they still have the ability to prosecute those who refuse to renounce rebellion. They also emphasized that the act did not immunize all wrongdoers from prosecution. The prosecution in the case had argued that the Amnesty Act should be <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/ugandan-grants-lra-rebel-amnesty">declared unconstitutional</a> [RNW report] in order to end impunity for those who perpetrated violence during the civil war. Lawyers for Kwoyelo stated that the court's ruling was about fairness and equal treatment under the act. Kwoyelo, who was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/07/07/uganda-qa-trial-thomas-kwoyelo">taken into custody</a> [HRW backgrounder] in March 2009, joined the LRA in 1987 and allegedly participated in war crimes from 1992 through 2005 during his tenure as "colonel" of the rebel group. Kwoyelo has denied committing the crimes. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] said in May 2008 that it was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/icc-investigating-new-uganda-attacks-by.php">investigating possible new war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed by the LRA in recent attacks on Ugandan villages. In March 2008, the ICC said that <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/uganda-lra-rebel-arrest-warrants-remain.php">arrest warrants issued by the ICC for LRA leaders</a> [JURIST report] remain in effect, despite requests from Uganda that they be withdrawn. The four ICC-issued warrants were executed in 2005 and include LRA leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4320858.stm">Joseph Kony</a> and LRA senior member <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7083311.stm">Vincent Otti</a> [BBC profiles]. In 2007, Otti was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7156284.stm">executed by rebels</a> [BBC report], though official confirmation of his death was delayed until January amid fears that it would disrupt peace talks. Kony, who remains in hiding, is wanted for orchestrating the killing of thousands of civilians and the enslavement of thousands more children over two decades of conflict. The government has said that <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/uganda-officials-say-rebel-leader.php">Kony is willing to face trial at home</a> [JURIST report] but not at the ICC. Uganda <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/uganda-government-reaches-war-crimes.php">established the ICD</a> [JURIST report] in February 2008 to try the suspected war crimes perpetrators.

A subcommittee of HSAC was formed in June by the Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Janet Napolitano</a> [official website] and was asked to consider how US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] could improve the program. The subcommittee was specifically asked to address concerns relating to the use of racial profiling and how "to best focus on individuals who pose a true public safety or national security threat." The report states that there was strong agreement among the committee members that ICE should continue taking enforcement action against serious criminal offenders who are subject to deportation, but that ICE enforcement policy surrounding removal of minor offenders or those who have never been convicted of a crime continues causing confusion. This confusion, they maintain, has led to concerns surrounding the impact of the Secure Communities Program on community police procedures. The report states that ICE must clarify their goals with regards to the program, and accurately provide this information to participating jurisdictions. The committee also recommends that ICE implement "systematic mechanisms to ensure that Secure Communities adheres to its stated enforcement objective of prioritizing those who pose a risk to public safety or national security." Additionally, ICE is directed to improve the transparency of the program and to clarify that "individuals who are convicted of or charged with misdemeanors or other minor offenses are not top enforcement priorities unless there are other indicia that they pose a serious risk to public safety or national security." The <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] is also urged to take steps to improve the program, including strengthening remedies for civil rights violations. 

<p>The Secure Communities Program, as well as other aspects of the US immigration detention policy, have been heavily criticized by constitutional and immigration rights groups. In June, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] and a coalition of other rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-groups-reject-ice-changes-immigration-enforcement-program.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the changes announced by ICE to the program. The groups claimed Secure Communities undermines public safety, invites racial profiling and pulls non-citizens into what they call a "dangerous" system of detention and deportation. In March, the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-criticizes-us-immigrant-detention-system.php">report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that US immigration enforcement agencies are overly reliant on a flawed detention system. The IACHR investigated six immigrant detention centers based throughout Arizona and Texas. The report expressed concern over increased use of detention by the US government, citing a doubling in detention of non-citizens by ICE. It criticized the US government for viewing detention as a necessity and not as an exception in its enforcement. IACHR also found the average 30 day detentions troubling, arguing that it is likely to increase as backlogs of immigration cases increase. The report also criticized the lack of a genuine civil detention system and use of disproportionately restrictive penal and punitive measures during the detention period.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holmes is the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE78M14820110923?sp=true">second soldier to plead guilty</a> [Reuters report] of five who have been charged with murder as part of a plot contrived with fellow soldiers to kill Afghan civilians which took place between January and May of last year in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. Holmes told the court-martial, held at <a href="http://info.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/">Joint Base Lewis-McChord</a> [official website], that Specialist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morlock">Jeremy Morlock</a> [JURIST news archive], a co-defendant, "was up to no good" when he ordered soldiers to fire at the villagers. Morlock <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-solider-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March to three counts of murder, as well as one count each of assault, conspiracy, obstructing justice and illegal drug use in exchange for a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison. In a plea agreement between Army prosecutors and the private, Holmes admitted to pulling the trigger, but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2016289985_holmes23.html">pleaded not guilty</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] to previous charges of premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Holmes also pleaded guilty to one count each of possessing a finger bone and using marijuana. Holmes is likely to be sentenced later Friday.

<p>Investigations into the 5th Stryker Brigade have led to additional charges for lesser crimes against seven other soldiers. In May, US Army prosecutors charged Staff Sgt. David Bram with <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-army-charges-sixth-soldier-in-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">solicitation to commit premeditated murder</a> [JURIST report], failure to report crimes including murder, planting evidence near the body of an Afghan national, unlawfully engaging in murder scenario conversations with subordinates and aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon in related to the January 2010 murder plot. Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers following a plea agreement that will allow him to remain in the military after serving a nine-month sentence and testifying against other soldiers accused of terrifying civilians. A military investigation revealed that soldiers from the brigade had been plotting since 2009 to kill unarmed Afghans and stage them to look like casualties of combat. The probe into 12 soldiers regarding the civilian deaths <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">began in May 2010</a> [JURIST report]. These charges are the latest in a number of incidents involving US soldiers in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In April 2010, a military appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/us-military-appeals-court-overturns.php">reversed the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of US Marine Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III for the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian, citing lack of a fair trial. Hutchins was serving an 11-year sentence, <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/us-marine-sentenced-to-15-years-for.php">reduced from 15 years</a> [JURIST report], for his role in the April 2006 kidnapping and murder of an Iraqi civilian. In December 2009, former soldier Steven Green <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ex-us-soldier-appeals-civilian-trial-in.php">appealed his conviction</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the rape and murder of a 14-year old Iraqi girl.  Green was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-sentences-ex-us-soldier.php">five consecutive life terms</a> [JURIST report] in September 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the OHCHR, said "We are extremely alarmed by ongoing reports of the increasingly brutal crackdown by Syrian authorities against protestors in Syria. Prominent human rights defenders, inside and outside the country, are reported to have been targeted. We are also concerned by reports of the targeting and attacking of families and sympathizers of the protestors by security forces." Shamdasani cited a recent incident in which an 18-year-old woman was tortured and died while in custody after being kidnapped by members of the security forces. Shamdasani again emphasized that it is critical for the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> to refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites].

<p>Earlier this month, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said that at least 2,600 people have been killed in Syria in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-reports-syria-death-toll-at-2600.php">crackdown</a> [JURIST report] on anti-government protesters in the country. Last month, Pillay called on the UN Security Council to refer Syria to the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-chief-urges-syria-icc-probe.php">investigate the violent suppression of anti-government protests</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay's remarks came after the Fact-finding Mission in Syria published its 22-page report concluding that Syrian government forces cracking down on the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/syria-forces-may-be-committing-crimes-against-humanity-un-report.php">may be committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontgayrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/aclu-appears-federal-court-challenge-military-separation-pay-policy-discriminates">heard arguments</a> [ACLU press release] regarding a class action lawsuit challenging a government policy that halves severance pay of service members who have been honorably discharged for being gay. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/aclu-files-suit-over-military-discharge-pay-policy.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in November 2010 on behalf of all service members involuntarily discharged in the last six years who were otherwise eligible to receive full separation pay, but instead received only half as a result of the separation pay policy. The ACLU argues that the policy is discriminatory and unconstitutional, while the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] maintains that <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta</a> [official profile], and not the courts, has sole discretion to determine severance pay allocation. ACLU Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Project staff attorney Joshua Block said gay military members deserve equal benefits:<blockquote>The government is too embarrassed to defend the constitutionality of its policy in open court, so it is inventing new reasons to deny these service members justice. These veterans served their country honorably and deserve the full recognition and benefits that are afforded to other service members. The sums they seek are small to the military, but make a huge difference when readjusting to civilian life.</blockquote>Judge Christine Odell Cook Miller indicated that she would <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GAYS_IN_MILITARY_PAY?SITE=VOICESD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">likely permit the case to continue</a> [AP report] and will issue her official ruling on the government's motion to dismiss before October 15.

<p>The DOJ asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit just two days after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell-officially-repealed.php">repeal</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Don't Ask, Don't Tell</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>] officially <a href="http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_dadt/USD-PR-DADT_Repeal_Day_Memo_20Sep.pdf">took effect</a> [memo, PDF]. With the repeal of the law, the military can no longer prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly among its ranks. The separation pay policy, unlike DADT, can be changed without congressional approval. The repeal of DADT took effect as scheduled despite opposition from some. Four days before the repeal was scheduled to go into effect, two Republican Congressmen sent a letter to Panetta <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/house-gop-members-attempting-to-delay-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">asking to delay the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DADT. Earlier this month, lawyers for the DOJ asked the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to overturn a ruling that the DADT policy is a violation of service members' constitutional rights, arguing that the impendency of repeal renders the original court decision moot. In July, the Ninth Circuit ruled that DADT <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-again-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">would remain partially in effect</a> [JURIST report] during the 60 days prior to its newly-scheduled repeal. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">effectively reiterated its order issued</a> [JURIST report] the previous week, in which it reinstated DADT but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy. Hours earlier, Obama, Panetta and the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-certifies-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">certified DADT's repeal</a> [JURIST report], scheduling the policy to end on September 20. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed the bill to repeal</a> DADT [JURIST report] in December. The <a target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved in the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed </a>[JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The pressure on Haiti comes after AI released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR36/007/2011/en/c1eaace5-e98b-4d9c-b0b6-48dcbd7b75ae/amr360072011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] detailing human rights abuses that occurred under Duvalier's government. When Duvalier returned to Haiti in January 2011, Haitian authorities indicted him for embezzlement, theft of public funds and crimes against humanity committed during his presidency. According to a Special Adviser at Amnesty International, there is enough evidence to prosecute Duvalier for detentions, torture, deaths in custody, killings and disappearances that took place under his leadership. AI reported:<blockquote>Torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is a violation of international law. During Jean-Claude Duvalier's presidency, torture was used widely and systematically to extract confessions, to punish and to instil [sic] fear. Most of the information collected by Amnesty International concerning the torture and ill-treatment of detainees comes from the survivors themselves, or in the form of testimonies from fellow prisoners, who saw the marks and injuries of torture on the victims' bodies.</blockquote>The AI report recommends that Haiti apologize and respect the rights of the victims, conduct a thorough, effective and impartial investigation into human rights abuses, apply jurisprudence from national and international courts, and ratify human rights instruments.

<p>In July, the UN Deputy <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/aboutUs/Pages/DeputyhighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-wha Kang</a> [official profile] spoke on the importance of Haiti <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-urges-haiti-to-improve-rights-try-duvalier.php">improving its human rights record</a> [JURIST report], including trying Duvalier. Stressing the importance of rebuilding after Haiti's recent earthquake, Kang said reform must create a new focus on human rights and equality in the nation. Duvalier, also known as "Baby Doc," is the son of former Haitian leader Francois Duvalier, or "Papa Doc," whom he succeeded as leader in 1971. Following a tumultuous reign, which included accusations of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2003/07/01/some-alleged-torturers-living-exile">thousands of murders by his regime</a> [HRW report], Duvalier fled Haiti in 1986 and had since resided in France, until his return to Haiti in January. AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-to-probe-alleged-rights-violations-by-former-dictator-report.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Haitian authorities will investigate crimes committed against humanity allegedly committed under the rule of Duvalier during the 1970s and 80s.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/fact_sheet_bringing_flexibility_and_focus_to_education_law_0.pdf">new program</a> [fact sheet, PDF; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/23/obama-administration-sets-high-bar-flexibility-no-child-left-behind-orde">press release</a>] gives states flexibility in how they design their curriculum, provides schools relief from the "failing" designation and provides increased flexibility in how education funding is distributed. If states choose to opt into the new flexible standards, they are required to adopt new standards to promote college and career readiness and "set basic guidelines for teacher and principal evaluation and support systems." In explaining why the changes to the NCLB were necessary, Obama stated:<blockquote>And I want to say the goals behind No Child Left Behind were admirable, and President Bush deserves credit for that. Higher standards are the right goal. Accountability is the right goal. Closing the achievement gap is the right goal. And we've got to stay focused on those goals. But experience has taught us that, in its implementation, No Child Left Behind had some serious flaws that are hurting our children instead of helping them. Teachers too often are being forced to teach to the test. Subjects like history and science have been squeezed out. And in order to avoid having their schools labeled as failures, some states, perversely, have actually had to lower their standards in a race to the bottom instead of a Race to the Top. They don't want to get penalized? Let's make sure that the standards are so low that we're not going to be seen failing to meet them. That makes no sense.</blockquote>Some Republicans are questioning the president's ability to make such changes however. <a href="http://kline.house.gov/">John Cline</a> (R-MN) [official website], Chairman of the <a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/">House Committee on Education and the Workforce</a> [official website], <a href="http://edworkforce.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=261478">questioned</a> [press release] whether the Secretary of Education "has the authority to issue waivers of any statutory or regulatory requirement to state educational agencies and school districts." Obama stated that he is acting because Congress has failed to fix the NCLB and children can no longer afford to wait any longer.

<p>In June 2010 the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-no-child-left-behind-challenge.php">denied a petition for <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Pontiac School District v. Duncan</span>, which challenged whether the NCLB could impose requirements upon school districts without providing funding. As a result of the denial for <em>certiorari</em>, the case was dismissed. At the time, the Obama administration <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/09-852_bio.pdf">argued against granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [brief, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jennie Linn McCormack was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/31/us-abortion-idaho-idUSTRE77U2JP20110831">charged</a> [Reuters report] earlier this year under a 1972 Idaho state law that makes it a felony to end one's own pregnancy. McCormack had used a combination of FDA-approved abortion pills from an online source to terminate her pregnancy. After the case was dismissed for lack of evidence, McCormack <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/idaho-woman-challenges-state-anti-abortion-laws.php">filed suit</a> in August seeking to prevent prosecution of other women under the law and challenging the state's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">newly-enacted "fetal pain" statute</a> [JURIST reports].  McCormack claimed that both laws pose unconstitutional barriers to abortion. US District Judge B. Lynn Winmill <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/sns-rt-us-abortion-idahotre78n0k3-20110923,0,199947.story">issued a temporary order</a> [Reuters report] preventing the state from enforcing the 1972 law. However, Judge Winmill also found that McCormack lacked standing to seek an order blocking enforcement of the new "fetal pain" statute because she was no longer pregnant and could not show that she was harmed by the new law. McCormack's attorney stated that he would attempt to establish standing at a future hearing.

<p>Idaho's "fetal pain" statute, passed in April, makes it a felony to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks based on controversial science indicating a fetus may feel pain after 20 weeks of development. State legislatures across the country have been implementing measures to restrict abortions, and challenges to these laws are appearing in many states. In August, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-key-provisions-of-texas-abortion-law.php">blocked several provisions of a new Texas abortion law</a> [JURIST report] that places restrictions on the procedure and requires a doctor to show a sonogram to and play the sounds of the fetal heartbeat for a woman prior to performing an abortion. Earlier in August, the <a href="http://www.apltwo.ct.state.az.us/">Arizona Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-court-lifts-injunction-on-2009-abortion-law.php">ended a two-year injunction</a> [JURIST report] on portions of a law that restricted abortion practices, suggesting that the lower judge had applied "strict scrutiny" in error rather than an "undue burden" test. Also in August, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-challenges-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">filed a lawsuit challenging a Kansas law</a> [JURIST report] that prohibits insurance companies from including coverage for abortion in their comprehensive plans.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Private Andrew Holmes was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jiYR9BbVMVmtzce5DVRm5YaWqbAg?docId=CNG.73bb9264f716edd03273a457350cf9e0.c11">sentenced to seven years in prison</a> [AFP report] as part of a plea deal that he agreed to on Thursday. Holmes <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/second-us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to shooting the civilian, but pleaded not guilty to previous charges of premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Holmes also pleaded guilty to one count each of possessing a finger bone of the victim and using marijuana. As part of the deal, Holmes will receive 499 days of time served and will be dishonorably discharged from the US Army. Holmes is the third soldier to strike a plea deal of the five charged with murder as part of a plot contrived with fellow soldiers to kill Afghan civilians, which took place between January and May of last year in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. Holmes has alleged that his co-defendant, Specialist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morlock">Jeremy Morlock</a> [JURIST news archive], ordered soldiers to fire at villagers. Morlock <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-solider-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March to three counts of murder, as well as one count each of assault, conspiracy, obstructing justice and illegal drug use in exchange for a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison.

<p>Investigations into the 5th Stryker Brigade have led to additional charges for lesser crimes against seven other soldiers. In May, US Army prosecutors charged Staff Sgt. David Bram with <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-army-charges-sixth-soldier-in-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">solicitation to commit premeditated murder</a> [JURIST report], failure to report crimes including murder, planting evidence near the body of an Afghan national, unlawfully engaging in murder scenario conversations with subordinates and aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon in related to the January 2010 murder plot. Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers following a plea agreement that will allow him to remain in the military after serving a nine-month sentence and testifying against other soldiers accused of terrifying civilians. A military investigation revealed that soldiers from the brigade had been plotting since 2009 to kill unarmed Afghans and stage them to look like casualties of combat. The probe into 12 soldiers regarding the civilian deaths <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">began in May 2010</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The EPPK is comprised of 700 Spanish and French prisoners, of varying levels of leadership in the ETA. The group called for focus on achieving freedom through democratic means and said the ceasefire would be "the first step on the path to amnesty." Although supporting the new agreement, the EPPK criticized the government's treatment of them, stating that the "prison system was built to destroy our political and human identity." The Guernica agreement is the greatest recognition of a separate Basque state that the Spanish government has ever agreed to, as well as a recognition of repatriation and other rights for ETA prisoners. Despite the EPPK's statement, the Spanish government <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE78N1RF20110924">responded by calling for the ETA to disband</a> [Reuters report], although recognizing the prisoners' efforts as a significant step.

<p>The Spanish government continues to actively pursue charges against ETA. Last week, the Spanish National Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/spain-court-sentences-former-basque-separatist-leader-for-terrorism.php">sentenced a former Basque separatist to 10 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for terrorism and trying to resurrect a banned political wing of ETA. In March 2010, the court sentenced a former Basque separatist party leader to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-court-sentences-former-basque.php">two years in prison for promoting terrorism</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that week, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-judge-accuses-venezuela.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the Venezuelan government of aiding ETA in a plot to assassinate members of the Colombian government in Spain. In February 2010, the Interior Ministry of Spain <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/basque-separatist-leader-arrested-in.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that it took into custody the suspected ETA leader, along with two other people who are believed to be senior members of the group. Spanish Judge Fernando Grande-Marlaska <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-finds-eta-attempted-to-kill.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier that ETA had tried three times to assassinate former Spanish prime minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001 but had failed. In June 2009, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-spain-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Spain's ban of Basque political groups Batasuna and Herri Batasuna for their alleged ties to ETA.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That morning, confidante to Mubarak and his former defense minister, Field Marshal Tantawi testified against Mubarak in a closed-session, but left early and refused to be cross-examined by counsel for the victims. Due to the closed-session, <a href = "http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/egypt-s-military-ruler-testifies-in-mubarak-trial-1.386511">nothing has been revealed about the testimony</a> [AP report], nor how the lawyers' actions stem from it. Mubarak is on trial for murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">general abuse of power</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report] stemming from his response to pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year. Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial for corruption charges. Mubarak's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">began on August 3</a> [JURIST report] with Mubarak and his sons pleading not guilty to all charges. The trial will resume on October 30 if a higher court finds no merit in the lawyers' filings. If upheld, the filings could delay the trial indefinitely.

<p><a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/egypt-court-convicts-former-mubarak-regime-leader-in-corruption-case.php">Violence broke out in the Egyptian court</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week, when the court resumed for a third session. Outside the court, demonstrators tussled with police, with several injuries reported. Presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-resumes-live-tv-broadcasts-to-end.php">decided to end live TV broadcasts</a> [JURIST report] of subsequent proceedings amid protests from the families of victims and praise from several courtroom lawyers who opposed the broadcasts. In July, officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place in downtown Cairo. Also in July, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, so it would coincide with Mubarak's trial. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters. <a target="_blank" href="http://amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report] and more than 6,000 injured during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr2401eh/pdf/BILLS-112hr2401eh.pdf">Transparency in Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation Act 2011</a> [text, PDF] would require the formation of a committee, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, to perform "analyses of the cumulative and incremental impacts of certain rules and actions" of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website]. In requiring the committee to analyze the impact on the economy of decisions made by the EPA, the Act would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-passes-bill-to-block-broad-environmental-protection-agency-rules/2011/09/23/gIQAV1WorK_story.html">delay the implementation</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] of many EPA regulations, including one which attempts to limit the discharge of certain toxins into the air and another which would limit the emissions of power plants in states that have been found to cause significant pollution in their neighboring states. To become law, the legislation still needs to pass in the Senate and receive approval from US President Barak Obama.

<p>The possible effects to the economy of environmental regulations has made their passage and implementation difficult as of late. Earlier this month, Obama requested the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/obama-overturns-epa-smog-standards.php">withdrawal of national smog standards</a> [JURIST report] proposed by the EPA. The draft <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html">Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards</a> [materials] would have reduced the amount of smog emissions to between 0.060 and 0.070 parts per million (ppm) from the previous 0.075 ppm. The EPA estimates that these changes would help reduce the effects of climate change and improve public health, saving the US between $13 billion and $100 billion in health care costs. The stricter smog standards, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/epa-proposes-stricter-smog-regulations.php">proposed by the EPA in January 2010</a> [JURIST report], would have replaced the Bush administration's broader <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/ozonepollution/standards.html">2008 national smog regulations</a> [text], complying with scientific recommendations. In his statement, Obama recognized recent efforts to improve environmental protection, but emphasized the need to trim down regulations in light of the economic downturn. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ambassador Nawaf Salam of Lebanon, on behalf of the 15 Security Council member nations, advised Yemen officials to proceed with "an inclusive, orderly and Yemeni-led process of political transition" that adheres to an initiative supported by the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> [official website]. The member nations expressed their concern for the decline in economic and humanitarian stability in the country. The council also indicated that threats from al Qaeda in parts of Yemen have contributed to the country's "worsening security situation." The announcement comes in response to recent violence that has resulted in the <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119254238529145.html">deaths of at least 49 people</a> [Al Jazeera report] since Yemen <a target="_blank" href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%5C%22Ali+Abdullah+Saleh%5C%22">news archive</a>] returned from a three month absence on Friday.

<p>A delegation from the UN <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] released a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/YE/YemenAssessmentMissionReport.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] earlier this month announcing a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11364&amp;LangID=E">humanitarian crisis in Yemen</a> [press release] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-office-calls-for-immediate-intervention-in-yemen-humanitarian-crisis.php">requires immediate intervention</a> [JURIST report]. Rights groups have also criticized Yemen for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have persisted since February. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] in April urging the international community to pressure Yemeni authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">investigate protestor deaths</a> [JURIST report]. Just days earlier, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-yemen-to-halt-use-of-force-against-protesters.php">urged the Yemeni government</a> [JURIST report] to stop using force against peaceful protesters. The Yemeni Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">enacted several emergency measures</a> [JURIST report] in March at the request of Saleh in an effort to end anti-government protests. Saleh, who <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down in April</a> [JURIST report], and his party, the General People's Congress (GPC), had caused mounting political tensions due to attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand their political power. In December, the parliament stoked outrage among opposition parties and independents when it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipKDkB5w7UaeP0M9e8bZ1XdjZokQ?docId=CNG.9eab6633bebd069b5f0a3ec51e79b6e5.b51">amended the constitution</a> [AFP report] to eliminate provisions requiring that opposition parties be represented on the high election commission.

The letter follows earlier <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-urge-cameroon-to-decriminalize-same-sex-acts.php">requests to decriminalize</a> [JURIST report] the same-sex laws in accordance with <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/CCPR.C.CMR.CO.4.doc">recommendations</a> [report, DOC] issued by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> (UNHRC) [official website], which expressed concern that the laws impede the effectiveness of HIV and AIDS prevention programs.

<p>According to a 2009 AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR17/001/2009/en/126d20cd-de59-11dd-b660-fb1f16ee4622/afr170012009en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/dissent-violently-repressed-cameroon-20090129">abstract</a>], the Cameroon government participated in and encouraged <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-cameroon.php">unlawful executions, torture and other human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. The report alleges that such violations have been taking place for more than 10 years and may increase with the current global economic crisis and continued political unrest.

The request follows the Scottish Crown's recent <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/scotl [JURIST report] se-of-lockerbie-bomber.php">defense of its decision to release</a> [JURIST report] convicted Lockerbie bomber, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7728434.stm">Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi</a> [BBC profile] on humanitarian grounds due to his terminal prostate cancer diagnosis. Megrahi, convicted of murdering 270 people in 2001 after blowing up Pan Am Flight 103, was received as a "hero" upon returning to Libya from prison and <a href="http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre78p10a-us-libya-lockerbie/">still lives two years later</a> [Reuters report]. Convinced that Megrahi did <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44667192/ns/world_news-europe/">not act alone</a> [MSNBC article], prosecutors have also suggested investigating the possible involvement of former Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>].  The NTC has yet to respond to the Crown's request.  

<p>In August 2010, Scottish Labour Party officials called for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/scotland-lawmakers-call-for-release-of-lockerbie-bomber-medical-records.php">publication of all medical evidence related to the release</a> [JURIST report] of al-Megrahi. The demand came one year after al Megrahi was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/scotland-justice-secretary-orders.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from prison on compassionate grounds because doctors predicted he only had three months to live. Despite the publication of a report leading to the decision, the Labour party said that all medical opinions leading to the decision and the names of the doctors who authored them <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-10924910">should also be released</a> [BBC report]. Responding to criticism of his decision to release al Megrahi, Scottish Justice <a href="http://www.kennymacaskill.co.uk/">Secretary Kenny MacAskill</a> [official website] claimed he acted in good faith when authorizing the release, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/7936080/Lockerbie-bomber-decision-taken-in-good-faith.html">denying that there was an arrangement</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] for al Megrahi to drop his appeal in return for his release. Al Megrahi returned to his native Libya, where he is still living, and experts have suggested that he <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/COGRA/APWorldNews/Article_2011-08-20-EU-Britain-Lockerbie/id-fca99cf2898f4480b5cbb94e25d20d5b">could continue living for several more years</a> [AP report]. Al Megrahi's release was controversial, with both <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/COGRA/APWorldNews/Article_2011-08-20-EU-Britain-Lockerbie/id-fca99cf2898f4480b5cbb94e25d20d5b">US officials</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/scotland-parliament-votes-to-condemn.php">Scottish Parliament</a> [JURIST reports] condemning it.

According to anonymous officials, the Obama administration is considering the controversial move because they believe that the best place to try Ali Mussa Daqduq is a US military base. Daqduq was captured in Iraq in 2007, where he is currently being held. He is linked to a raid in Karbala, Iraq, which killed four American soldiers and is believed to have ties to Iran. If a US military tribunal hears the case, it will mark the first time a military commission has been held on US soil since <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. If no decision is made by the end of the year, Daqduq must be transferred to the custody of Iraqi officials according to a 2008 agreement between the US and Bagdad. Some have suggested that Daqduq be tried at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] as an alternative to a trial in the US. 

<p>The location of the trials of foreign terror suspects detained by the US has been a controversial issue. In July, the US brought Somali terror suspect Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame to the US to face a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/us-brings-somali-terror-suspect-to-new-york-for-civil-trial.php">civil trial in New York</a> [JURIST report], a decision that has sparked harsh criticism from members of Congress who argued that terror suspects should be held at Guantanamo Bay. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-orders-resumption-of-guantanamo-military-trials.php">ordered military commissions of detainees to resume</a> [JURIST report] in March after he initially suspended new charges at Guantanamo Bay shortly after taking office in 2009. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">consistently advocated</a> [JURIST report] that terror suspects should be tried in civilian courts despite finding little support from Congress. In April, Holder announced that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder, who <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">wanted the accused be tried before a federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report], referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] after Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">imposed a series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law imposes <a href="http://www.arabianbusiness.com/kuwait-gov-t-passes-anti-corruption-draft-law-422064.html">penalties of up to seven years in prison</a> [Reuters report] for a number of offenses related to money laundering and financial disclosure, including manipulation of public tenders and auctions, bribery, counterfeiting, forgery and graft. The passage of the draft law comes after the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website] released an <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2011/cr11268.pdf">assessment</a> [text, PDF] early this month concerning the country's anti-money laundering laws. The IMF criticized the existing system of laws for weakness in financial monitoring and outlined a series of recommendations including improvement of the countries suspicious transaction reporting requirements. The draft law goes next to <a href="http://www.da.gov.kw/eng/">Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah</a> [official website] and then parliament for approval. The passage of this anti-corruption law comes after a crowd of nearly 2,000 protested corruption in oil-exports in the countries capital last week.

<p>The move to change the law marks a departure from the country's previous response to protests and demonstrations in the region. In July, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-group-urges-kuwait-to-release-detention-for-Internet-message.php">urged Kuwait to immediately release</a> [JURIST report] two men being detained for posting messages on the Internet criticizing Middle East rulers. HRW reported that in June authorities detained and investigated <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/NasserAbuL">Nasser Abul</a> [Twitter feed, in Arabic] for threatening state security using Twitter and Lawrence al-Rashidi for posting a YouTube video criticizing Kuwait leader. His Tweets support the protestors demonstrations against Bahrain King <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa</a> [official profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Aimed at why the abuse occurred, the report, titled <a href="http://www.amnesty.ie/sites/default/files/INPLAINSIGHT%20(WEB_VERSION).pdf">In Plain Sight</a> [text, PDF], calls attention to those who "turned a blind eye" to the abuse and "people in positions of power" who "ignored their responsibility to act."  The report notes <a href="http://amnesty.ie/sites/default/files/Key%20Findings%20of%20In%20Plain%20Sight.doc">five major findings</a> [text, DOC]:<ul><li><strong>No clear lines of responsibility make true accountability impossible.</strong> In the case of residential institutions, it wasn't that the system didn't work but rather that there was no system.</li><li><strong>The law must protect and apply to all members of society equally.</strong>  Despite the severity of the crimes revealed in the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy (Dublin) and Cloyne Reports, which range from physical assault to rape, very few perpetrators have been convicted.</li><li><strong>Recognition of children's human rights must be strengthened.</strong> The sexual abuse in the diocesan reports, and the sexual, physical and emotional abuse, the living conditions, and the neglect described in the Ryan Report, can be categorized as torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment under human rights law.</li><li><strong>Public attitudes matter. Individual attitudes matter.</strong>  The end of deference to powerful institutions and the taking of personal responsibility on behalf of all members of society will initiate some of the changes that are necessary to prevent the occurrence of human rights abuses.</li><li><strong>The State must operate on behalf of the people, not on behalf of interest groups.</strong> While Taoiseach Enda Kenny's recent criticism of the Vatican suggests a less deferential attitude to the Catholic Church, transparency in the operations of all arms of the State is necessary to prevent interest groups from exerting undue influence.</li></ul>Colm O'Gorman, a survivor of clergy abuse and the current executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, called the abuse "perhaps the greatest human rights failure in the history of the state."

<p>The Vatican has come under intense pressure related to allegations of clergy child sex abuse and cover-ups by local bishops and Vatican officials. The release of <em>In Plain Sight</em> was <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/major-human-rights-report-affirms-sexual-abuse-clergy-%E2%80%9Ctorture%2C-inhuman-and-degrading-treatment%E2%80%9D">lauded</a> [press release] by the <a href="http://www.ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] which petitioned the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] prosecutor earlier this month to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-files-icc-complaint-against-vatican-over-clergy-abuse.php">investigate the Vatican for crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Calling <em>In Plain Sight</em> "another important step in the journey towards holding Vatican officials accountable", CCR pledged to "continue to gather information and evidence of additional crimes of rape and sexual violence and associated cover ups by the Catholic Church." In February 2010, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/vatican-releases-church-response.php">Vatican released church procedures</a> [JURIST report] for handling alleged cases of sexual abuse by priests, instructing, "Civil law concerning reporting of crimes to the appropriate authorities should always be followed." The "Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations" summarizes the procedures governing investigations by the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_pro_14071997_en.html">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a> (CDF) [official profile] into allegations of sex abuse by clergy members. The CDF guidelines provide for interim measures meant to ensure the safety of others during civil authorities' investigations or legal proceedings. The guidelines also outline a multi-tiered system of enforcement and appeals, including local bishops, the CDF, and the Pope himself. Since 2007, in the US alone, the Church has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=diocese+abuse">settled more than 500 cases</a> [JURIST news archive] of abuse for over $900 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/serbia-passes-restitution-law-as-part-of-eu-reform-but-heirs-say-bill-is-not-enough/2011/09/26/gIQA62m1yK_story.html">passed by an overwhelming majority</a> [AP report], is part of a larger property rights reform package that is key to Serbia's bid to join the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website], which is up for review next month. The law invites property owners or their heirs to register by 2014 in order to claim confiscated property or receive compensation which will be <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-26/serbian-lawmakers-approve-laws-needed-for-eu-membership-bid.html">funded by a 15-year bond</a> [Bloomberg report] not to exceed two billion euros.

<p>As part of its bid to join the EU, the Serbian government has increased efforts to combat organized crime and corruption as well as handing over alleged perpetrators of war crimes to the tribunal in The Hague. In July, Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10733">Goran Hadzic</a> [ICTY backgrounder], the last fugitive of the original 161 sought for war crimes by the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website].

Lawyers for the families of the anti-Mubarak protesters who were killed argued to the <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/category/organisation/cairo-appeals-court">Cairo Appeals Court</a> [Al Jazeera backgrounder] that Judge Ahmed Refaat was overseeing the case in an <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/09/26/Mubarak-trial-suspended-on-bias-claims/UPI-37271317048961/?spt=hts&or=3">arbitrary manner</a> [UPI Report]. Refaat suspended the trial until October 30, but if a new judge is put on the trial, it would start over. Mubarak is on trial for murder, attempted killing of protesters and other charges related to general <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011524132656755534.html">abuse of power</a> [Al Jazeera report] stemming from his response to pro-democracy <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this year. Mubarak's sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial for corruption charges. 

<p>Mubarak's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">began on August 3</a> [JURIST report] with Mubarak and his sons pleading not guilty to all charges. Rifaat decided last month to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-resumes-live-tv-broadcasts-to-end.php">end live TV broadcasts</a> [JURIST report] of subsequent proceedings amid protests from the families of victims and praise from several courtroom lawyers who opposed the broadcasts. Officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/-mubarak-trial-to-be-held-at-new-location-outside-cairo.php">chose a new location</a> for Mubarak's trial for security reasons after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mubarak-trial-to-be-held-in-cairo.php">reporting</a> [JURIST reports] that the trial would take place at a convention center in downtown Cairo. In July, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/trial-of-former-egypt-interior-minister-delayed.php">postponed the trial</a> [JURIST report] of former interior minister Habib el-Adly, who also faces murder charges in relation to the pro-democracy demonstrations, so it would coincide with Mubarak's trial. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt. Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">could face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report] and more than 6,000 injured during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposal now awaits approval by the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/Default.aspx?SID=1&ParentID=0&LangID=1">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website], which currently runs the nation.

<p>Earlier this month, NTC members assured world leaders that Libya will be a society of tolerance and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-interim-leaders-pledge-adherence-to-rule-of-law.php">respect for the rule of law</a> [JURIST report].

The pressure on Thailand comes after AI released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA39/002/2011/en/bb43fb2e-dd43-49d5-b05c-824ae3d27049/asa390022011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] detailing the deliberate attacks against civilians which they claim amount to war crimes. During the past eight years of insurgency aggression, nearly 5,000 civilians have been killed and thousands more injured in the four southern provinces of Thailand. The insurgency has been organizing the Malays, nearly all Muslim, against the predominantly Buddhist Thai state. The AI report is based on information gathered from interviews with witnesses and survivors, relatives and friends of victims. AI reported:<blockquote>Common Article 3 of the four Geneva Conventions clearly provides that all parties to an armed conflict must apply certain minimum standards in treating all "persons taking no active part in the hostilities". Targeting such persons for attack is prohibited at all times. The insurgents in southern Thailand, through widespread killings of persons taking no active part in hostilities, have violated Common Article 3. They have committed&#8212;and are continuing to commit&#8212;what amount to acts aimed at spreading terror among the civilian population, and which constitute war crimes.</blockquote>AI called on insurgent groups in Southern Thailand to immediately cease their attacks targeting civilians and publicly commit to preventing such attacks.

<p>Thailand has faced other criticism for its human rights record. In August, Thailand received criticism from UN Special Rapporteur on human trafficking <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/trafficking/CVJoyNgoziEzeilo.htm">Joy Ngozi Ezeilo</a> [official profile], who urged the government of Thailand to improve measures to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-thailand-to-combat-human-trafficking.php">combat human trafficking</a> [JURIST report], as well as protect the rights of migrant workers. The trafficking trade in Thailand is predominantly used for sexual and labor exploitation, with child trafficking especially rampant. In May, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Thailand's government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hrw-urges-thailand-to-investigate-criminal-offenses-committed-by-government-officials-protesters.php">investigate crimes</a> [JURIST report] allegedly committed by both government officials and protesters during 2010's violent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thailand+protests">political protests</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision could mean that the Supreme Court will hear the case during its 2011 term and that a ruling could come as early as June. The court is expected to agree to hear the case because there is a circuit split on the issue. The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">upheld the law</a> in June, and that ruling was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports] to the Supreme Court by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?568366954">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website]. JURIST Guest Columnist Steven Schwinn of the John Marshall Law School in Chicago recently argued that the Eleventh Circuit ignored the text, history and jurisprudence of the Constitution in its recent health care ruling, which will likely <a href="/forum/2011/09/steven-schwinn-eleventh-circuit-federalism.php">not be adopted by the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST op-ed] given recent rulings on congressional Commerce Clause authority.

<p>Other courts have also weighed in on the constitutionality of the individual mandate provision. Earlier this month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-rules-mandatory-health-insurance-provision-unconstitutional.php">individual mandate is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in September, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">dismissed two lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] challenging the mandate's constitutionality. In <span class="casename">Virginia v. Sebelius</span>, the court held that Virginia lacked standing to sue and vacated the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">judgment of the district court</a> [JURIST report], remanding the case with instructions to dismiss the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In <span class="casename">Liberty University v. Geithner</span>, the court ruled that the suit was filed prematurely, also vacating the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report], which had declared the act constitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The SHRC has called for an investigation into the identities of the remains, but, according to AI, their calls have been ignored.<blockquote>It is ... imperative that [members of the legislative assembly] call upon the government to ensure that sufficient resources are provided on an urgent basis for such identification by an independent body. The state government must also ensure that all past and current allegations of enforced disappearances are promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially investigated and that, where there is sufficient evidence, anyone suspected of responsibility for such crimes is prosecuted in proceedings which meet international fair trial standards.</blockquote>An additional 574 bodies were found, but those have been identified by local residents.

AI reported that India's <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,LEGISLATION,IND,,3ae6b52014,0.html">Public Safety Act</a> (PSA) [text] is being used to detain people despite the absence of sufficient evidence for a trial. Over the last decade, between 8,000 and 20,000 people have been detained through the PSA, including 322 between January and September 2010. The PSA only applies to Kashmir and Jammu, a state that <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/india-and-pakistan-resume-peace-talks.php">has been rife with unrest since it became part of India</a> [JURIST report] in the middle of the twentieth century. Kashmir and Jammu, which is officially part of India, has been disputed between Pakistan and India since 1947. Claims by both Pakistan and India to the territory have resulted in several conflicts in the region, particularly the Indo-Pakistan wars of 1947-1948 and 1965. In addition, there was a large show of military force by both nations in the region in 2002 that caused international alarm because both nations have nuclear weapons. India has sought to stifle unrest and a burgeoning separatist movement in the region by detaining human rights and political activists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision is seen by some as a <a href="http://www.golocalprov.com/news/tuition/">stepping stone</a> [GoLocalProv report] in the broader context of the contentious <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=immigration">immigration debate</a> [JURIST news archive] with proponents arguing that in-state tuition is an act of social justice in order to give all children access their "fundamental right" to an education, and opponents such as the <a href="http://theteaparty.net/?cdtrack_creative=e3d7dff6-fb5c-4fc2-9c70-eeb33aba9998&cdtrack_source=3db6b64a-7523-476f-83ab-f6d50ea69417&gclid=CNzVwpLcvasCFULf4Aodti7DxQ">Rhode Island Tea Party</a> [party website] arguing that tuition discounts encourage their parents' illegal actions and will significantly increase taxes. Children of illegal immigrants who attended school in Rhode Island for at least three years will pay the $9,824.00 tuition rate, as opposed to the out-of-state tuition rate of $25,912. The unanimous decision will take effect in 2012.  

<p>The Rhode Island decision is one of many immigration issues currently pending across the country. In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060611zor.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1029.htm">Martinez v. Regents of the University of California</a> [docket], thereby <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/the-us-supreme-court-official.php">rejecting a challenge to California's policy</a> [JURIST report] of granting in-state tuition for state colleges and universities to illegal immigrants who graduated from California high schools. Last year, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/05-19-Martinez-opinion-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/california-high-court-rules-illegal-immigrants-eligible-for-in-state-tuition.php">report</a>] that the state's policy did not conflict with federal law because a student's high school graduation, not his or her residency, formed the basis for granting in-state tuition. Most students who take advantage of this rule are <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/06/news/sc-dc-0607-court-tuition-20110607">enrolled in community colleges</a> [LAT report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Blagojevich was scheduled to be sentenced on October 6 after he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-convicted-on-corruption-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in June on multiple counts of corruption. US District Court Judge James Zagel gave no reason for the delay, but the date of sentencing was set to coincide with the start of the trial of Springfield power broker William Cellini. The Cellini case is the last major trial stemming from investigations into the former governor's administration. According to Blagojevich's attorney, Blagojevich has no objection to the delay, and it is likely he will be sentenced in mid-October or early November. Blagojevich can appeal his conviction to the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website].

<p>Blagojevich was previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] last year of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on 23 additional charges. The prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dropped some of the charges</a> [JURIST report] to simplify the case for retrial including charges for racketeering. Last September, lawyers for Blagojevich asked the judge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/blagojevich-asks-judge-to-override-false-statements-conviction.php">throw out the sole conviction</a> [JURIST report], stating that the government failed to meet its required burden of proof and that cross-examinations by the defense were <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/blagojevich-on-trial/2010/09/blagojevich-lawyers-seek-to-throw-out-conviction-cite-plethora-of-errors.html">plagued by "obstructionist" objections</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report], which the court continuously sustained. In January 2009, the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office. Blagojevich and his former chief of staff John Harris were initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Mary Scriven <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/index.cfm?action=viewRelease&emailAlertID=3948">heard arguments</a> [ACLU press release] Monday on both the constitutionality of the drug testing law and whether plaintiff, Luis Lebron, could represent a class. The judge granted the Florida Department of Children and Families a <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/09/26/2425529/federal-judge-hearing-arguments.html">two-week extension</a> [AP report] to challenge a motion on whether Lebron's lawsuit can represent all Florida welfare applicants. The lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/florida-aclu-challenges-mandatory-drug-screening-for-state-welfare-applicants.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month on behalf of a class led by Lebron, a 35-year-old Orlando resident, Navy veteran and full time University of Central Florida student who applied for temporary cash assistance to help support his four-year-old son. The <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> (ACLUFL) [advocacy website] filed the federal <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/pdfs/ACLUTANFComplaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/index.cfm?action=viewRelease&emailAlertID=3946">press release</a>] seeking to enjoin implementation of the drug testing law.

<p>In effect since July 1, the <a href="http://leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0400-0499/0414/Sections/0414.0652.html">new law</a> [Fla Stat 414.0652 text] was signed by <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] at the end of May and requires applicants for welfare benefits under the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/tanf/index.html">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families</a> (TANF) [official website] program to submit to and fund a urinalysis for substance screening. Individuals who pass receive reimbursement for the cost of the test, and those who fail lose their TANF benefits for one year. The ACLU complaint notes that the Supreme Court has held that suspicionless drug testing by the government is an unreasonable search that violates the Fourth Amendment, the only exceptions being for substantial public safety concerns and students in the public school system. TANF is a federal block grant program passed under 1996 welfare reform legislation aimed at turning welfare into a temporary assistance program. In June, the ACLUFL <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-aclu-challenges-mandatory-drug-screening-of-state-employees-applicants.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging Scott's executive order mandating state agencies to enact pre-employment drug screening for all prospective employees and provide for random drug testing of all current agency employees regardless of classification.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1018.htm">Filarsky v. Delia</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/09-26-Filarsky-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether a lawyer retained to work with government employees in conducting an internal affairs investigation is precluded from asserting qualified immunity solely because of his status as a "private" lawyer rather than a government employee. Firefighter Nicholas Delia brought suit against the city of Rialto, the Rialto Fire Department, several city officials and a private attorney, Steve Filarsky, for violating his constitutional rights during an internal affairs investigation. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/09-26-Filarsky-opinion-below.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Delia's rights were violated but that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity because the right was not clearly established. The Ninth Circuit also found that the private attorney was not entitled to qualified immunity.

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1211.htm">Vartelas v. Holder</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/96815600/Vartelas-Cert-Petition">cert. petition</a>], the court will determine whether <a href = "http://supreme.justia.com/us/374/449/case.html">Rosenberg v. Fleuti</a> [opinion text], should be applied to plaintiff Panagis Vartelas instead of current immigration law that repeals the law settled in <span class = "casename">Fleuti</span>. <span class = "casename">Rosenberg v. Fleuti</span> held that a permanent legal resident can make "innocent, casual, and brief" trips abroad without being denied reentry. But this interpreted law was changed by <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html">8 USC &#167; 1101(a)(13)(C)(v)</a> [text], which holds that a permanent resident can be denied reentry if he has committed a crime of "moral turpitude" in the past. Vartelas pleaded guilty to a crime before the law was ratified and then left the US briefly and was denied reentry. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17789396085984641115&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">held</a> [opinion text] that Vartelas was not entitled to immigration review and the law could be applied retroactively and supersedes the <span class = "casename">Fleuti</span> doctrine.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1399.htm">Roberts v. Sea-Land Services</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/96817125/Roberts-Cert-Petition">cert. petition</a>], the court will clarify when the period for compensation is under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_33_10_18.html">Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act</a> [text], which goes into effect after a worker is disabled on the job. The calculation for compensation is based on several factors, including the national average wage. Dana Roberts was disabled from a period between 2002 and 2005, but her claim was not adjudicated until 2007. She is arguing that the national average wage should be used from 2007, when the award was first decided, as opposed to 2002, when she was injured. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/11/10/08-70268.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Roberts misinterpreted the phrase "those newly awarded compensation during such period" and held that her compensation should be calculated based on the 2002 national average.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1472.htm">Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Taniguchi-Cert-Pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide if translating written documents is enough to be considered an "interpreter" under <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001920----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 1920</a> [text] for matters of compensation. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/09-15212.pdf">determined</a> [opinion, PDF] that translating documents is acting as an interpreter under the law.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1542.htm">Holder v. Gutierrez</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2010/2pet/7pet/2010-1542.pet.aa.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1543.htm">Holder v. Sawyers</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2010/2pet/7pet/2010-1543.pet.aa.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will be considering questions on illegal immigrants who reside with lawful immigrants. Essentially, both cases concern whether the alien children of legal residents can have their parents' years in the country imputed to them for the purposes of obtaining citizenship. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gut_opbelow.pdf">Gutierrez</a> and in <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sawyers_opbelow.pdf">Sawyers</a> [opinions, PDF] that the Board of Immigration must review their deportation orders and consider their parents' years in lawful residence as well as if, as minors, they were residing with their legal immigrant parents.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-9995.htm">Wood v. Milyard</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/96820196/wood_cerpet">cert. petition</a>], the court will determine if the prosecution raising a statute of limitations argument in response to plaintiff's appeal is an error. Further, specific to this case, if the state's assurance to the plaintiff that they would not raise a statute of limitations argument is enough to bind them to not be able to raise it later in proceedings. The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <A href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12839813996569676862&q=%22patrick+wood%22&hl=en&as_sdt=4,74,81,91,98,101,106,120,137,144,154,161,164,295,296,297,358,359,360,384">ruling</a> [opinion text] barred Patrick Wood's petition for writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> based on its timeliness.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-139.htm">US v. Home Concrete &#38; Supply</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/09-26-Concrete-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will look at what can activate an "extended six-year assessment" period for taxes. The case questions if an understatement of gross income attributable to an overstatement of property assets can trigger this period. A Department of Treasury regulation holds that it does, and the court will also examine if this regulation should have judicial deference. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/09-26-Concrete-opinion-below.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the assessment should not have been initiated, and that the Department of Treasury's regulation was not holding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tymoshenko is on trial on charges of abuse of power and corruption, with the prosecution arguing that she orchestrated a deal where Ukraine's national gas company would pay Russia excessively high prices for gas. Tymoshenko's team repeated that the charges and potential sentence are <A href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/7a877aca">unjustifiable</a> [press release]. Recently, the <a href = "http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] has <A href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/17/ukraine-tymoshenko-premier-idUSL5E7KH0CJ20110917">threatened to cancel free trade and association agreements</a> [Reuters report] with the Ukraine if the trial of Tymoshenko is not conducted reasonably, including blocking the Ukraine from joining the EU. In response, Tymoshenko <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/99vo5vvv">asked the EU to continue contracting with the Ukraine</a> [press release] despite her trial: "I asked that they not make the decision to sign an association agreement dependent on what is happening now with my personal fate because the signing of an association agreement is a historical event, a historical step that must be taken, not to mark Yanukovych, but to once and for all cut off our path to the past."

<p>Last month, former Ukrainian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4035789.stm">Viktor Yushchenko</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yushchenko">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-president-testifies-against-former-ally-tymoshenko.php">testified against</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko, his former prime minister. That same month, the Kiev Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-appeals-court-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">refused</a> Tymoshenko's appeal of her <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-arrested.php">detention for contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in August, Judge Rodoin Kireyev <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/ukraine-judge-refuses-to-release-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] from Tymoshenko to release her from prison. In July, the <a href="http://www.sbu.gov.ua/">Security Service of Ukrain</a>e (SBU) [official website, in Ukrainian] announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-energy-company-under-investigation.php">launching a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), an energy company at one time headed by Tymoshenko. In June, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argued that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Minister for Defence, <a href="http://www.minister.defence.gov.au/category/smith/">Stephen Smith</a> [official website] cited the "long and proud history" of women serving in the ADF as one of the reasons underlying the removal of the gender restrictions, which had prevented women from working in positions as Mine Clearance Divers and Ground Defence Officers, among others. A woman's suitability for a role will now be determined based on her ability to perform the duties required by the position rather than her gender. The policy should be completely implemented within five years. The <a href="http://www.ada.asn.au/media.htm">Australian Defence Association</a> [official website], a security think-tank, has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/27/australian-military-women-frontline-roles?newsfeed=true">voiced concerns</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] regarding the involvement of women in combat roles, fearing that due to the bio-mechanical differences between men and women, the latter would experience a disproportionately higher rate of causalities.

<p>While a high number of women serve in the armed forces around the world, Australia is only the fourth country to allow them to serve on the front-lines without restrictions. Last January, a US Military panel recommended in its latest report that <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/military-commission-recommends-allowing-women-to-serve-in-direct-military-combat.php">women should be allowed to serve on the front lines of combat</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://mldc.whs.mil/">Military Leadership Diversity Commission</a> (MLDC) [official website], composed of retired and current military leaders, said that women, who under current defense policy are prohibited from serving in direct line-of-fire combat, should be permitted to serve in combat and that integration of women into combat forces would have no ill effects. The commission recommended a "time-phased" approach to the implementation of new combat policies that would create additional career options for women that include "direct ground combat." The report addressed common concerns among military officials that inclusion of women in combat forces would present problems with unit cohesion and that the current policy is effective due to current warfare techniques. The commission's conclusion is that in Iraq and Afghanistan women have already been exposed to combat-related activities, with no negative effects, and that the current policy is discriminatory to women.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" vspace="4" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" /></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" width="5" border="0" height="1" /></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/09/26/order%20re%20temp%20stay.pdf">extended a hold</a> [order, PDF] on the release of the video recordings of last year's trial on the constitutionality of California's same-sex marriage ban. In response to an emergency motion by proponents of the ban, the court granted a stay of US District Court Chief Judge James Ware's September 19th <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-orders-release-of-same-sex-marriage-video.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/09/20/District_court_order.pdf">order</a>] that granted the unsealing of the Proposition 8 trial video recordings. The proponents do not contest Judge Vaughn Walker's original order placing the video recordings in the official trial record, only the unsealing of that record. As such, Ware rested his ruling solely on the common law right to inspect and copy public records and documents, which includes the trial record, of which the video recordings are an official part. The proponents claim that under US Supreme Court precedent, Local Rule 77-3 would have altogether prevented Walker from originally creating the recordings, but for his unequivocal representation at the time that they would not be publicly broadcast outside the courthouse. The proponents further claim that the Rule would have barred the placement of the video recordings in the official record but for Walker's sealing order. Common law rules are displaced by statute and other positive legislative and administrative enactments, and therefore, the proponents argue, now that the recordings exist and the trial record is sealed, Rule 77-3 abrogates the common law rationale for unsealing that portion of the trial record. Alternatively, the proponents claim that the official record of the trial proceedings is constituted in whole by court reporter's transcript, not the video recordings, and so the common law right of access cited by Judge Ware in his unsealing order does not apply.

<p>At its beginning, Walker ordered the trial recorded exclusively for use in his chambers, permissible under Rule 77-3. The US Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-blocks-youtube-broadcast.php">prevented the broadcast of the trial</a> [JURIST report] after Judge Walker attempted to put the trial in a pilot program that would have broadcasted the proceedings to other courthouses. The order continued a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks.php">temporary stay</a> ordered by the Supreme Court the same day the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-federal-court-begins.php">trial began</a> [JURIST reports]. Supporters of Proposition 8 had objected to the controversial decision to broadcast the trial proceedings, claiming it would result in witness intimidation. The YouTube broadcast of the case, <a href="https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/">Perry v. Schwarzenegger</a> [case materials], was to be allowed under the experimental program approved by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] that allows cameras in civil, non-jury cases. Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by California voters in November 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The five judges composing the Appeals Chamber will decide whether the Trial Chamber committed a number of  errors of law and fact, as alleged by Ntawukulilyayo, who seeks a reversal of his conviction, an acquittal and immediate release or, in the alternative, a reduction of his sentence. Ntawukulilyayo was <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=8&mnid=2">indicted</a> [case materials] in 2005 on charges of genocide, complicity in genocide and public incitement to commit genocide for falsely promising protection to ethnic minority Tutsi refugees, all of which occurred during the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide"> news archive</a>]. In August 2010, the Trial Chamber found him guilty of genocide, and he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/former-rwanda-ntawukulilyayo-official-sentenced-to-25-years-for-1994-genocide.php">sentenced to 25 years in prison</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The ITCR continues to prosecute individuals for their involvement in the 1994 genocide. In June, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-6-including-first-woman.php">convicted and sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six individuals, including the first female to be charged with genocide and crimes against humanity. The six were charged with conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity including extermination, murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The court also charged Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, former Minister of Women's Development and first female genocide criminal, and her son Arsene Shalom Ntahobali with rape. The court determined that the systematic killing of thousands of ethnic Tutsi authorized and facilitated by the individuals during the genocide amounted to crimes against humanity. Nyiramasuhuko was sentenced to life in prison based on the finding that she was guilty of seven of the 11 charges against her. The varying sentences for the other individuals range from 25 years in prison to life sentences. The six, who were arrested 16 years ago, will receive credit for time served. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ntabakuze appealed his December 2008 conviction, in which the Trial Chamber <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/608.html">sentenced him to life imprisonment</a> [judgment, PDF]. Before a panel of five judges, Ntabakuze's lawyer <a href="http://www.hirondellenews.com/content/view/14812/1209/">requested an acquittal of the conviction</a> [HNA report] because the prosecution lacked sufficient evidence and failed to provide adequate notice of the charges. The prosecution said that the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case%5CEnglish%5CBagosora%5Cdecisions%5C061006c.pdf">indictment</a> [text, PDF] provided Ntabakuze with adequate notice to defend his case. The Trial Chamber charged and convicted Ntabakuze in a case known as "Military I" that joined two other former army officers, <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/084.html">Theoneste Bagosora</a> and <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/108.html">Anatole Nsengiyumva</a> [HJP profiles]. The ICTR separated Ntabakuze's case from his co-defendants' after his lawyer failed to attend schedule oral arguments before the Appeals Chamber in March. 

<p>The former head of Ntabakuze's defense, US lawyer and JURIST <a href="/forum/">Forum</a> [website] contributor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Peter+Erlinder">Peter Erlinder</a> [JURIST news archive], grabbed international attention earlier this year before the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ictr-removes-us-defense-lawyer-from-tribunal-work.php">ICTR removed him from the case</a> [JURIST report] in April for failing to appear at Ntabakuze's scheduled oral arguments. Erlinder claimed that he did not travel to the tribunal because his life was in danger and that he was on a reported hit list consisting of the opponents of Rwandan <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com/">President Paul Kagame</a> [official website]. In October 2010, Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga announced that Erlinder would be summoned to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-lawyer-to-face-charges-of-genocide-denial-in-rwanda.php">face charges of genocide denial</a> [JURIST report] in Rwanda, after Erlinder said that it was incorrect to place the blame for the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda%20genocide">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive] on one side. Erlinder <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/lawyer-freed-from-rwanda-returns-to-us.php">returned to the US in June 2010</a> after spending 21 days in a Rwandan prison following his <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawyer-arrested-in-rwanda-for-genocide-denial.php">arrest</a> [JURIST reports] on genocide denial charges. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Nonprofit organization <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/">Justice Watch</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/files/documents/2011/jw-v-dod-complaint-05132011.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] against the Obama administration in May, claiming that the government violated the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] by refusing to release photographs of bin Laden's body. Obama announced in May that the US government would not release the photographs and now defends the decision, arguing in its motion that publicizing the graphic images would <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-tells-court-bin-laden-photos-stay-secret-14620535">encourage violence against Americans</a> [AP report] and would jeopardize classified military information. Other scholars agree that the photographs <a href="/forum/2011/05/burial-at-sea-the-end-of-osama-bin-laden.php">should remain undisclosed</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Judicial Watch urged the administration to comply with the FOIA and promote transparency. 

<p>As founder and leader of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive], Bin Laden represents the highest profile terror target captured or killed by the US. Bin Laden was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] in early May by American military forces in Pakistan. Critics have questioned the legality of the targeted killing, arguing that such an action <a href="/forum/2011/05/curtis-doebbler-illegal-killing-obl.php">violates international law</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Bin Laden had <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/usama-bin-laden/view">topped the US list of Most Wanted Terrorists</a> [FBI backgrounder] and is believed to have approved or helped plan many notorious terror attacks including those against New York and Washington DC on <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11, 2001</a>, the 2000 bombing of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22uss+cole%22">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archives], <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania</a> [PBS backgrounder] in 1998 and the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.kywd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Kentucky</a> [official website] ruled Tuesday that an Iraqi national can stand trial in US civilian court for terrorism-related crimes. Chief Judge Thomas Russell, in an 11-page opinion, <a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110927/NEWS01/309270037/Iraqi-can-tried-civilian-court-Judge-issues-ruling-bombing-case?odyssey=nav|head">rejected</a> [<em>Courier-Journal</em> report] arguments made by Waad Ramadan Alwan that, under the Geneva Convention, he could only be prosecuted in Iraq. Alwan is an Iraqi citizen who allegedly carried out numerous improvised explosive device (IED) attacks against US troops in Iraq, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/May/11-nsd-701.html">according to the Department of Justice</a> [press release text]. Russell determined that the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5">Geneva Civilian Convention</a> [treaty text] does not bar concurrent jurisdiction by foreign and US courts and that, although Alwan claimed that the federal law under which he was charged was intended only to protect diplomatic personnel overseas, in fact the statute may be extended to criminalize insurgent and terrorist activities in other countries even though those same acts may be punishable in Iraqi courts as well. Alwan is charged with conspiracy to kill US nationals abroad, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) against US nationals abroad, distributing information on the manufacture and use of IEDs, attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al-Qaeda in Iraq and conspiracy to transfer, possess and export Stinger missiles. Alwan and another former Iraq resident, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, both of whom currently reside in Bowling Green, were charged there in May in a 23-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury. Each faces a potential sentence of life in prison if convicted of all the charges.

<p>Alwan is one of only a handful of <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ag-holder-defends-prosecuting-terror-suspects-in-civilian-courts.php">foreign nationals prosecuted in the US for alleged terrorism offenses</a> [JURIST report] in a US-occupied territory such as Iraq or Afghanistan during wartime. Senate Minority Leader <a href="http://mcconnell.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=Home">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) [official website] and others have also objected to holding the trials of Alwan and Hammadi in federal court, but they have cited security concerns and said they should be prosecuted before a military tribunal at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. McConnell and others also have said the defendants do not deserve the full protection of the Bill of Rights accorded to civilian defendants. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">consistently advocated</a> [JURIST report] that terror suspects should be tried in civilian courts, though has not found support from Congress. In April, Holder announced that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder, who wanted the accused be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report], referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The petitions for <em>certiorari</em> filed by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/healthcare/docs/hhs-v-florida-petition-certiorari.pdf">DOJ</a> and <a href="http://myfloridalegal.com/webfiles.nsf/WF/JDAS-8M5KCL/$file/HC_StatesPetitiontoUSSupremeCt.pdf">states</a> [petitions, PDF] seek review of a decision handed down by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] last month. The Eleventh Circuit found the PPACA individual health care mandate <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but upheld the remainder of the law without the mandate. The states asked the court to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's decision regarding the individual mandate requirement. The states also sought review of the PPACA as a whole, arguing that the act must fail because the individual mandate was "the centerpiece" of the entire piece of legislation. The DOJ asked the court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit's decision, arguing that it was "fundamentally flawed" and that Congress has "broad deference" to enact laws regarding economic and tax policies. In a <a href="http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1606">statement</a> [text], the DOJ expressed confidence that the Court would find the law constitutional and compared the PPACA lawsuits to other historical legislative challenges:<blockquote>Throughout history, there have been similar challenges to other landmark legislation such as the Social Security Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act, and all of those challenges failed. We believe the challenges to [PPACA]&#8212;like the one in the Eleventh Circuit&#8212;will also ultimately fail and that the Supreme Court will uphold the law.</blockquote>
Additionally, the Obama Administration filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/US-opp-brief-Thomas-More-9-28-11.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] in opposition to a petition for <em>certiorari</em> <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/TMLC-petitions-supreme-court-over-sixth-circuit-ruling-in-favor-of-PPACA.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">Thomas More Law Center v. Obama</span> in July, which sought review of a decision by the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] that found the individual mandate provision <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-finds-health-care-reform-law%27s-individual-mandate-constitutional.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The administration asked the court to either delay review of that decision or to consolidate the two cases.

<p>Lawsuits involving the constitutionality of the PPACA have led to split decisions in federal courts across the country. Earlier this month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] found the individual mandate provision <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-judge-rules-mandatory-health-insurance-provision-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also this month, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">dismissed two lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] challenging the constitutionality of the PPACA. In <span class="casename">Virginia v. Sebelius</span>, the court held that Virginia lacked standing to sue and vacated the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-allows-virginia-health-care-suit-to-proceed.php">judgment of the district court</a> [JURIST report], remanding the case with instructions to dismiss the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In <span class="casename">Liberty University v. Geithner</span>, the court ruled that the suit was filed prematurely, also vacating the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report], which had declared the act constitutional. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-health-care-suit-for-lack-of-standing.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by a physician organization for lack of standing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The woman, known as "M," contracted viral encephalitis in February 2003, fell into a coma and subsequently emerged in what was later determined to be a "minimally conscious," non-vegetative state. The family's request to discontinue treatment was a case of first impression in the UK, as the courts previously had only ruled on cases involving patients in vegetative states. After hearing testimony from the family and M's medical staff, Justice Baker determined that the situation failed to meet the requirements under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">Mental Capacity Act</a> [materials]. Specifically, M did not make any formal advance decision regarding the withdrawal of treatment if she were to be in her existing state. Baker determined that "the importance of preserving life [was] the decisive factor" in the case, but also acknowledged that the family would likely be disappointed in the outcome:<blockquote>I realise that this decision will be a severe disappointment to members of M's family who have endured years of anguish during which they have demonstrated their deep devotion to M. ... I urge everyone concerned with M&#8212;doctors, care staff, and her family&#8212;to work together to agree on a revised care plan which gives her an opportunity of more positive experiences.</blockquote>Baker also determined that M's "Do Not Resuscitate" order should be continued but held that other treatment decisions should be left to medical and care staff.

<p>The right to die has been a highly contentious issue around the world.  Last month, the <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/supreme_court/">Supreme Court of British Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/canada-court-rejects-right-to-die-claim-for-lack-of-standing.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a right to die suit for lack of standing. The suit challenged the constitutionality of a provision of <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-103.html#h-79">section 241(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada</a> [text], which criminalizes assisted suicide. Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/india-high-court-rules-passive-euthanasia-permitted-under-certain-circumstances.php">rejected a petition for mercy killing</a> [JURIST report] but ruled that passive euthanasia was permissible under certain circumstances. The German <a href="http://www.bundesgerichtshof.de/cln_136/DE/Home/home_node.html">Federal Court of Justice</a> [official website, in German] ruled in October that <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php">removing a patient from life support is not a criminal offense</a> [JURIST report] if the terminal individual had previously given consent. The year before, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.wa.gov.au/">Supreme Court of Western Australia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/australia-court-allows-quadriplegic.php">upheld the right to die</a> [JURIST report] in a case involving a quadriplegic who asked to be removed from food and hydration services. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendment effectively <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/09/29/business-financial-impact-lt-mexico-abortion_8707379.html">bans abortions</a> [AP report] in Mexico's northern Baja California state. Seven of 11 justices on the court, who argued that the issue was a federal and not state issue, voted to overturn the amendment, but failed to meet the requisite eight votes to overturn the law on constitutional grounds. Sixteen Mexican states have adopted similar amendments, though most states permit abortion in limited circumstances. <a href="http://www.mexicocity.gob.mx/">Mexico City</a> [official website, in Spanish] legislators voted <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/mexico-city-legislators-vote-to.php">legalize abortion within the city</a> [JURIST report] in April 2007. 

<p>Abortion is generally illegal throughout the heavily Roman Catholic country, with exceptions only for cases of rape. Mexico City previously loosened the country's restriction to allow abortions when the health of the mother was in danger. Conservatives in the country, including <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, in Spanish] and his <a href="http://www.pan.org.mx/">National Action Party</a> (PAN) [party website, in Spanish] are strongly opposed to any relaxation of abortion law. Others say that the current laws endanger poor women who, unlike wealthier Mexicans, cannot afford to travel to the US for the surgery and so must resort to unsafe back-alley abortions. In 2006, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] conducted an extensive <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2006/mexico0306/">study of abortion availability for rape victims in Mexico</a> [study text], finding that those seeking legal abortions often are intimidated with insults and threats of legal retaliation by both prosecutors and health workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 11-member commission, <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/COGRA/APWorldNews/Article_2011-09-28-AF-Ivory-Coast-Reconciliation-Commission/id-53907526cace4f0481aa0b08532f135f">modeled on similar efforts</a> [AP report] taken by South Africa during the post-apartheid era, is composed of Ivory Coast religious leaders and other dignitaries and is headed by former prime minister Charles Konan Banny. Former Ivory Coast president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured and forced from office</a> [JURIST report] after refusing to leave despite losing last November's election to now <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile], which resulted in months of fighting between Ouattara's and Gbagbo's forces. More than 3,000 people were killed from December to April following the election. The commission is likely to hear complaints from the families of people killed by Gbagbo's military. Rights groups are insisting that the government hear cases from families of those killed by Ouattara forces as well.

<p>In August, Ouattara <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ivory-coast-sets-up-commission-to-investigate-post-election-violence.php">set up a commission of inquiry</a> [JURIST report] to investigate crimes and human rights violations that took place during the violence.

Earlier that month, an official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of ousted leader Gbagbo. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the Republican Force of Ivory Coast killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. The <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] also reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chief Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn, in a 115-page memorandum <a href="http://www.cbs42.com/media/lib/124/8/f/e/8fe8b6cd-14e0-4e99-a282-e315acdeb483/Memorandum_Opinion.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF], ruled that the federal government's challenge to the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011rs/bills/hb56.htm">Beason-Hammon Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act</a> [HB 56 text] had <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9869865">not met the requirements for a preliminary injunction</a> [AP report] on a majority of the act's provisions. Blackburn did enjoin enactment of certain specifications, but included only the four sections that would 1) make it a crime for an illegal immigrant to solicit work, 2) make it a crime to transport or harbor an illegal immigrant, 3) allow discrimination lawsuits against companies that dismiss legal workers while hiring illegal immigrants and 4) forbid businesses from taking tax deductions for wages paid to workers who are in the country illegally. In her evaluation of the requirements for judicial injunction of a legislative act, the judge the concluded:<blockquote>that there is a substantial likelihood that the United States will succeed on the merits of its claim that Sections 11(a), 13, 16, and 17 of H.B. 56 are preempted by federal law. The court further finds that the United States will suffer irreparable harm if these sections of H.B. 56 are not enjoined, the balance of equities favors the entry of an injunction, and its entry would not be adverse to the public interest. Therefore, the Motion for Preliminary Injunction will be granted as to these sections.</blockquote>Among the portions of the law that escaped the preliminary injunction are provisions that require immigration status checks of public school students and of suspects pulled over by police, allow police to hold suspected illegal immigrants without bond, bar state courts from enforcing contracts involving illegal immigrants, make it a felony for an illegal immigrant to do business with the state and make it a misdemeanor for an illegal resident not to have immigration papers. State decisions on whether to begin enforcing these provisions have <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-immigration-alabamatre78s04a-20110928,0,1135972.story">not yet been announced</a> [Reuters report], but last month's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-alabama-immigration-law.php">temporary injunction on the whole act</a> [JURIST report] is set to expire at the end of this month. Republican <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] said he would fight to get the full law upheld and the state's attorney general said officials were weighing whether to appeal immediately or wait until the judge issues her final decision.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], joined by several rights groups, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-court-hears-arguments-on-alabama-immigration-law.php">appeared before the court last month</a> [JURIST report] to make arguments against the law's enactment, at which point Blackburn issued the temporary injunction to forestall enactment of the challenged provisions while she evaluated their contention with federal statute. Religious groups and representatives of several rights groups including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC), the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites] have stated that the Alabama law is the most extreme of the recent state anti-immigration laws influenced by controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=SB+1070">Arizona SB 1070</a> [JURIST news archive]. Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/alabama-lawmakers-defend-immigration-law.php">lawmakers have defended</a> the legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST reports] in June. Since that time, 16 countries <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/16-countries-file-briefs-against-alabama-immigration-law.php">filed briefs</a> [JURIST report] in the Alabama district court against the controversial law, arguing that it provides unfair treatment to citizens of those countries currently residing in Alabama and sanctions discriminatory treatment based on ethnicity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontguantanamosign.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] Wednesday officially referred charges against a high-profile <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee who allegedly planned the 2000 attack on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22USS+Cole%22">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archive] that left 17 sailors dead and 37 others injured. Saudi-born former millionaire <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive] will <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14821">stand trial before a military tribunal</a> [DOD press release] at Guantanamo on nine terrorism, conspiracy and murder <a href="http://www.mc.mil/CASES/MilitaryCommissions.aspx">charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF]. Specifically al-Nashiri will be charged with orchestrating the attack on the Cole, during which two suicide bombers rammed an explosives-laden boat into the guided missile destroyer, blowing a vast hole into its side. The charges also allege that al-Nashiri was in charge of planning and preparation for an attempted attack in the same year on USS The Sullivans as it refueled in the Port of Aden, and for an attack on the French civilian oil tanker MV Limburg in the same port in 2002, which resulted in the death of one crewmember and the release of approximately 90,000 barrels of oil into the gulf. A "referral of charges" by the DOD Military Commissions unit is the mechanism that officially begins the process that leads to the appointment of a military officer as trial judge, who is then required to conduct an arraignment within 30 days of the referral. al-Nashiri's case has been referred for trial as a capital case, meaning he could face the death penalty if convicted. In June the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/default_en.htm">European Parliament</a> (EP) [official website] urged the US <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eu-lawmakers-urge-us-not-to-seek-death-penalty-in-uss-cole-trial.php">not to seek the death penalty</a>  [JURIST report] in the case.

<p>Complicating his prosecution is the controversial history of al-Nashiri's detention. Former <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] agents <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,717166,00.html">confirmed</a> [Spiegel report] in 2010 the existence of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+secret+prisons">secret CIA black site</a> [JURIST news archive] in Poland, where al-Nashiri was allegedly waterboarded and subjected to mock executions. According to one agent, al-Nashiri was stripped naked and hooded before a gun and a drill were held close to his head. The allegations led the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">launch an abuse investigation</a> [JURIST report] in September 2010. Section 948r of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF] prohibits the use in military courts of evidence obtained through "torture or cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment," a provision that could implicate potential limitations on the prosecutors' ability to use certain evidence if it can be established that al-Nashiri was subjected to such treatment in Poland or at Gitmo. Former Polish prime minister Leszek Miller <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-ex-pm-denies-knowledge-of-cia-secret-prison.php">denied any knowledge of such a facility</a> [JURIST report]. Most recently, Polish prosecutors, who <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php">began investigating</a> the potential existence of the Polish CIA prison in 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/poland-prosecutors-ask-us-to-question-guantanamo-detainees-over-secret-cia-prison.php">asked US officials</a> [JURIST reports] to question al-Nashiri and fellow detainee Abu Zubaydah about the existence of the facility, saying their testimony was essential to establishing its existence. Relatedly, in 2007 a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-rules-sudan-liable-in-uss.php">ruled that Sudan was liable</a> [JURIST report] in a civil suit for government actions that "induced" the USS Cole bombing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Habyarimana has been accused of helping to plan the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1288230.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder] between Hutus and Tutsis in which more than 800,000 people, primarily Tutsis, were killed in the span of 100 days. After her husband's assassination, which led to an escalation of violence that sparked the genocide, Habyarimana was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8545120.stm">transported from Rwanda by the French military</a> [BBC report] and has since been living outside Paris, although she was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rwanda-ex-presidents-widow-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] briefly in March 2010 by French police complying with an international arrest warrant issued by the <a href="http://www.gov.rw/">Rwandan government</a> [official website]. Rwanda's chief prosecutor Martin Ngoga said that Rwanda has never extradited a suspect from France and that the court's decision was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gvdAbU1RFpTVMXfKvG28JgkGZ10Q?docId=CNG.a87d8cacedbd4d81d06c90bfe61572dd.831">not based on the merit of the accusations</a> [AFP report] against Habyarimana. Ngoga also said that Rwandan officials would accept the option of Habyarimana <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14763&article=45681">facing trial in France</a> [<em>New Times</em> report]. 

<p>Individuals accused of participating in the Rwandan genocide continue to face trial, both in Rwandan courts and at the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website]. Earlier this week, the Appeals Chamber for the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-hears-appeal-of-ex-army-officer.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case of <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/107.html">Aloys Ntabakuze</a> [HJP profile], a former Rwandan army officer convicted of genocide and related crimes.The Trial Chamber of the ICTR charged and <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/608.html">convicted</a> [judgment, PDF] Ntabakuze in a case known as "Military I" that joined two other former army officers. The same day, the ICTR also <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-hears-appeal-of-former-official.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the appeal of Dominique Ntawukulilyayo, the former Sub-Prefect of the southern region of Gisagara. Ntawukulilyayo was <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=8&mnid=2">indicted</a> [case materials] in 2005 on charges of genocide, complicity in genocide and public incitement to commit genocide for falsely promising protection to ethnic minority Tutsi refugees, all of which occurred during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In June, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ictr-transfers-case-of-former-pastor-to-rwanda-court.php">transferred the case</a> [JURIST report] of former Rwandan pastor <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/498.html">Jean-Bosco Uwinkindi</a> [Hague Justice profile] to Rwanda to be tried in the Rwandan national court system. Last year, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-transfers-25-cases-to-rwandan-jurisdiction.php">transferred the cases of 25 suspects</a> [JURIST report], who had been investigated but not yet indicted by the ICTR and who were believed to be in hiding abroad, to Rwandan authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcambodiaflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia <a href="http://www.law.leeds.ac.uk/about/staff/subedi/">Surya Subedi</a> [official profile] on Wednesday urged the Cambodian government to review a proposed law that would hinder non-governmental organization (NGO) efforts in the country. The proposed Law on Associations and Non-Governmental Organisations (LANGO) would force potential NGOs to meet strict eligibility requirements and to complete a government registration. When presenting his <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/18session/A-HRC-18-46_en.pdf">annual report</a> [text, PDF] on the situation of human rights in Cambodia to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website], Subedi said that, while Cambodia has the sovereign right to pass regulatory laws, LANGO's unnecessary registration requirements would prevent NGOs from fully contributing to long-term progress in the country. Last month, 130 NGOs working in Cambodia <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/Joint%20Statement%20on%20LANGO%20(English)_0.pdf">publicly opposed the proposed law</a> [statement, PDF], saying that the law would hurt the vital role that civil society organizations play in the continued development of the country. The Cambodian <a href="http://www.interior.gov.kh/en">Interior Ministry</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.voanews.com/khmer-english/news/human-rights/UN-Rights-Envoy-Cautions-Against-NGO-Law-130795483.html">agreed to review</a> [VOA report] at least one draft of the law before sending it to the <a href="http://www.pressocm.gov.kh/alpha/index.php?lang=2">Council of Ministers</a> [official website] for approval.

<p>Subedi also reported that human rights in Cambodia are improving. As part of the mission to promote human rights, the UN-backed <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] continues to try suspects accused of genocide and related crimes committed under the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge regime</a> [BBC backgrounder] during its reign in Cambodia from 1975-1979.

A week earlier, the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-concludes-fitness-hearing-for-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">concluded three days of hearings</a> [JURIST report] aimed at determining whether two of the four Khmer Rouge leaders were fit enough to stand trial on accusations of genocide and other war crimes. The four leaders include <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/Case_Info_Sheet_-_Nuon_Chea_%5BEN%5D_FINAL_25_May_2011.pdf">Nuon Chea</a>, who was Pol Pot's second-in-command and the group's chief ideologist, former head of state <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/Case%20Info%20Sheet%20-%20Khieu%20Samphan%20%5BEN%5D%20FINAL%2025%20May%202011.pdf">Khieu Samphan</a>, ex-foreign minister <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/Case%20Info%20Sheet%20-%20Ieng%20Sary%20%5BEN%5D%20Revised%2025%20May.pdf">Ieng Sary</a>, and his wife, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/Case%20Info%20Sheet%20Ieng%20Thirith%20%5BEN%5D%20FINAL%209%20June%202011.pdf">Ieng Thirith</a> [case profiles, PDFs], who served as minister for social affairs.

Australian blogger <a href="http://nikcub.appspot.com/">Nik Cubrilovic</a> [official website] <a href="http://nikcub-static.appspot.com/logging-out-of-facebook-is-not-enough">broke the initial news</a> [blog post] of Facebook tracking users and has since <a href="http://nikcub.appspot.com/facebook-fixes-logout-issue-explains-cookies">posted an update</a> [blog post] stating that Facebook has since "changed as much as they can change with the logout issue." Nonetheless, the Congressmen cited a statement from Facebook Director of Engineering, Arturo Bejar, that fully fixing the logout issue "will take a while" in petitioning for a FTC investigation. They believe that Facebook's conduct possibly falls within <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode15/usc_sec_15_00000045----000-.html">15 USC &#167; 45</a> [text], section 5 of the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/FTC_Act_IncorporatingUS_SAFE_WEB_Act.pdf">Federal Trade Commission Act</a> [text, PDF], which protects citizens from "unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce." The <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website] sent a letter to the FTC <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/facebook/EPIC_Facebook_FTC_letter.pdf">calling for an investigation into Facebook's conduct</a> [letter, PDF; <a href="http://epic.org/2011/09/epic-led-coalition-calls-for-f.html">press release</a>] as well. EPIC contends that Facebook is tracking user data so that it may sell the data to third-parties. EPIC also has a <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/facebook/EPIC_FB_FR_FTC_Complaint_06_10_11.pdf">complaint about Facebook's facial recognition system</a> [text, PDF], which automatically "tags" users when others upload photos of them, currently pending before the FTC.

<p>The <a href="http://www.datenschutz-hamburg.de/">Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information</a> [official website, in German] also filed a complaint over Facebook's facial recognition system in August, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/germany-authorities-says-facebook-facial-recognition-violates-european-data-protection-law.php">arguing that it violates European data protection laws</a> [JURIST report]. In December South Korea stated that Facebook was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/south-korea-says-facebook-not-complying-with-data-privacy-laws.php">not in compliance with the nation's data privacy laws</a> [JURIST report]. The South Korean authorities especially took issue with Facebook's alleged policy of gathering users' data without first obtaining consent from them. The Canadian <a href="http://www.priv.gc.ca/">Office of the Privacy Commissioner</a> [official website] announced in January 2010 that it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/canada-privacy-commissioner-launches.php">launch a probe</a> [JURIST report] into complaints that the website was violating users' privacy. In August 2009 five Facebook users brought suit against Facebook in California, alleging that the social networking <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/facebook-sued-in-california-court-for.php">violated their privacy</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Mahmoudi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-ex-pm-arrested-in-tunisia.php">arrested in Tunisia</a> [JURIST report] last week and sentenced to six months in prison for illegally entering the country. The conviction was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15083188">overturned</a> [BBC report] by a Tunisian appeals court, however. Al-Mahmoudi has since gone on <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Gadhafi+hunger+strike+Lawyer/5477424/story.html">hunger strike</a> [AFP report] in response to his detention by Tunisian authorities who are holding him based on a request from <a href="http://www.interpol.int/en">INTERPOL</a> [official website].

<p>Last month Al-Mahmoudi requested that the UN create a "high-level commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">investigate alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website].  Although NATO was mandated by the UN to use force in order to stop Muammar Gaddafi from fomenting violence upon Libyan citizens, the campaign has allegedly gone beyond the scope of protecting civilians and recently led to the death of 85 civilians in one night after NATO forces bombed a residential area supposedly housing a rebel command center. In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">after it published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Human rights groups have closely scrutinized Kazakhstan's adherence to its international human rights obligations. In April, Nazarbayev <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kazakhstan-president-fires-six-supreme-court-justices-for-corruption.php">discharged six justices</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.supcourt.kz/en/">Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan</a> [official website] for corruption.

Kazakhstan <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/KZsession7.aspx">accepted 121 of the recommendations</a> [Kazakhstan UPR materials] to reduce human rights violation, particularly with respect to freedom of the press.

AI cited evidence of rendition flights of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/z/abu_zubaydah/index.html">Abu Zubaydah</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zubaydah">news archive</a>] in 2005 revealed earlier this year by <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], a London-based human rights organization. AI counter-terrorism and human rights expert, Julia Hall, pressed authorities:<blockquote>The Lithuanian authorities should not hide behind the blanket claim of "state secrecy" to prevent allegations of disappearance and torture from being properly investigated. No one has been held accountable for helping the USA to construct these secret sites or for any violations that may have occurred in them. ... The Lithuanian authorities must reopen their investigation into these operations, including the activities of US officials, and hold accountable those responsible for complicity in all abuses that have taken place.</blockquote>Deputy prosecutor general, Darius Raulusaitis, indicated prosecutors would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hT4p-WSj1HtRUFaw8uE_9CMeywQQ?docId=2dbc9300427743d3b6ea50197dfe2a8c">decide whether the new evidence was significant enough</a> [AP report] to restart the investigation within a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/29/us-lithuania-cia-amnesty-idUSTRE78S4JU20110929">few weeks</a> [Reuters report].

<p>In January, human rights groups pressed for Lithuania's investigation to be reopened, calling the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urge-lithuania-to-reopen-cia-prison-investigation.php">decision to stop the investigation premature</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009, the Lithuanian Parliament National Security Committee reported that the CIA had established secret prisons for al Qaeda suspects in the Baltic country.

The <a href = "http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">filed the same complaint earlier this year</A> [JURIST report] in Geneva, Switzerland, forcing Bush to cancel a planned speaking engagement there, although for this suit they are joined with the <a href = "http://www.ccij.ca/index-e.php">Canadian Centre for International Justice</a> (CCIJ) [advocacy website]. Representatives of the CCR and CCIJ called for <a href = "http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/human-rights-groups-urge-bush-torture-prosecution">international accountability against the former president</a> [press release], and for Canada to exercise its justice system:<blockquote>Canada has a strong legal framework and there is absolutely no ambiguity in our criminal code when it comes to committing or allowing torture. There is grave evidence that former President Bush sanctioned and authorized acts of torture, not only in violation of Canadian laws, but also of international treaties that Canada has ratified. It is therefore clear that our government has both the jurisdiction and the obligation to prosecute Bush should he set foot again on Canadian territory.</blockquote>The groups allege a violation of the <a href = "http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> [text] and accuse Bush of sanctioning enforced disappearances and secret detention as well as a variety of acts of torture, including: "exposure to extreme temperatures, sleep deprivation, punching, kicking, isolation in 'coffin' cells for prolonged periods, threats of bad treatment, solitary confinement and forced nudity." Bush is scheduled to speak in Canada on October 20. Neither he nor the Canadian Justice Department have commented on the charges.

<p>Several human rights groups have urged investigations into alleged detainee abuses authorized by the Bush administration. This summer, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hrw-urges-probe-of-bush-administration-torture-allegations.php">urged the Obama administration to begin a criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged detainee abuses authorized by Bush following the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. Other calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">rejected consistently by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] urged US Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate Bush for violation of the federal statute prohibiting torture. Former defense secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Donald+Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive] also faced possible criminal charges, when, in 2007, a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/rumsfeld-war-crimes-complaint-filed-in.php">war crimes complaint was filed against him</a> [JURIST report] in Germany for his involvement in detainee treatment. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">case was later dismissed</a> [JURIST report]. In June 2010, the ACLU called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/aclu-renews-calls-for-bush-era-detainee-torture-investigation.php">stop shielding Bush administration officials</a> [JURIST report] from civil suit and criminal prosecution in relation to the treatment of detainees in US custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The National Safety Court of Appeal, a court composed of military prosecutors and civilian and military judges, sentenced defendant Ali Yusuf Abdulwahab Al Taweel to death for <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/474663">deliberately murdering a police officer</a> [BNA report] in an act of terror, endangering the lives of others, and spreading fear and terror during the protests. A second defendant, Mehdi Ali Attia, was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the officer's death. The court also sentenced 20 other alleged protesters, including 12 physicians who had <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-detainees-join-hunger-strike-rights-group.php">reportedly joined a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report], to terms ranging from five to ten years imprisonment for events occurring at a medical complex. The defendants were accused of having possession of Molotov cocktails and other weapons for the purposes of ousting the ruling regime, confiscating medical equipment, spreading lies and violating laws and regulations in order to disturb public security. The court also upheld the sentences of 21 other jailed anti-government protesters, after <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/bahrain-court-hears-protester-appeals.php">hearing their appeals</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39894&Cr=Bahrain&Cr1=">questioned the fairness of the proceedings</a> [UN News Centre report] stating that, "For such harsh sentences to be handed down to civilians in a military court with serious due process irregularities raises severe concerns." The OHCHR urged the Bahraini government to ensure that all detainees are charged with a recognizable criminal offense, and that they have enough time to prepare a defense. A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) [official website] also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/un-human-rights-office-criticizes-bahrain-sentences-for-protesters-medics/2011/09/30/gIQANyld9K_story.html">questioned the sentences of the physicians</a> [AP report], stating that health care workers have an ethical obligation to care for the injured, and they should not be punished for performing this duty. 

<p>Bahraini <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official profile] announced last month that he will <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/bahrain-king-dismisses-charges-against-some-protesters.php">dismiss charges against some of the protesters</a> [JURIST report] detained for their participation in pro-democracy demonstrations in the country. In June, Khalifa announced that an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-king-promises-independent-investigation-of-protest-crimes.php">independent commission will investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] related to the country's pro-democracy protests. Earlier that month, the OHCHR announced that Bahrain agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">permit a UN commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate human rights violations related to protests. The National Safety Courts were instituted in mid-March under Khalifa's <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and have been internationally criticized, most <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">recently</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-sentences-shiite-cleric-8-others-for-police-kidnapping.php">sentenced nine citizens</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in prison for kidnapping a police officer in May. In April, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">handed the death sentence</a> to four protesters, a rarity in Bahrain, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-upholds-2-death-sentencess-for-police-killings--dnp.php">upheld the sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for two of the men who were accused of murdering police officers. All of the charges levied in the National Safety Court have been disputed by Bahraini citizens and international rights organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontictr.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Appeals Chamber of the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] on Wednesday<a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/155/Default.aspx?id=1232">affirmed the convictions</a> [press release] of ex-army officer <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=98&mnid=2">Ephrem Setako</a> and former businessman <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=6&mnid=2">Yussuf Munyakazi</a> [case materials] on charges stemming from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Appeals Chamber dismissed Setako's appeal in its entirety and affirmed his conviction on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and murder of Tutsi at a military camp in northern Rwanda between April and May 1994. The prosecution's appeal in Setako's case was partially granted, with the court entering a new conviction against Setako related to the killings in May 1994. The Appeals Chamber determined that an additional conviction of murder as a serious violation of <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/375-590006">Article 3</a> [text] of the Geneva Convention was warranted for Setako but did not increase the length of his sentence. In affirming the conviction of Munyakazi on charges of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity, the Appeals Chamber <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Munyakazi/judgement/110928_summary.pdf">dismissed appeals</a> [judgment, PDF] by both the defense and prosecution. The trial court found Munyakazi liable for the deaths of more than 5,000 Tutsi civilians during the 1994 genocide and found that he "intended to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group in whole or in part." Munyakazi challenged the trial chamber's assessment of the evidence presented at trial, as well as assessment of the legal elements of the crimes for which he was charged. The Appeals Chamber found no error in either the trial chamber's weighing of evidence or interpretation of the elements of the crimes. The Appeals Chamber also determined that both Setako and Munyakazi should be credited for the time they have spent in prison since their arrests.   

<p>Setako was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/rwanda-tribunal-sentences-ex-army.php">convicted and sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 25 years in prison in February 2010 by the Trial Chamber of the ICTR. His trial <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ictr-begins-genocide-trial-of-former.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in August 2008. Setako was arrested in the Netherlands in February 2004 and later transferred to a UN detention facility. He subsequently pleaded not guilty. In July 2010, Munyakazi was also <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ictr-convicts-former-businessman-on-genocide-charges.php">sentenced to 25 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] by the Trial Chamber of the ICTR. Rwandan authorities had sought to have Munyakazi transferred to Rwanda for trial, but that request and the subsequent appeal were both <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/ictr-upholds-decision-to-refuse.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] based on concerns that the judiciary in Rwanda may not be fully independent and immune from outside pressure. The ICTR has <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-transfers-25-cases-to-rwandan-jurisdiction.php">transferred some cases</a> to the Rwandan courts, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ictr-transfers-case-of-former-pastor-to-rwanda-court.php">including the case</a> [JURIST reports] of former Rwandan pastor <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=75&mnid=1">Jean-Bosco Uwinkindi</a> [case materials], as part of a strategy intended to finish the court's trial work by 2011. Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga told the UN Security Council last year that the decisions by the ICTR not to transfer pending cases to Rwandan jurisdiction, including genocide suspect <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=2&mnid=2">Jean-Baptiste Gatete</a> [case materials], <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rwanda-prosecutor-criticizes-ictr.php">undermine judicial reforms</a> [JURIST report] and hinder national reconciliation. JURIST Guest Columnist and former Managing Editor Ingrid Burke, who has personal experience at the ICTR, argues that some <a href="/dateline/2010/06/tanzania-transferring-cases-from-the-ictr-to-rwanda-courts.php">cases ought to be referred to Rwandan courts</a> [JURIST op-ed], suggesting that doing so "is in the best interest of both the Rwandan judiciary's stability and the benefit of international criminal law in the future."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure, known as the "Women's Right to Know Act," would also require a physician to provide information to the woman regarding gestation, the risks of abortion procedures, abortion alternatives and federal medical benefits available. The plaintiffs claim that the law is unconstitutional under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First</a>, <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The complaint furthers alleges that the requirements will inflict significant harm on the doctor-patient relationship, harm the integrity of abortion providers and inflict harm on the abortion patients. The Legal Director for the <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/">ACLU of North Carolina Legal Foundation</a> [advocacy website], Katy Parker, said the new law would <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/?q=health-care-providers-file-lawsuit-challenge-demeaning-and-intrusive-north-carolina-ultrasound-law">create painful experiences</a> [press release] for women seeking abortions:<blockquote>This law forces a doctor, while performing an ultrasound, to describe the embryo or fetus and put pictures in front of the woman's face even if the woman says she doesn't want to see them. Imagine the pain this causes a woman who is forced to end a wanted pregnancy because of a catastrophic health emergency&#8212;or the additional trauma this unnecessary requirement will cause victims of rape or incest. No doctor should be forced to put a patient through that unnecessary trauma.</blockquote>The plaintiffs are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the legislation.

<p>The bill became law in July when the North Carolina <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">Senate</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-house-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">House of Representatives</a> voted to override a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-governor-vetoes-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">veto</a> [JURIST reports]<br />
by <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website]. North Carolina is one of several state legislatures to have acted recently to limit abortion rights. Both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-govenor-signs-bill-restricting-access-to-abortions.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] have recently passed bills requiring ultrasounds before abortions. In June, the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">lawsuit challenging the Texas law</a> [JURIST report]. In March, South Dakota passed a law requiring a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">three-day waiting period</a> [JURIST report] before an abortion&#8212;the longest waiting period requirement in the country. That law is also facing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">court challenge</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The strike marks the US government's most successful attack against al Qaeda since the raid leading to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan last May. The US-born radical Muslim cleric reportedly used his English and Internet skills to <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_YEMEN?SITE=ORMED&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">recruit individuals</a> [AP report] for attacks in the US. To help garner support for al Qaeda, Awlaki allegedly preached to people inside American mosques, and some of his talks were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/us-yemen-Awlaki-idUSTRE78T0W320110930">attended by the hijackers</a> [Reuters report] involved in the 9/11 attacks against the US. Forty-year-old Awlaki reportedly assumed a direct operational role in al Qaeda organizing attacks with other members in Yemen. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] criticized the targeted killing as a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-statement-killing-anwar-al-aulaqi">violation of both US and international law</a> [press release]. The US has increased drone strikes in Yemen to try and reduce al Qaeda's power in the region and minimize the chaos spilling over the border into Saudi Arabia. The US targeted Awlaki in a strike last May but missed. 

<p>Awlaki, a dual US-Yemeni citizen, had been approved for targeting killing by the Obama administration, an action that was challenged based on Awlaki's US citizenship. In December, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct "targeted killings" in al-Awlaki's case. Judge John Bates found that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, filed by the ACLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of Awlaki's father, dismissing it on procedural grounds and noting that important questions remain. Bates <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-hears-arguments-in-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November on the same day Awlaki called for jihadist attacks on US citizens in a video posted on extremist websites. Earlier in November, Yemeni prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-charges-us-born-cleric-with-terrorism-related-activities.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Awlaki with incitement to kill foreigners, and he was later sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to 10 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This decision is the most high-profile acquittal of the officials involved in the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>] during which 800,000 people were killed. The ICTR ordered the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE78T0B220110930?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FAFRICATopNews+%28News+%2F+AFRICA+%2F+Top+News%29">immediate release</a> [Reuters report] of Bizimungu, Rwanda's former health minister and Bicamumpaka, Rwanda's former foreign affairs minister. The Trial Chamber convicted both Justin Mugenzi and Prosper Mugiraneza for conspiracy to commit genocide and direct and public incitement to commit genocide, sentencing both individuals to 30 years in prison. Mugenzi and Mugiraneza were convicted of conspiracy to commit genocide and incitement to commit genocide for participating in the removal of Butare's Tutsi Prefect, Jean-Baptiste Habyalimana, and based on their participation in a joint criminal enterprise at the installation ceremony where President Theodore Sindikubwabo gave a speech inciting the killing of Tutsis. The trial commenced in 2004 and consisted of nearly 400 days of trial, during which the ICTR heard evidence from witnesses. 

<p>On Tuesday, the Appeals Chamber for the ICTR heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-hears-appeal-of-ex-army-officer.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case of <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/107.html">Aloys Ntabakuze</a> [HJP profile], a former Rwandan army officer convicted of genocide and related crimes. Ntabakuze appealed his December 2008 conviction, in which the Trial Chamber sentenced him to life imprisonment. Before a panel of five judges, Ntabakuze's lawyer requested an acquittal of the conviction because the prosecution lacked sufficient evidence and failed to provide adequate notice of the charges. Also on Tuesday, the Appeals Chamber heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-hears-appeal-of-former-official.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the appeal of Dominique Ntawukulilyayo, the former Sub-Prefect of the southern region of Gisagara. The five judges composing the Appeals Chamber will decide whether the Trial Chamber committed a number of errors of law and fact, as alleged by Ntawukulilyayo, who seeks a reversal of his conviction, an acquittal and immediate release or, in the alternative, a reduction of his sentence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Earlier this month, lawyers for the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked the appeals court to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/doj-asks-appeals-court-to-vacate-dont-ask-dont-tell-ruling.php">overturn that ruling</a> [JURIST report]. The DOJ argued that the impendency of the repeal rendered the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0902-dadt-20110902,0,275613.story">original court case moot</a> [LAT report]. The <a href="http://www.logcabin.org">Log Cabin Republicans</a> (LCR) [advocacy website], the gay rights group that sued over the policy, urged the appeals court to uphold the ruling to prevent the government from banning gay military service in the future, noting that the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-01/-don-t-ask-don-t-tell-ruling-is-moot-u-s-tells-court.html">new Congress may repeal the repeal</a> [Bloomberg report]. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the DOJ, holding that the suit became moot when the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.02965:">Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010</a> [HR 2965 materials] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/dont-ask-dont-tell-officially-repealed.php">took effect on September 20</a> [JURIST report], on the grounds that "the Supreme Court and our court have repeatedly held that a case is moot when the challenged statute is repealed, expires, or is amended to remove the challenged language." Circuit Judge Dairmuid O'Scannlain wrote a concurring opinion to say that the lower court failed to follow the Supreme Court's established law in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15714610278411834284">Lawrence v. Texas</a> [text] and created new rights for homosexuals by interpreting the decision too broadly.

<p>In July, the Ninth Circuit ruled that DADT would <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-again-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">remain partially in effect</a> [JURIST report] during the 60 days prior to its scheduled repeal. The court effectively reiterated its order <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ninth-circuit-partially-reinstates-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">issued the previous week</a> [JURIST report] in which it reinstated DADT but explicitly ordered the military to refrain from investigating, penalizing or discharging any of its members as originally provided for under the policy. Hours earlier, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Defense Secretary Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] and the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/obama-certifies-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">certified</a> [JURIST report] DADT's repeal, scheduling the policy to end September 20. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed the bill to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report] in December. The DADT Repeal Act was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">approved by the Senate</a> in December after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the House of Representatives the week before. Since the enactment of DADT in 1993, approximately 13,000 servicemen and women have been discharged from the armed forces as a result of the policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law prohibits comprehensive insurance plans from covering any abortion other than to save a woman's life but allows companies to offer a separate rider to cover abortions for an additional cost. The law will also ban coverage for abortion except in very limited instances in policies sold after 2014 under the new federal health care law. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-challenges-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">initially filed the suit challenging the law</a> [JURIST report] last month. The ACLU argued that the law was invalid because its sole purpose was to make it more difficult for women to obtain abortion care. In explaining his reasoning, Judge Wesley Brown stated:<blockquote>Where a law can be viewed as having a rational purpose other than simply obstructing the right to abortion, the court cannot presume that an invalid purpose actually motivated the legislature to adopt the law, let alone that the invalid purpose was the legislature's predominant motive.</blockquote> Because of the denial of the injunction, the law will remain in effect while the litigation proceeds.

<p>Kansas has recently imposed several other abortion restrictions. Last month, the state <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/kansas-appeals-order-to-block-law-defunding-planned-parenthood.php">filed an appeal</a> seeking to overturn a federal judge's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-law-defunding-of-planned-parenthood.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] that blocks a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/hb2014/">law</a> [HB 2014 materials] preventing <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/kansas-mid-missouri/">Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri</a> (PPKM) [advocacy website] from receiving federal funding. In July a judge for the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-abortion-law-requiring-licenses-for-clinics.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to block a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/sb36/">regulation</a> [SB 36 materials] requiring clinics within the state to obtain a license to perform abortions. In April, Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">signed two pieces of legislation</a> [JURIST report] restricting abortions in the state. The <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF] requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed, and the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">"fetal pain bill"</a> [HB 2218, PDF] restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Brazil judge blocks Amazon jungle dam construction</title>

The USD $11 billion project would be the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-15102520">third-largest hydroelectric dam in the world</a> [BBC report]. In deciding to suspend the project, the judge cited the damage the dam would cause to fishing for indigenous people. The government argued that the dam would provide the clean, renewable energy the country needs to meet growing energy needs.

<p>Earlier this month, the Malaysian <a href="http://202.75.7.131/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=66&Itemid=33&lang=enhttp://202.75.7.131/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=66&Itemid=33&lang=en">Federal Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-court-rules-against-indigenous-people-in-land-rights-suit.php">unanimously ruled against indigenous people</a> [JURIST report] challenging a similar hydroelectric dam. The indigenous people argued that they received inadequate compensation for the Sarawak government's seizure of their land to build the dam. The judges stated that if the plaintiffs were not satisfied with the amount of compensation then that is a matter for arbitration, not for the court. In December, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-pledges-support-for-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">pledged to support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [JURIST report], a non-binding UN treaty expressing support for the rights of indigenous peoples. The US was the last member to lend its support to the treaty. In August 2010, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called on governments to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-calls-for-greater-efforts-on-indigenous-rights.php">improve the living conditions of indigenous peoples</a> [JURIST report] and support the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.</p>]]></content:encoded>
