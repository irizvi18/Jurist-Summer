California is the first state to pass a law banning this type of therapy. The bill was supported by the <a href="http://www.naswca.org/">National Association of Social Workers</a>, California Chapter, the <a href="http://aamftca.org/">American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy</a>, California Division, the <a href="http://www.apsa.org/">American Psychoanalytic Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.bbs.ca.gov/">California Board of Behavioral Sciences</a> [advocacy websites], and the signing was <a href="http://www.hrc.org/blog/entry/ca-gov.-brown-signs-sb-1172-protecting-californias-youth">welcomed</a> by groups such as the <a href="http://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a> [advocacy website]. According to the text of the law:<blockquote>The potential risks of reparative therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already experienced by the patient. Many patients who have undergone reparative therapy relate that they were inaccurately told that homosexuals are lonely, unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or satisfaction.</blockquote>The law will <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/State-bans-gay-repair-therapy-for-minors-3906032.php">take effect</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] on January 1. Violators face disciplinary action from their licensing authority. 

<p>SB 1172 was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">approved by the California State Assembly</a> at the end of August and by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Supporters of the bill asserted that the underlying reason for the legislation is that homosexuality is not a disease and should not be treated as such. Furthermore, therapies and efforts to reverse homosexuality were found to have detrimental effects on minors' physical and mental health, leading to suicides and substance abuse. Conversely, groups such as the <a href="http://narth.com/">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> [advocacy website] voiced their opposition, arguing that most of the facts relied on in the bill are generalizations and loose assertions. According to some experts, California's efforts to pass the ban on sexual orientation therapy have highlighted a <a href="/forum/2012/09/mary-ziegler-gender-standards.php">need for better gender identity standards</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The move led prosecutors to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20121001/176332910.html">accuse the defense</a> [RIA Novosti report] of causing deliberate delays. However defense lawyer Nikolai Polozov said that Samutsevich may have made the decision due to <a href="http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/article/24724539.html">pressure from the government</a> [RFE/RL report, in Russian]. Samutsevich's bandmates Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina declined to fire their lawyers but said that Samutsevich is acting within her legal rights. The trial is now scheduled to reconvene on October 10. 

<p>Pussy Riot band members Samutsevich, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina are serving two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. Several days prior to the trial, Russian <a href="http://premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] called for the release of the Pussy Riot band members, saying that time served has been severe enough and that any more time in prison would be counterproductive. The <a href="http://www.president-sovet.ru/">Russian Presidential Council on Human Rights</a> [official website, in Russian] has <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-rights-council-questions-prison-sentences-for-feminist-activist-band-members.php">questioned the legitimacy</a> [JURIST report] of the court's verdict and sentence. Pussy Riot's defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-ask-judge-to-recuse-herself-in-trial.php">moved</a> [JURIST report] earlier in August to have one of the judges recuse herself from the case, saying her decisions are politically motivated. Since the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-face-trial-for-controversial-protest-performance.php">beginning of the trial</a> [JURIST report], the group's lawyers and human rights groups have said the charges were politically motivated by <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin">news archive</a>] to discredit his opposition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In anticipation of the Monday proceedings the Hulhumale Magistrate Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/maldives-court-restricts-ex-president-to-capital.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] last week prohibiting Nasheed from leaving Male without official permission. Nasheed supporters have claimed that the move was politically motivated to limit the ex-president's ability to campaign for the election scheduled for November 2013. The three-judge panel was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/maldives/9579020/Former-Maldives-president-flees-trial-in-boat.html">forced to postpone Nasheed's impending trial</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] after he was seen leaving Male in a boat heading to the southern area of the country. According to Nasheed the court inexplicably <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/01/maldives-postpones-trial-former-president">ordered a last-minute postponement</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] of the trial, at which point he decided to violate his travel ban in order to campaign in the Maldives' southern islands. Nasheed cited freedom of travel principles and almost dared the authorities to arrest him, predicting such a move would backfire on the government by creating political capital for the former president. Nasheed resigned from office in February but has since claimed that he was forced to do so.

<p>The charges against Nasheed stem from the questioned legality of his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilateral order to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed on corruption charges in January, when Nasheed was still president. The arrest of the chief justice and the resulting unrest in Maldives sparked weeks of tension and dissension, drawing international attention. In August a Maldives <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/maldives-commission-rules-former-presidents-resignation-was-voluntary.php">commission of inquiry</a> concluded that <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-president-resigns-after-protests-over-detained-judge.php">Nasheed's resignation</a> [JURIST reports] in February was legal and voluntary. In July the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/journalist-rights-group-concerned-about-press-freedom-in-maldives.php">claimed that press freedom</a> [JURIST report] in the country has been deteriorating since the resignation. Also in July a Maldives court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/maldives-court-refuses-to-hear-case-against-former-president.php">refused to hear the case</a> [JURIST report] against Nasheed, holding that it did not have jurisdiction to rule in the case. In April the Maldives Police Service <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/maldive-police-service-sends-criminal-court-chief-arrest-case-to-prosecutor.php">referred the case</a> to the Prosecutor General's Office two months after an <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ex-president.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] was issued. A group of Maldives lawyers in January <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-lawyers-seek-icc-intervention-over-detained-judge.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] to review the legality of the arrest of Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed. Also that month the Maldives Minister of Foreign Affairs had <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-seeks-un-help-to-resolve-detention-of-senior-judge.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the UN to help them to resolve the unrest arising out of the arrest of the chief justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to BNA, the medics were working at <a href="http://www.moh.gov.bh/EN/HealthEstablishment/SMC.aspx">Salmaniya Medical Complex</a> [official website], and, during the time of the uprising, "took over the complex, detained and imprisoned kidnapped persons, and transformed the hospital to a place of illegal gathering and strikes, in violation of laws." <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/issues/persecution-of-health-workers/bahrain/medics-on-trial-in-bahrain.html">According to Physicians for Human Rights</a> [PHR report], however, at least 95 health workers were arrested in Bahrain only after some medics treated those hurt by security forces and spoke out against the crackdown against protesters, which included firing upon ambulances. One medic, Dr. Ali al-Ekri, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. Another medic was sentenced to three years while the remaining seven were sentenced to a one-month minimum and one-year maximum term. The nine medics were originally accused and sentenced by the Court of National Security.

<p>A total of 20 medics, including 13 doctors, one dentist, nurses and paramedics, were originally jailed and sentenced in September 2011 for providing treatment to injured protesters after the Salmaniya Medical Complex was stormed by security forces in March. Though originally sentenced to 15 years in prison, a Bahrain court in June of this year <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bahrain-court-r.php">overturned or reduced the sentences</a> [JURIST report] for most of the medical professionals. In November <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.bh/Default.aspx?tabid=137&language=en-US">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-king-orders-commission-to-study-report-on-rights-violations.php">ordered a special commission</a> [JURIST report] to make recommendations after the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) concluded in a report that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">Bahraini authorities used excessive force</a> [JURIST report] and tortured detained protesters during the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier that year. In October 2011 a Bahrain court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-court-hears-appeals-of-20-convicted-medics.php">began hearing the appeals</a> [JURIST report] the 20 convicted medical staff members. They were granted the opportunity for <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-grants-retrials-to-20-convicted-medics.php">retrial in civilian court</a> [JURIST report] earlier that month after their harsh sentences received international criticism. Shortly after their arrest and sentence, the medics <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/bahrain-medics-urge-un-probe-of-convictions.php">urged the UN </a> to investigate claims of abuse and due process violations in relation to their convictions.

Specifically, the legislation will amend the state's driver's license regulations to make hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants eligible to drive legally in California if they qualify for a new federal work permit program. In essence, the law directs California's Department of Motor Vehicles to issue driver's licenses to people who do not have a social security number but can prove they are <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/news/bill-370080-driver-assembly.html">authorized to be in the US under federal law</a> [<em>Orange County Register</em> report]. Though a previous version was signed into law in 2003 by former governor Gray Davis, the legislature quickly repealed it following Davis' departure from office. The current version, authored by <a href="http://asmdc.org/members/a45/">Assemblyman Gil Cedillo</a> [official website], has received support from several Republican congressmen and is believed to be in line with the Obama administration's <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf">policy directive</a> [memorandum, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/obama-administration-to-stop-deporting-some-young-undocumented-immigrants.php">report</a>] known as Deferred Action, which halts deportation proceedings against some illegal immigrants who came to the US as children. Likewise, the directive also allows illegal immigrants who entered the US before the age of 16 and who are now 30 or younger, in addition to other criteria, to obtain work permits.

<p>The <a href="http://assembly.ca.gov/">California State Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-approves-bill-allowing-some-illegal-immigrants-to-get-drivers-licenses.php">approved the bill</a> in August 31, only two days after the <a href="http://senate.ca.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] first approved it. Despite California's latest initiative, however, <a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a hot button issue in many states. In September lawyers for Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] announced a plan to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/arizona-to-appeal-federal-injunction-on-portion-of-state-immigration-law.php">appeal a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] currently blocking the provision of the controversial Arizona immigration law that criminalizes the harboring and transportation of illegal immigrants. In August, Kansas <a href="http://www.kriskobach.org/">Secretary of State Kris Kobach</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-secretary-of-state-challenges-obama-administration-immigration-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Deferred Action policy directive. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">partially struck down</a> [JURIST report] Alabama and Georgia's immigration laws, but upheld other provisions. Also in August, Utah's Attorney General argued that the state's restrictive immigration law <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/utah-attorney-general-immigration-law-should-be-upheld-given-supreme-court-ruling.php">should be upheld</a> [JURIST report] in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf">Arizona v.

Mam Sonando, 71, runs the independent Beehive radio station and has been an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itjSEgP_irLXkC295rkskXqtrM5w?docId=CNG.8abe2f71b33c3c1476737232dfa0bd37.b41">outspoken critic of the Cambodian government</a> [AFP report]. He was arrested in July on accusations of being involved in a plot to incite villagers in eastern Kratie to rebel against the Cambodian government in an effort to establish an autonomous region in the province. The court held that Sonando had been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19783123">instrumental in inciting villagers</a> [BBC report] in May to form their own state in the eastern province. An additional 13 people were convicted on similar indictments. Rights groups have denounced the charges and Sonando's supporters say he is being <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/01/us-cambodia-land-idUSBRE8900ER20121001">persecuted for criticizing the government</a> [Reuters report]. Several hundred people assembled outside the court in support of the rights activist as his sentence was being handed down. The <a href="http://www.phnompenh.gov.kh/">Phnom Penh</a> [official website] court also fined Sonando 10 million riel (USD $2,500). His wife has indicated that he plans to appeal the sentence.

<p>Cambodia's government has a turbulent history. Last month the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] released the former "First Lady" of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khmer+Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> [JURIST news archive] regime, Ieng Thirith. The court ruled that she should be released due her degenerative illness, said to likely be Alzheimer's. Thirith, the sister-in-law of former leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/pot_pol.shtml">Pol Pot</a> [BBC backgrounder], has always denied any wrongdoing. The ECCC has only convicted one former Khmer Rouge leader, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier in September the ECCC announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/eccc-announces-declassification-of-documents-related-to-war-crimes-trial.php">declassify more than 1,700 war crimes documents</a> [JURIST report] in efforts toward more convictions. Ieng Thirith was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cambodia-genocide-court-indicts-4-ex-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in September 2010 along with Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea. The ECCC ruled in November that Ieng Thirith was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/with-only-a-few-days.php">unfit to stand trial</a>, but the Supreme Court Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-blocks-release-of-khmer-rouge-leader.php">ordered that she remain in detention</a> [JURIST reports] and that the Trial Chamber exhaust all measures so that she can stand trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1491rearg.pdf">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Kiobel">news archive</a>], the court heard new arguments on whether three oil companies are immune from US lawsuits under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute of 1789</a> (ATS) [text] for alleged torture and international law violations that took place overseas. The court initially <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">heard arguments in February</a> and then directed the parties to <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-to-rehear-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-human-rights-violations.php">file briefs on a new question</a> [JURIST reports] for this term, which asked if the ATS can ever be used against against non-state citizens for atrocities committed in that state, and under what circumstances. The petitioners, a group of Nigerian refugees who allege torture and murder at the hand of several US-incorporated oil companies active in Nigeria, argued the standard should be based on the principle of universal jurisdiction:<blockquote>[I]f, in fact, the US corporation committed a violation of the universal jurisdiction norm, for example, as we believe these norms are in this case, there are many jurisdictions in which US corporations could be&#8212;could be sued. ... [I]t is possible that the plaintiffs could have sued in other places. They sued here because this is where they live. This is their adopted homeland because of that. The United States, under international law, clearly has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims between parties properly before them.</blockquote>The respondents, an attorney representing several Dutch and American oil companies, argued that the ATS only applies to "extraterritorial application of US law" and should not be extended to violations of other territories' laws that the US could enforce. The Solicitor General, representing the federal government's stance on the issue, argued for an interpretation that does not allow the prosecution of foreign companies committing extraterritorial acts "when the allegation is that the defendant aided and abetted a foreign sovereign."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-626.pdf">Lozman v. Riviera Beach</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-university-of-texas-affirmative-action-policy.php">report</a>] on whether a permanently and indefinitely docked structure is a vessel for the purposes of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/3">1 USC &#167; 3</a> [text], thus triggering <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00670.htm">federal maritime jurisdiction</a> [DOJ backgrounder]. In this case, petitioner Faze Lozman's <a href = "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/us-high-court-decision-in-hyperlocal-riviera-beach/nSQCF/">docked houseboat came under scrutiny</a> [<em>Palm Beach Post</em> report] when Riviera Beach wanted to redevelop the marina in which he had it stationed. To do this, they used maritime law to put a lien against his property, alleging that he had to register the houseboat as a "vessel." Lozman, for whom the US government also argued, stated that the houseboat is not a vessel, as it is not practically suited for any maritime transportation. The attorney for Riviera Beach argued that the houseboat is a vessel because it "floats, moves, and carries people or things on water." The justices appeared to hinge the distinction on whether any floating object is a vessel for the purposes of the statute, querying if this would also apply to objects including an inner tube, an inflatable raft, a floating casino, an aircraft carrier and a log.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] opened its 2012 term on Monday with the release of an <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/100112zor.pdf">order list</a> [PDF] dealing with a number of petitions for <em>certiorari</em> and granting orders in some cases that they have not yet decided to hear. Notably, the court ordered a response petition in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-438.htm">Liberty University v. Geithner</a> [docket; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/liberty-university-asks-supreme-court-to-review-health-care-law.php">report</a>], which could portend a rehearing of the <a href = "/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [JURIST backgrounder].

<p>The court asked the Solicitor General for a brief in <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11a1103.htm">Arzoumanian v. Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft AG</a> [docket; <a href = "http://www.anca.org/legal/insuranceclaims/">case materials</a>], a case that concerns Armenian-Americans' ability to file claims for life insurance policies their deceased Armenian family members bought before the <A href = "http://www.armenian-genocide.org/genocidefaq.html">Armenian genocide</a> [backgrounder], committed during World War 1. The policies were never paid out by the German insurance company. The Turkish government does not recognize the genocide and has consistently filed <em>amicus</em> briefs in the case to dispute those allegations.</p>

<p>The court gave summary dispositions in two redistricting cases, allowing both redistricting maps to stand in <A href = "http://dockets.justia.com/docket/illinois/ilndce/1:2011cv04884/257964/">Radogno v. Illinois Board of Elections</a> and <a href = "http://dockets.justia.com/docket/south-carolina/scdce/3:2011cv03120/187251/">Backus v. South Carolina</a> [Justia backgrounders].</p>

<p>The court denied <em>certiorari</em> in three high profile cases. In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1413.htm">Corbett v. United States</a> [docket; <em>Reason</em> <A href= "http://reason.com/blog/2012/10/02/fourth-amendment-challenge-to-tsa-scanne">backgrounder</a>] the court declined to consider whether body scans conducted by the <a href = "http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website] violate the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. The court also denied <em>certiorari</em> in <span class = "casename">Wyoming v. Dept. of Agriculture</span> and <A href = "/paperchase/2011/10/tenth-circuit-reinstates-prohibitions-on-construction-timber-removal-in-national-forests.php">Colorado Mining Association v. Dept. of Agriculture</a> [JURIST report], allowing the <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=roadless+rule">"roadless rule"</a> [JURIST news archive] to stand, which prevents road-building and commercial timber harvesting on expanses of roadless areas around the country, primarily the National Forests. The court also let stand a US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <A href = "http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/getopn.pl?OPINION=11-1196P.01A">decision</a> [opinion] that will compel the <A href = "http://www.nationformarriage.org/site/c.omL2KeN0LzH/b.7980587/k.BF50/Home.htm">National Organization for Marriage</a> (NOM) [advocacy website] to release its donor list, under a Maine campaign disclosure law. NOM is one of the most prolific advocates against same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1491.htm">Sibley v. Supreme Court of the United States</a> [docket], the court granted an automatic affirmation of a DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the Supreme Court has judicial immunity in the lawsuit. The court lacked a quorum in the case, as every justice except Justice Elena Kagan was implicated in the original suit, which stems back to 2006. Attorney  <a href = "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/03/AR2007050302233_pf.html">Montgomery Blair Sibley</a> [WP profile] sued the Supreme Court and three US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit judges for treason and violating his right to a fair tribunal, because they did not recuse themselves on a previous suit where he had declared all of them defendants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE12/017/2012/en/a6fbc51f-a151-4b74-8c93-7b625d5cdb75/mde120172012en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] "Egypt: Brutality unpunished and unchecked: Egypt's military kill and torture protesters with impunity," AI says that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) broke its promises to protect human rights and has betrayed the people who catalyzed Egypt's "January Revolution." The report goes on to discuss virginity tests used on female protesters, the use of excessive force by the military transitional government, and the lack of resources and time afforded to a government commission that was tasked with investigating rights abuses. In the second <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE12/029/2012/en/576aa9cc-bd07-4724-a410-95b02009c317/mde120292012en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], "Agents of repression: Egypt's police and the case for reform," AI discusses the framework of impunity within which Egypt's law enforcement agencies operate. According to the report:<blockquote>For many years, Egyptians viewed the police as a body to be avoided because of its record of human rights violations, rather than as an institution to resort to for protection. The Egyptian authorities today have a unique opportunity to rebuild the trust of the public in the police by ensuring significant and transparent reform is initiated. ... President Morsi should ensure that Egypt's new Constitution guarantees human rights, including, as a minimum, all those recognized and protected by international human rights treaties to which Egypt is a party. It must also ensure that the security forces most associated with abuse are revamped into accountable institutions serving everyone in Egypt without discrimination.</blockquote>According to AI, without accountability for past human rights abuses and genuine reform to prevent impunity, justice for the victims of abuses will remain elusive. 

<p>There have been several controversial trials since the end of the revolution. At the end of September Egyptian Defence Minister General Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-soldiers-receive-suspended-sentences-for-protests.php">ordered a reduced sentence</a> [JURIST report] for a group of military officers who took part in opposition protests in April 2011. There were 22 officers, known as the April 8 Officers, arrested for their <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/tens-thousands-tahrir-some-threaten-extend-protests">participation in protests</a> [Egyptian Independent report] in support of the revolution and against SCAF and against retired Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi Soliman. Earlier in September an Egyptian court upheld the <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/jurist-an-egyptian-criminal-court.php">death sentences</a> for 14 Islamists, and a court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-court-sentences-former-pm-to-three-years-for-corruption.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] former prime minister Ahmed Nazif to three years for corruption. In August the former secretary for Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges. He was accused of having abused his office by obtaining real estate at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, along with seven others, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mubaraks-sons-charged-with-stock-market-fraud.php">charged with stock market fraud</a> [JURIST report] and using unfair trading practices and illegally manipulating the market.</p>]]></content:encoded>

California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] on Saturday <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1172_bill_20120416_amended_sen_v97.html">bill</a> [SB 1172; Senate <a href="http://sd28.senate.ca.gov/sites/sd28.senate.ca.gov/files/SB%201172%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">backgrounder</a>, PDF] into law on Saturday, banning therapy intended to change the sexual orientation of minors. According to PJI attorneys, the law is an unconstitutional restriction on the First Amendment, privacy and parental rights. According to the complaint:<blockquote>The prohibitions of SB 1172 unlawfully create a new category of banned speech, namely "sexual orientation change efforts" directed at minors. This includes gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning youth. This new category of banned speech bears no relation to the few categories of speech that have been recognized by the courts as unprotected speech. Moreover, the prohibitions of SB 1172 are invalidly rooted in content and viewpoint distinctions.</blockquote>PJI is also seeking an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect on January 1. A separate lawsuit is planned by the <a href="http://narth.com/">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> (NARTH) [advocacy website].

<p>SB 1172 was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">approved by the California State Assembly</a> at the end of August and by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Supporters of the bill asserted that the underlying reason for the legislation is that homosexuality is not a disease and should not be treated as such. Furthermore, therapies and efforts to reverse homosexuality were found to have detrimental effects on minors' physical and mental health, leading to suicides and substance abuse. Conversely, groups such as NARTH voiced their opposition, arguing that most of the facts relied on in the bill are generalizations and loose assertions. According to some experts, California's efforts to pass the ban on sexual orientation therapy have highlighted a <a href="/forum/2012/09/mary-ziegler-gender-standards.php">need for better gender identity standards</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the sales ban should be lifted after the jury found that Samsung did not infringe the patent that was the primary basis for the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/apple-wins-preliminary-injunction-against-samsung-tablet.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung's Galaxy 10.1. In a separate action on Tuesday, Samsung filed a motion alleging that Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone5</a> [product information] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/samsung-to-add-latest-iphone-to-apple-patent-infringement-lawsuit.php">infringes</a> [JURIST report] on some of the South Korean company's patents.

On remand from the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/T/SupremeCourt/">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a> [official website], Judge Robert Simpson enjoined enforcement of Act 18, which amended the provisional ballot section of the Election Code. Simpson held that Act 18 could cause voter disenfranchisement by requiring that all voters present a state issued or federal government issued photo ID in order to cast their ballot in the upcoming election. He explained that the photo ID requirements in the state's voter ID law do not conform with the "liberal access" standard set out by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Simpson reasoned:<blockquote>First and foremost, the evidence is similar in kind to the prospective "assurances of government officials" testimony which the Supreme Court found an unsatisfactory basis for a "predictive judgment." ... Second, the proposed changes are to occur about five weeks before the general election, and I question whether sufficient time now remains to attain the goal of liberal access. Third, the proposed changes are accompanied by candid admissions by government officials that any new deployment will reveal unforeseen problems which impede implementation.</blockquote>The preliminary injunction preventing Pennsylvania's voter ID law will only remain in effect for the November election, as instructed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. With five weeks remaining until election day, this decision could still be appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a contentious issue in the US, particularly in the run-up to the November presidential election. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">32 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, but the issue remains controversial. Last month the Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-supreme-court-remands-voter-id-case-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-judge-refuses-to-block-voter-id-law.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court upholding the state's new voter identification law and remanded for further consideration. The Supreme Court's order, issued per curiam, suggested that it may be logistically impossible to implement the law by the November election, due to conflicts with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), the primary outpost for obtaining photo ID acceptable to the new law. They remanded the case to the Commonwealth court to "consider whether the procedures being used for deployment of the cards comport with the requirement of liberal access which the General Assembly attached to the issuance of PennDOT identification cards."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bunka.go.jp/chosakuken/24_houkaisei.html">revised law</a> [materials, in Japanese] now <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19767970">imposes penalties</a> [BBC report] of two years in prison and fines of up to two million yen (USD $25,627) upon those who illegally download copyrighted files. The law was revised in June with the purpose of protecting copyrights by preventing illegal downloads. Before the revision, the copyright law punished only those who illegally uploaded copyrighted materials with up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million yen (USD $128,139). The <a href="http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/index.html">Recording Industry Association of Japan</a> [advocacy website] had advocated for the revision arguing that illegal downloads of copyrighted files have detrimental effect on the country's music industry outnumbering legal downloads by a factor of 10. Critics argued that the new law increases the risk of abuse by authorities who will be allowed to target any Internet user.

<p>Copyright infringement is an international concern. Last month the <a href="http://www.asamblea.gob.pa/main/">National Assembly of Panama</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/panama-legislature-passes-copyright-law-with-heavy-fines-for-violators.php">approved a controversial new copyright law </a> [JURIST report] that allows authorities to fine infringers without a trial or civil lawsuit. The law allows the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to impose fines of up to $100,000 on individuals who are found to be in unlawful possession of copyrighted materials. In June two of the founders of the file-sharing website The Pirate Bay (TPB) <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pirate-bay-founders-appeal-to-human-rights-court.php">filed appeals</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/Homepage_En/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging their convictions for copyright violations in a Swedish court after the <a href="http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/">Swedish Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/sweden-high-court-refuses-to-hear-appeal-in-pirate-bay-case.php">refused to hear</a> [JURIST report] their appeal earlier this year.

The <a href="http://ffrf.org/">Freedom from Religion Foundation</a> (FFRF) [advocacy website] claimed that HR 535 violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The defendants in the case, Representatives <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/House_bio.cfm?id=1219">Rick Saccone</a>, <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/house/house_nonMbr.cfm?officer=2&office=Parliamentarian">Clancy Myer</a> and <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/house/house_nonMbr.cfm?officer=11&office=Chief%20Clerk">Anthony Frank Barbush</a> [official profiles], argued two causes for dismissal: a lack of standing under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution, and being shielded through legislative immunity, which protects a legislator's right to speech and debate during legislative proceedings. Judge Christopher Conner held that, while the FFRF did have standing, the defendants had absolute immunity from FFRF's suit through the doctrine of legislative immunity. However, the judge also rebuked the resolution, concluding:<blockquote>The vast majority of legislative resolutions are entirely appropriate and serve legitimate public purposes, such as honoring or commemorating individual achievements, notable anniversaries, Commonwealth resources, and military service and sacrifice. ... However, the court's determination that the defendants engaged in a "legislative act" for purposes of immunity should not be viewed as judicial endorsement of this resolution. It most certainly is not. ... This judicial rebuke of the resolution is not intended to impugn the religious beliefs of any citizen. To the contrary, the court's disapprobation is directed to the blatant use of legislative resources in contravention of the spirit&#8212;if not the letter&#8212;of the Establishment Clause.</blockquote>The FFRF <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/pennsylvania-year-of-the-bible-resolution-challenged.php">filed the suit</a> [JURIST report] in March.

<p>The separation of church and state has been and remains a <a href="/dateline/2012/02/edward-sanfilippo-first-amendment.php">controversial issue</a> [JURIST op-ed] in American courts. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/us-appeals-court-allows-suit-opposing-ten-commandments-monument-to-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May that a lawsuit opposing a Ten Commandments monument displayed on property owned by the City of Fargo, North Dakota, may move forward. In January the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-county-board-meeting-prayers.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] a case concerning whether a county board of commissioners in North Carolina violated the Establishment Clause by opening its public meetings with prayers. The court's denial of <em>certiorari</em> in the case preserved a ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ruling-that-county-board-meeting-prayers-violated-first-amendment.php">holding</a> [JURIST report] that that the board of commissioners violated the Establishment Clause by effectively using a public forum to endorse Christianity. Earlier that month a federal judge ordered Florida's Dixie County Courthouse to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-rules-florida-courthouse-must-remove-ten-commandments-monument.php">remove the Ten Commandments monument</a> [JURIST report] displayed on the front steps of the courthouse, concluding that the monument's religious message would be interpreted to be espoused by the government. In April 2010 a federal judge in Wisconsin famously <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-rules-national-day-of.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Congressional <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/119">legislation</a> [text] from 1952 establishing a <a href="http://www.ndptf.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> [advocacy website] was unconstitutional. There, in receiving a grant of summary judgment, the FFRF successfully argued that, by passing the aforementioned statute, the government had improperly endorsed religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-192.pdf">US v. Bormes</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments to determine whether the federal government has sovereign immunity for damages arising from the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CF4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftc.gov%2Fos%2Fstatutes%2F031224fcra.pdf&ei=f6UVT8bDPOPr0gGUo_yRAw&usg=AFQjCNFuAtXmfAcFofNRWi5MCc_SOoE32A&sig2=kcMjtGh1NkOxyKCou0NJUQ">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA) [text, PDF]. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in 2010 that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/tucker_act">Little Tucker Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1545224.html">waived sovereign immunity</a> [opinion] for money claims against the US under the FCRA. The Solicitor General's office argued that the government can only waive its sovereign immunity when it unequivocally expresses the intent to do so, which it does not under the Tucker Act. In the Solicitor General's view, immunity can only be waived when a statute "does not contain its own remedial mechanism" and "substantive obligations in the statute run against [only] the United States." The respondent, an attorney for plaintiff lawyer James Bormes, argued that since the government explicitly retained sovereign immunity in section 1681b of the FCRA, it waived immunity by not explicitly stating that in the Tucker Act.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-184.pdf">Kloeckner v. Solis</a> [transcript] to determine appellate jurisdiction in wrongful termination and discrimination cases for federal employees. At issue is whether a party may appeal a case involving both wrongful termination and discrimination claims to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a district court, when the <a href="http://www.mspb.gov/">Merit Systems Protection Board</a> (MSPB) [official website] decides the case without determining the merits of a discrimination claim. The petitioner argued for the district court, stating that district courts have jurisdiction over "all mixed cases" and later noted that appeals of the MSPB appear to require <em>de novo</em> review, which the Federal circuit cannot provide. The Solicitor General's attorney argued that <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1295">28 USC &#167; 1295</a> [text] provides that the Federal Circuit has automatic jurisdiction over all MSPB decisions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, roughly translated as the "the law on the protection of children's rights to safe information space" would amend laws to create liability for promoting homosexuality, although it does not specify what constitutes promotion of homosexuality. It would also include a criminal provision for importing, producing or distributing documents that both promote homosexuality and, in some way, promote religious intolerance, national intolerance, racism or discrimination, among other offenses. A representative for <a href = "http://www.insight-ukraine.org.ua/">Insight Ukraine</a> [advocacy website, in Russian], told <em>Gay Star News</em> that the law is <ahref = "http://gaystarnews.com/article/ukraine-votes-anti-gay-propaganda-law021012">so vague as to be dangerous</a> [GSN report], possibly implicating interviews with the media and public protests. The draft law, initially approved by 289 out of 350 MPs present, will receive a second reading, where the <a href = "http://www.mfa.gov.ua/mfa/en">Foreign Ministry of the Ukraine</a> [official website] stated that parliament will consider <a href = "http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/119916/">Ukraine's international obligations</a> [Interfax report] to human rights.

<p>The draft law is modeled off of a <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/russia-city-law-bans-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">law in St. Petersburg, Russia</a> [JURIST report] that imposes fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality, including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. The <a href = "/paperchase/2012/05/russia-gay-activist-first-to-be-convicted-under-controversial-city-ordinance.php">first conviction</a> [JURIST report] under the law occurred in April, when a gay rights activist was fined for picketing in front of city hall with a sign that said "homosexuality is not perversion." LGBT rights activists continue to <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/russia-gay-rights-activist-challenges-homosexual-propaganda-law.php">challenge the law</a> [JURIST report]. The Russian parliament <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/russia-lawmakers-introduce-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced a similar law</a> [JURIST report] shortly after the St. Petersburg law passed, but it has yet to pass. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Three politicians and two activists were detained without trial for two years after being arrested in 2001 following anti-government protests. In addition to other damages, the <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/5-win-unlawful-detention-case-awarded-rm4.06m-in-damages">court awarded</a> [<em>Malaysian Insider</em> report] 15,000 ringgit (USD $5,000) per person for each day spent in police custody. The government can appeal the verdict.

<p>The lower chamber of the <a href="http://www.parlimen.gov.my/">Malaysian Parliament</a> [official website, in Malay] in April <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/malaysia-lawmakers-approve-security-measures-law-replacing-sedition-law.php">approved a law</a> [JURIST report] aimed at replacing the ISA. Malaysian <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&amp;page=1926">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile] originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-to-repeal-strict-laws-allowing-detention-without-trial.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the government would repeal the ISA as well as the <a href="http://www.commonlii.org/my/legis/consol_act/ba19591972191/">Banishment Act of 1959</a> [text] in September 2011 and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malayasia-pm-initiates-repeal-of-security-laws.php">initiated the repeal</a> [JURIST report] a month later. Malaysia's internal security laws were heavily criticized in the past by various human rights organizations. In June 2010 the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-group-urges-malaysia-to-amend-internal-security-laws.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] Malaysia repeal or amend its security laws to conform to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. In 2009 the <a href="http://abolishisa.wordpress.com/">Abolish ISA Movement</a> [advocacy blog] initiated a demonstration against the law in which 10,000 to 20,000 people participated and resulted in 589 arrests. Of those arrested, 29 were <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/malaysia-court-charges-protesters-for.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] for their involvement in the rallies. The <a href="http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] had also <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/rights-group-urges-malaysia-to-revoke.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Malaysia to abolish the ISA in 2008. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, entitled "Abusive System: Criminal Justice in Gaza," claims that under Hamas rule, people in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5122404.stm">Gaza Strip</a> [BBC backgrounder] are subject to numerous rights violations including warrantless arrests and torture. The report includes a list of specific recommendations for Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, the Interior Ministry, and the Ministry of Justice that the organization hopes will resolve many of the abuses it believes are currently plaguing the region:<blockquote>Hamas should ... ensure that members of security services are held criminally liable for abuses against detainees, and it should sanction prosecutors and judges who turn a blind eye to violations, such as by issuing retroactive arrest warrants or accepting evidence that was credibly alleged to have been obtained under torture. Hamas authorities should strengthen oversight and complaints mechanisms intended to keep security services in check, including by allocating more resources to investigating and prosecuting security officers allegedly responsible for abuses.</blockquote>In an accompanying <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/110517">press release</a> [text], HRW deputy Middle East director Joe Stork claimed, "[a]fter five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees&#8217; rights, and grants impunity to abusive security services. Hamas should stop the kinds of abuses that Egyptians, Syrians, and others in the region have risked their lives to bring to an end."

<p>Accusations of human rights violations in the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/oPt.html">Palestinian territories</a> [UNICEF backgrounder], not just by Hamas but by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israel, continue to be of international concern. In August <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said that Israel should investigate the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/israel-urged-to-investigate-mistreatment-of-palestinian-detainees.php">alleged mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] of two Palestinian prisoners detained in Israel. In May the <a href="http://www.ichr.ps">Independent Commission for Human Rights</a> (ICHR) [advocacy website] accused the PA and Hamas of <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-claims-palestinian-authority-hamas-guilty-of-torture.php">committing torture</a> [JURIST report]. In January UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk alleged that Israeli authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-official-expresses-concern-over-violence-against-palestinians.php">continued to commit illegal acts that threaten the viability of the Palestinian state</a> [JURIST report] in the Palestinian territories, including the killing of four Palestinians by <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website]. In September 2010 a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm">UN panel of experts</a> [UN materials] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-panel-criticizes-israel-hamas-investigations-into-gaza-strip-conflict.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] investigations carried out by Israel and Hamas into the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">2008-2009 conflict in the Gaza Strip</a> [JURIST news archives], but praised the PA's report, which it said comported with international standards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Second Circuit's order allows certain provisions of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF], specifically Section 1021(b)(2), to remain in force pending appeal. This provision affirms the authority of the president under the <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/sjres23.enr.html">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) to detain indefinitely any "person who was a part of or substantially supported al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces." The US Department of Justice (DOJ) argued that Judge Katherine Forrest's ruling interpreted the AUMF unnecessarily and may have done "irreparable harm to national security and public interest by injecting added burdens and dangerous confusion into the conduct of military operations abroad during an active armed conflict." The appeals court panel based their decision on the fact the government (1) clarified the provision to protect overreach, (2) the statute does not affect existing rights of United States Citizens and (3) the district court injunction appears to be overbroad.

<p>The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/doj-requests-emergency-stay-to-continue-enforcement-of-indefinite-detention-law-dnp.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/433357-hedges-motion-to-stay-2nd-circuit.html">emergency stay pending appeal</a> [petition, PDF] in September. Forrest <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-blocks-portion-of-anti-terrorism-law.php">issued an injunction</a> against the law in May, and clarified in the following weeks that her injunction should be <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-clarifies-injunction-on-anti-terrorism-law--dnp.php">interpreted broadly</a> [JURIST reports]. Several civil rights groups have praised her decision and have circulated <a href="http://act.demandprogress.org/letter/ndaa_lawsuit_win/">petitions</a> [advocacy website] arguing that the government should not appeal the injunction. Lawyers for the government <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-prosecutors-appeal-injunction-on-indefinite-detention-law.php">filed their appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the Second Circuit in August. US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/obama-signs-controversial-defense-bill.php">signed the NDAA into law</a> [JURIST report] in December. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Representatives for the UN <a href=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] voiced their concern Tuesday over Iran's recent crackdown on activists speaking out within the nation. The OHCHR is most notably concerned by the September arrest of human rights lawyer Mohammad Ali Dadkhah. According to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12617&LangID=E">statement</a> [press release] by the OHCHR, Dadkhah has been sentenced to nine years in prison for "membership of an association seeking to overthrow the government and propaganda against the system." In addition to his prison sentence, Dadkhah has also received a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43188&Cr=iran&Cr1=#.UGxOspjA-8A">10-year ban</a> [UN News Centre report] on legal practice and teaching. Ali Akbar Javanfekr, who had been the press adviser to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10866448">President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [BBC profile], was also arrested last week for having "insulted" the Supreme Leader <a href="http://www.leader.ir/langs/en/">Sayyid Ali Khamenei</a> [official website]. Also last week, government forces shuttered an independent newspaper, the <em>Daily Shargh</em>, and arrested the newspapers director, Mehdi Rahmanian, for its publication of a cartoon that officials claimed "'insulted the values of the revolution." According to Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the OHCHR, "the arrests and harsh sentences imposed on such figures reflect a disturbing trend apparently aimed at curbing freedom of expression, opinion and association, which are guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a State party." Colville also noted the timing of this crackdown is particularly troubling in the buildup to next year's presidential election. 

<p>Accusations against Iran for engaging in politically motivated arrests are not new. Last month the daughter of Iran's former president, <a href="http://www.iranian.com/Features/2000/October/Faezeh/index.html">Faezah Hashemi</a> [<em>The Iranian</em> profile], was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/daughter-iran-ex-president-taken-into-custody-to-serve-6-month-sentence.php">detained</a> after being <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/daughter-of-former-iran-president-sentenced-to-six-months.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to six months for spreading propaganda. Faezah Hashemi is one of several opposition figures that have been detained and charged in connection with the wave of civil unrest following the disputed re-election of Ahmadinejad. In December Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/Iran-court-sentences-opposition-leader-to-8-years-in-prison.php">sentenced opposition figure</a> [JURIST report] and former Iranian foreign minister Ebrahim Yazdi to eight years in prison for attempting to act against national security. Yazdi was also banned from civic activities for five years in the closed-door trial reportedly held in early November. Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi said last year that approximately 100 people imprisoned for their participation in the massive 2009 presidential election protests have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/iran-election-protesters-released-from-prisons.php">pardoned and released</a> [JURIST report] by Iran's supreme leader <a href="http://www.leader.ir/langs/EN/index.php?p=bio/">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> [official profile]. In March 2011 Iranian opposition leaders <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8103851.stm">Mir-Hossein Mousavi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mir-Hossein+Mousavi">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/k/mehdi_karroubi/index.html">Mehdi Karroubi</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mehdi+Karroubi">news archive</a>] and their wives were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/iran-opposition-leaders-jailed-reports.php">arrested and jailed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

With the life sentence, the court also sentenced nine other officials to prison terms of varying length. The re-trial began in February when the Supreme Court of Appeals reversed a previous conviction reasoning that there were clerical errors and defendants did not receive a fair trial because of their representation by a single lawyer. During the re-trial, the life sentence of one police officer was converted to a sentence of two-and-a-half years. Two other police officers were sentenced to seven-and-a-half years and three prison guards to 12-and-a-half years. The verdicts are expected to be appealed in the near future. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/historic-verdict-finds-turkish-officials-caused-activist-s-death-custody-2012-10-02">welcomed the sentencing</a> [press release] as a "historic verdict."

<p>Following Ceber's death in 2008, the Istanbul 14th High Criminal Court in 2010 initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-praises-conviction-in-toture-case.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] several guards to life in prison. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/06/03/turkey-landmark-convictions-torture-case">reported</a> [press release] that it was the first time a Turkish court had convicted a senior prison official for the conduct of guards under his command. Nineteen defendants were convicted for their role in the activists' torture, including a prison doctor who was sentenced to more than three years for falsifying documents about the health of the inmates. Turkish Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkish-justice-minister-apologizes-for.php">apologized on behalf of the Turkish government</a> [JURIST report] and suspended the 19 defendants following Ceber's death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] noted in the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=s/2012/678">report</a> [materials] that the country is still subject to "setbacks linked to political instability, lack of respect for the rule of law and unmet social grievances." The report also recommended the extension of the mandate of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minustah/">UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti</a> (MINUSTAH) [official website]. Amunategui presented to the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] a consolidation plan established between the local government and MINUSTAH in order to decrease the UN's military presence in Haiti while gradually transferring the responsibility to the national police forces. The Special Representative also pointed out the need for a permanent electoral council which would lead to the election of government officials. 

<p>Haiti is still in the process of improving its rule of law. In June Haitian President Michel Joseph Martelly <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/haiti-adopts-constitutional-amendments.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] for amendments to the country's Constitution that will allow dual-citizens to vote and be appointed to administrative positions. Dual-citizens are still barred from running for key political offices, including offices of President, Prime Minister, Senator, and the lower house of Parliament. The US State Department in February dispatched a team of international law experts to Haiti to assess how to reinforce the Haitian judiciary's power and independence. Earlier that month UN independent expert Michel Forst proclaimed that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/haiti-rule-of-law-has-made-significant-progress-un-expert.php">rule of law is making significant progress in Haiti</a> [JURIST report]. Forst focused on the establishment of judicial offices and the adoption of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b36c0.html">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> [text, PDF]. In January a Haitian judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-judge-convicts-8-police-officers-for-post-earthquake-prison-shooting.php">convicted eight police officers</a> [JURIST report] of shooting and killing at least 10 prisoners following the January 2010 earthquake. In December 2011 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-groups-urge-probe-of-torture-and-killings-by-haiti-police.php">urged an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged torture and unlawful killings perpetrated by the Haitian National Police (HNP). In September of that year Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-urges-haiti-authorities-to-prosecute-former-haiti-president.php">called on Haitian authorities to prosecute Duvalier</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity. In July 2011 a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-urges-haiti-to-improve-rights-try-duvalier.php">requested that Haiti prosecute Duvalier</a> [JURIST report] and improve its human rights record.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result of the conviction, he received a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-sentences-former-congo-militia-leader-to-14-years.php">14-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] from the ICC. Lubanga's lawyers are <a href="http://www.starafrica.com/en/news/detail-news/view/congolese-warlord-appeals-international-255459.html">seeking</a> [AFP report] to have the conviction and the sentence replaced with an acquittal. Lubanga has <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/congo-ex-militia-leader-lubanga-pleads.php">maintained his innocence</a> [JURIST report] throughout the trial.

<p>The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/LubangaENG.pdf">Prosecutor v.

The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-concludes-case-in-trial-of.php">concluded its case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009 after presenting 22 weeks of testimony.

The law requires that the use of the pill, <a href = "http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111323.htm">RU-486</a> [FDA guidelines], conform with federal guidelines, which currently do not allow the pill to be used after seven weeks of pregnancy.

The Sixth Circuit was unanimous in affirming the lower court's judgment finding the law constitutional and rejecting the argument by <a href = "http://www.plannedparenthood.org/swoh/">Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio</a> [advocacy website] that the law was still vague and forced women to choose surgical abortions.

<p>Oklahoma has also <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">prohibited the use of RU-486</a> [JURIST report]. Last year the Ohio Senate <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would limit the availability of abortions after 20 weeks. <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports] have each passed legislation which restricts the abortion procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Although a federal district court denied her petition for <em>habeas corpus</em>, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the lower court and <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/05/23/07-56127.pdf">granted</a> [opinion, PDF] her petition. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the state trial court "cut some corners" to avoid a hung jury and lacked "good cause" to dismiss the juror. The state of California, however, argued Wednesday that there is a categorical rule that deference should be given to a state court to determine the merits of a federal claim, including one for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em>.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-597.pdf">Arkansas Game &#38; Fish Commission v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-aggravated-felony-for-immigration-purposes.php">report</a>] to determine whether recurring flooding of property caused by federal governmental actions constitutes a "taking" under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/category/keywords/takings_clause">Takings Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment05/">Fifth Amendment</a> [text], requiring the federal government to pay due compensation to owners of damaged property, if it is only temporary. The <a href="http://www.agfc.com/Pages/default.aspx">Arkansas Game &#38; Fish Commission</a> brought this action against the federal government, alleging that the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official websites] caused increased flooding on one of its properties, which in turn damaged timber. The commission claims the damaging of timber on its property constituted a taking for which it deserved compensation, and the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] agreed and awarded damages of more than $5.6 million. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Arkansas_Game__Fish_Commission_v_United_States_637_F3d_1366_Fed_C">overturned</a> [opinion] that ruling, saying that the flooding did not constitute a taking because it was only temporary and did not permanently take over the land. The commission argued to the Supreme Court that it should not matter whether the water remains on the land permanently, but that the government should compensate landowners whenever it releases water that causes a "physical invasion" of private property. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Montana's campaign finance law limits the individual contributions to gubernatorial and lieutenant governor candidates to $500 and contributions to candidates for other statewide offices to $250. Judge Charles Lovell held that the law unconstitutionally prevents both candidates and potential donors from being able to wage an effective political campaign:<blockquote>[T]he Court concludes that Montana's contribution limits in Montana Code Annotated Section 13-37-216 are unconstitutional under the First Amendment. ... The contribution limits prevent candidates from amassing the resources necessary for effective campaign advocacy. ... The defendants are therefore permanently enjoined from enforcing these limits.</blockquote>Montana <a href="https://doj.mt.gov/our-attorney-general/">Attorney General Steve Bullock</a> plans to appeal the decision to the <a href="https://doj.mt.gov/our-attorney-general/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official websites].

Iraq's central criminal court <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/iraqi-officials-car-bomb-kills-baghdad-17393628#.UG2ixhhxs7A">convicted</a> [AP report] Omar Rashad Khalil following a confession he made in which he admitted to receiving money from a Syrian man in the UAE to finance terrorist attacks. The <a href="http://www.moi.gov.iq/">Iraqi Ministry of the Interior</a> [official website, in Arabic] released excerpts of Khalil's confession. Khalil, a 53-year-old architect, was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFBRE8930XU20121004">arrested in 2010</a> [Reuters report] and charged with helping finance and execute terrorist operations in Iraq.

This is the third corruption case pending against Arroyo, who <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/philippines-court-grants-bail-to-former-president.php">made bail in July</a> [JURIST report] after eight months of detention in an army hospital. This most recent case against Arroyo accuses her of misusing over $8 million in state lottery funds while in office. Other corruption cases accuse her of election fraud and accepting bribes. Arroyo has maintained her innocence in all cases, suggesting the charges are politically motivated. Lawyers for Arroyo told the court on Thursday that the newest <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/OREUG/86053d8662944f7698388c63189f97c6/Article_2012-10-04-Philippines-Arroyo/id-974cdd013eac4fa9b2ea14f370527e26">charges were unsupported</a> [AP report] and that the government's witnesses do not have first-hand knowledge of the events. The court has agreed to review the charges.

<p>Former president Arroyo has been a target of anti-corruption efforts by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">President Benigno Aquino</a> [BBC profile]. Arroyo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-arrested-on-fraud-corruption-charges.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in November on fraud and corruption charges in the hospital before she was able to leave the country to seek medical treatment. In April Arroyo and her husband Jose Miguel <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/philippines-ex-president-pleads-not-guilty-to-corruption-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to corruption charges before a special anti-graft court in the Philippines. The non-guilty plea came a month after a Philippines court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-ex-presidents-husband.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] against Jose on bribery charges. He was accused of accepting bribes to support the $329-million national broadband network deal with ZTE Corporation. Arroyo faced the same charges in December when the country's authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/philippines-ex-president-faces-new-charges.php">filed a second criminal complaint</a> [JURIST report] against her alleging that she approved a $329-million national broadband network deal with the Chinese company in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Dragan Neskovic and Zoran Ilic were charged with crimes against humanity for their role in the massacre at Srebrenica and other war crimes. In a press release, the court announced that the two men were acquitted because "it was not proven that they committed the crime they were charged with." Ilic was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/bosnia-police-arrest-3-suspected-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 with two other police officers for their alleged involvement in the massacre. While the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) has jurisdiction over high-level war crimes allegations, such as those against Bosnian Serb wartime leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/703/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">news archive</a>] and General <a href="http://www.icty.org/cases/party/704/4">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY materials], the BiH courts have been able to try lower-level suspects.

<p>BiH has been continuously prosecuting, convicting and sentencing those responsible for the killing during the massacre, and even those who left the country are being brought back to face charges. In June the country's war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bosnia-court-sentences-former-soldiers-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/index.php?opcija=predmeti&id=326&jezik=h">four former Bosnian Serb soldiers</a> [case materials, in Croatian] for their involvement in the 1995 massacre. In May US resident Dejan Radojkovic was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/us-resident-deported-to-bosnia-to-face-war-crimes-charges.php">deported</a> [JURIST report] to BiH to stand trial before the country's court for his actions as a police commander in Srebrenica during the 1995 massacre. He was arrested in 2009 after it was revealed that he did not disclose his involvement in the conflict and his appeal was rejected in February. He was the second to be deported after his commanding officer, Nedjo Ikonic, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-police.php">deported in 2010</a> [JURIST report]. A day earlier, the war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/two-bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-prison-for-roles-in-srebenica-massacre.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Dusko Jevic and Mendeljev Djuric for taking part in the killing of 1,000 Muslim men during the massacre after it found that the two former Bosnian Serb police officers were guilty of aiding and abetting genocide. They had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/three-former-bosnian-serb-police.php">indicted</a> on genocide charges in January 2010 after being <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/bosnia-police-arrest-3-suspected-in.php">arrested</a> [JURIST reports] in October 2009. In January the court also <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bosnia-war-crimes-court-upholds-31-year-sentence-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">upheld</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-31-years-for.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] and 31-year sentence of Radomir Vukovic for his part in the 1995 massacre.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN rights chief urges Serbia to allow gay pride parade</title>

The pride parade, which was scheduled to be held this Saturday in Belgrade, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/us-serbia-parade-idUSBRE8921C020121003">canceled</a> [Reuters report] by the <a href="www.mup.gov.rs/cms_eng/home.nsf/index-eng.html">Serbian Ministry of Interior</a> [official website] for security reasons. A similar cancellation occurred last year after the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/cops-protesters-clash-belgrade-gay-pride-parade/story?id=11845840">Belgrade parade of 2010</a> [<em>ABC News</em> report] amounted to violent attacks, vandalism, and wounded police officers and civilians. Pillay, however, parried the security argument by reasoning that banning peaceful assembly altogether further violates human rights. "States should confront prejudice, not submit to it," said the High Commissioner, who relied on the fundamental freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly to make her case to the Serbian government. Pillay also acknowledged Serbia's progress in the protection of human rights since 2008, and deemed the Belgrade parade another opportunity for the country to reaffirm its commitment to human rights. Outside of the parade, Serbia has on previous occasions <a href="http://www.srbija.gov.rs/vesti/vest.php?id=77508">celebrated gay rights</a> [press release], most notably on International Gay Pride Day.

<p>Serbia is one of several countries allegedly restraining freedom of expression in light of a restrictive approach to gay pride parades. In August a city court in Moscow <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/moscow-court-upholds-100-year-city-ban-on-gay-pride-marches.php">refused to overturn</a> [JURIST report] the municipal government's ban on gay pride marches for the next century. Specifically, the court affirmed the Moscow municipal government ruling that any public gatherings classified as gay pride marches are prohibited from March 2012 until May 2112. In June <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-calls-on-bulgaria-to-denounce-anti-gay-violence.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Bulgarian Justice Minister Diana Kovacheva urging her to denounce calls to violence by anti-gay groups in anticipation of a gay pride parade in Sofia, Bulgaria, on June 30. In May 2010 a court in Lithuania <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/lithuania-court-overturns-gay-pride-parade-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the nation's first gay pride parade could proceed as scheduled, overturning a lower court's decision to ban it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although Missouri <a href="http://ltgov.mo.gov/">Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder</a> [official website] and six other citizens alleged that the PPACA violates provisions of both the US and Missouri constitutions, the Eighth Circuit emphasized that even a finding of proper standing would result in dismissing the case based on the US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">National Federal of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">report</a>] in June. The court here, however, concluded that Kinder lacked standing "because he sued in his individual capacity, and he could not allege injury based on his performance of duties as an officer of the State of Missouri," thus negating the need to even discuss the Supreme Court decision. The Eighth Circuit's ruling affirms a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] made in April 2011 by the <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a> [official website] on the same grounds. 

<p>In July the <a href="http://www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-health-care-contraception-provision.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by seven state attorneys general challenging the PPACA's health care mandates, particularly those that require all employer health care plans, including those of religious institutions, to cover contraception. In June the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that declared the PPACA constitutional centered on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">"individual mandate" provision</a> [text] of the act, which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, or be subject to a fee equal to either a percent of that individual's income or flat rate of $695. In his opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts held that individual mandate is not a requirement that Americans buy insurance, since individuals who choose to pay the flat-rate fee are in full compliance with the law. The Court's decision resolved four consolidated cases <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">accepted by the court</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Authors and publishers have alleged that Google was illegally profiting off of their works by scanning more than <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-books-20121005,0,6260341.story">20 million books</a> [AP report]. One particularly contentious issue was that Google would include books in its book-scanning initiative unless an author or publisher affirmatively objected to its inclusion in the project. Therefore, an author's works could be published without the author's knowledge since Google did not obtain permission from either authors or publishers. This settlement does not require court approval since the only parties involved in the settlement are parties to the litigation. There is still an outstanding lawsuit between various authors and Google, leaving the future of Google's book-scanning initiative uncertain.

<p>Last month the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/second-circuit-suspends-google-books-case-pending-appeal-of-class-action-status.php">suspended litigation</a> [JURIST report] between the <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/">Authors Guild</a> [advocacy website] and Google pending an appeal of a May ruling allowing a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-allows-google-books-class-action-to-proceed.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over Google's book-scanning initiative. Both sides have tried to resolve the dispute without litigation, but their <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-rejects-google-books-settlement.php">settlement agreement was rejected</a> [JURIST report] by Circuit Judge Denny Chin in March 2011. The agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/google-agrees-to-settle-two-copyright.php">reached in 2008</a> between Google and plaintiffs including the Guild, who <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/writers-group-sues-google-for.php">brought the copyright suit</a> [JURIST reports] in 2005. </p>]]></content:encoded>

AI contends that both men should be released immediately unless they are charged with an internationally recognized offense. A Deputy Director for Amnesty International states that "the families of these men have a right to know what has happened to them. If they are held, they should be released immediately and unconditionally unless they are charged with an internationally recognisable offence." Khalil Ma'touq and his friend were last seen on Tuesday morning, leaving their home in Damascus for work. The two men both had to pass through numerous government checkpoints on their way to work, but neither of them made it into work that day. Now, both the men's cell phones are not working. Ma'touq is part of Syria's Christian minority and has been working as a human rights lawyer for several years, defending individuals before the State's Security Court. 

<p>Last month the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-body-extends-mission-of-independent-panel-in-syra.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] extending the mission of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry (COI) in Syria. The panel of independent experts is charged with investigating the human rights situation in the country amidst the prolonged and violent conflict between government and opposition forces. The COI last week testified before the Human Rights Council that human rights violations in Syria were <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-investigators-human-rights-violations-in-syria-increasing.php">increasing in severity and number</a> [JURIST report]. Chair of the COI Paulo Pinheiro stated that both sides of the Syrian conflict are committing war crimes and that government forces are committing crimes against humanity. He said that the government was using regular bombing of residential neighborhoods via both artillery shelling and airstrikes and mechanized infantry to clear out anti-government groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The TPP Act sets criminal and civil penalties for failure to conform to the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011L02644">Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011</a> [materials], which impose significant restrictions on the color, shape, finish and other aesthetic details of retail packaging for tobacco products and mandate specific health warnings be printed on each pack. <a href="http://www.bat.com/">British American Tobacco</a>, <a href="http://www.imperial-tobacco.com/index.asp?page=638">Imperial Tobacco Australia Limited, <a href="http://www.pmi.com/eng/pages/homepage.aspx">Philip Morris</a> and <a href="http://www.jti.com/">Japan Tobacco International</a> [corporate websites] argued that the TPP Act would amount to an unconstitutional acquisition of the tobacco giants' intellectual property rights and goodwill thereof. The court disagreed:<blockquote>By prescribing what can and cannot appear on retail packaging the TPP Act affects that packaging and those who produce and sell the tobacco products. But to characterise this effect as "control" diverts attention from the fundamental question: does the TPP Act give the Commonwealth a legal interest in the packaging or create a legal relation between the Commonwealth and the packaging that the law describes as "property"? Compliance with the TPP Act creates no proprietary interest ... The TPP Act is not a law by which the Commonwealth acquires any "interest in property, however slight or insubstantial it may be" ... The arguments advanced by the tobacco companies are answered by the logically anterior conclusion that the TPP Act effects no acquisition of property.</blockquote>The regulations specifically dictate that cigarette packs have, among other requirements, largely plain outer surfaces the green-brown "colour known as Pantone 448C" and that the brand or business name be printed in Lucida Sans typeface "no larger than 14 points in size" and "in the colour known as Pantone Cool Gray 2C." Trademarks appearing on the packaging must conform to specific regulations.

<p>Tobacco regulations have long been a contentious subject. Also in August the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that tobacco companies do not need to print graphic warnings of the dangers of smoking on cigarette packages. In July the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-appeals-court-blocks-law-requiring-graphic-tobacco-warnings-in-stores.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring stores todisplay graphic anti-tobacco adswhere tobacco products are sold. In March the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cigarette+label">graphic cigarette label warnings</a> [JURIST news archive] are constitutional. The court decided unanimously that the portions of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text] designed to limit the tobacco industry's ability to advertise to children, including a ban on distributing clothing and goods with logos or brand names, as well as sponsorship of cultural, athletic and social events requiring cigarette packaging and advertisements, is a valid restriction of commercial speech. President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the FSPTCA into law in 2009, granting the FDA certain authority to regulate manufactured tobacco products.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Several rights groups had filed suit to stop the purging process in Florida, arguing that it violated regulations in the <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [text] and the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/workflow_staging/Page/27.PDF">National Voter Registration Act</a> (NVRA) [text, PDF]. The NVRA contains a provision that plaintiffs argued bars Florida from purging its rolls 90 days before the primary election. In his decision, Judge William Zloch rejected the argument: <blockquote>Certainly, the NVRA does not require the State to idle on the sidelines until a non-citizen violates the law before the State can act. And surely the NVRA does not require a state to wait until after that critical juncture&#8212;when the vote has been cast and the harm has been fully realized&#8212;to address what it views as nothing short of "voter fraud" ... The Court finds that the Secretary has a compelling interest in ensuring that the voting rights of citizens are not diluted by the casting of votes by non-citizens.</blockquote> Florida has cut back significantly the number of registered voters it seeks to remove from the rolls. The state had originally compiled a list of more than 2,600 names of potentially ineligible voters. The revised list of 180 names was released last month after Florida <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/florida-granted-access-to-federal-immigration-database-in-effort-to-purge-state-voter-rolls.php">gained access</a> [JURIST report] to a federal immigration database. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a contentious issue in the US, particularly in the run-up to the November presidential election. A judge for the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-blocks-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday preventing Pennsylvania's voter identification law from taking effect for the upcoming presidential election. Also on Tuesday, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood announced that the state's voter ID law will <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/mississippi-voter-id-law-delayed-pending-federal-review.php">not take effect</a> [JURIST report]] before the November 6 election.There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">32 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, but the issue remains controversial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Richard McCombe ruled that the three Kenyans could <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/05/mau-mau-veterans-win-torture-case">claim damages against the British government</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] for the harm they sustained at the hands of their captors during the <a href="http://www.leighday.co.uk/LeighDay/media/LeighDay/documents/Press-Pack-Historical-Background-to-the-Mau-Mau-Claims_1.doc">Mau Mau uprising</a> [Leigh Day &#38; Co. backgrounder] in the days of the British Empire. The three claimants, who were not in court to hear the ruling, seek apologies from the British government and reparations in the form of welfare benefit funding for other Kenyan victims of colonial torture.

<p>The three Kenyans <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/05/us-britain-kenya-idUSBRE8940G520121005">suffered horrific ordeals</a> [Reuters report]. Paulo Nzili, 85, was captured on his way home from defecting from the Mau Mau and castrated by in British custody. Wambugu Wa Nyingi, 84, was never a member of Mau Mau but spent nine years in detention without charge, suffering severe beatings that often killed his fellow detainees. Jane Muthoni Mara, 73, was sexually abused and raped while in detention when she was only about 15 years old. There had also been a fourth claimant, Susan Ciong'ombe Ngondi, but she died two years ago at the age of 71.</p>

<p>The government had argued that too much time had passed for there to be a fair trial, but in July 2011 McCombe <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/uk-court-allows-kenya-citizens-to-sue-uk-government-for-torture.php">rejected the contention</a> [JURIST report] that the alleged abuses occurred too long ago and that all liability of the colonial administration passed to the Kenyan government upon gaining independence in 1963. The Kenyans first  <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/former-kenya-rebels-sue-uk-over.php">sued the British government</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to bring to court their allegations that they were abused in British Colonial prison camps. The Mau Mau rebellion was led by members of the largely impoverished <a href="http://www.africaguide.com/culture/tribes/kikuyu.htm">Kikuyu tribe</a> [<em>Africa Guide</em> backgrounder] and lasted from 1952-1960. The uprising was notorious for atrocities committed by both the rebels and British colonial forces. Official casualty figures eventually set the number of European deaths at 32 and the number of Kenyans killed at just over 11,000. Approximately <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixsxieoFNBhQOdW8t81fLNsQmP8g?docId=4e9385bdfefe47258debfdd7b592725f">90,000 Kenyans were executed, tortured or maimed during the crackdown</a> [AP report] against the Mau Mau, according to the <a href="http://www.khrc.or.ke/">Kenya Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's decision comes a week after the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] gave its <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/europe-rights-court-approves-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">final approval</a> of the extradition, which it had <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/europe-rights-court-allows-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">initially approved</a> [JURIST reportS] in April. Egyptian-born Muslim cleric <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3752517.stm">Abu Hamza al-Masri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abu+Hamza+al-Masri">news archive</a>] and four other suspects <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/terror-suspect-asks-europe-rights-court-to-block-extradition-to-us.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] that ruling in July, but the ECHR declined to revisit their arguments. In its decision, the court criticized the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17662054">extensive time spent litigating the extradition</a> [BBC report]. In addition to al-Masri, British citizens Syed Talha Ahsan and <a href="http://www.freebabarahmad.com/">Babar Ahmad</a> [advocacy website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4441680.stm">profile</a>] and Saudi-born Khaled Al-Fawwaz are now slated to be extradited. All five men are wanted in the US on terrorism charges and will face imprisonment without parole at <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/flm/">ADX Florence</a> [BOP backgrounder], a super-maximum security prison in Colorado. It has not been announced when the group will be extradited nor when they will be tried in the US. 

<p>The ECHR's decision in April marked a change in position for the court from its position two years ago, when it <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/europe-rights-court-blocks-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">stayed the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of four of the terrorism suspects to the US, holding that potential punishment could violate <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html#C.Art3">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text] provisions on the prohibition of torture and inhumane or degrading treatment. The UK High Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/uk-court-approves-extradition-of.php">approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of Aswat and Ahmad to the US in 2006. Aswat is wanted in the US on suspicion of setting up a terrorist training camp and Ahmad is wanted for conspiring to kill Americans and running a website used to fund terrorists and recruit al Qaeda members. The extraditions were approved only after the US offered assurances that it would not seek the death penalty, try the suspects before military tribunals or declare them enemy combatants. A British court <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/uk-court-approves-extradition-of-jailed.php">approved the extradition</a> [JURIST report] of al-Masri in 2007. Hamza, who is currently <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/breaking-news-muslim-cleric-abu-hamza.php">serving a seven-year sentence in the UK</a> [JURIST report] for urging his followers to kill Jews and other non-Muslims, faces US charges of attempting to establish terrorist training camps in Oregon, conspiring to take hostages in Yemen, and helping terror training in Afghanistan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The OHCHR said that the bill would be open to abuse and that it violates human rights and Ukraine's commitments to anti-discrimination and the protection of minority rights. In its current draft form, the bill authorizes fines and prison sentences of up to five years for "promotion of homosexuality." Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights Valeria Lutkovska <a href="http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/120042/">criticized</a> [Interfax report] the bill for failing to define what exactly "promotion of homosexuality" entails. The bill would also include a criminal provision for importing, producing or distributing documents that both promote homosexuality and, in some way, promote religious intolerance, national intolerance, racism or discrimination, among other offenses.

<p>The Ukrainian parliament gave the bill <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/ukraine-lawmakers-give-preliminary-approval-to-gay-propaganda-ban.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week. The draft law is modeled off of a <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/russia-city-law-bans-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">law in St. Petersburg, Russia</a> [JURIST report] that imposes fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality, including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. The <a href = "/paperchase/2012/05/russia-gay-activist-first-to-be-convicted-under-controversial-city-ordinance.php">first conviction</a> [JURIST report] under the law occurred in April, when a gay rights activist was fined for picketing in front of city hall with a sign that said "homosexuality is not perversion." LGBT rights activists continue to <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/russia-gay-rights-activist-challenges-homosexual-propaganda-law.php">challenge the law</a> [JURIST report]. The Russian parliament <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/russia-lawmakers-introduce-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced a similar law</a> [JURIST report] shortly after the St. Petersburg law passed, but it has yet to pass.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This was the <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/10/german-court-holds-that-android-does.html">fourth decision</a> [FOSS Patents report] in a suit between Motorola and Microsoft to be issued this year, all of which were countersuits by Microsoft against claims by Motorola. All of the prior decisions had come down in Microsoft's favor up to this point. The patent at issue, <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&date=20060823&DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&locale=en_EP&CC=EP&NR=1233343B1&KC=B1&ND=4">EP1233343</a> [text], is for technology that allows applications to work with <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/08/microsoft-keeps-pushing-for-third.html">different mobile communication hardware and cellular networks</a> [FOSS Patents report]. This allows the same application to work with different mobile phones. The court found that Motorola did not infringe Microsoft's patent. Microsoft is expected to appeal the ruling.

<p>Motorola has been very active in German courts both seeking to protect and asserting its intellectual property. In September <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] won an injunction against Motorlola for infringing <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/apple-wins-injunction-against-motorola-in-germany-court.php">EP2126788</a> [JURIST report] which covered "rubber-banding" technology in scrolling lists. In July a German court granted an injunction for Microsoft  against Motorola in a patent infringement case over <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-court-issues-injunction-against-motorola.php">EP0618540</a> [JURIST report] which involved technology relating to common names for long and short file allocation tables. Also in July a German court dismissed a patent infringement suit by Microsoft over <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-court-rejects-microsofts-case-against-motorola.php">EP1304891</a> [JURIST report] which monitors different functions on a smartphone and provides such information to other applications utilizing them. Another case that was brought by Microsoft against Motorola Mobility involving a patent on system input methods is postponed to September 20. In February Apple sued Motorola in the <a href="http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of California</a> [official website] seeking an <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/apple-sues-motorola-in-federal-court-over-patent-claims-in-germany.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] to stop Motorola from bringing patent claims against Apple in Germany, alleging that the German suit violates a licensing agreement between Motorola and Qualcomm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge David Briones sentenced former EPISD superintendent Lorenzo Garcia to 42 months in prison and ordered Garcia to pay $236,500 in restitution and fines. Garcia pleaded guilty in June to two counts of fraud for <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/superintendent-sentenced-test-scandal-17402335#.UHA6Ahhxs7A">conspiring to inflate the district's standardized test scores</a> [AP report] by excluding hundreds of high school sophomores from taking the tests. Several EPISD employees <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_21711101/sentence-disappoints-teachers-schemes-victims">expressed dissatisfaction with Garcia's sentence</a> [<em>El Paso Times</em> report], saying the court should have given him a harsher sentence for defrauding the state and depriving students of educational opportunities. Six other people allegedly helped Garcia organize the testing scheme.

<p>The <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_21139180/storify-episd-test-taking-scandal-scandal-timeline?source=pkg">EPISD cheating scandal</a> [<em>El Paso Times</em> backgrounder] has engendered a great deal of legal controversy in recent years. Earlier this week former Texas state senator <a href="http://shapleigh.org/">Eliot Shapleigh</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_21684921/shapleigh-garc-deserves-harsh-sentence?source=pkg">argued</a> [<em>El Paso Times</em> report] that Garcia should receive a harsher prison sentence than 42 months. In June it was revealed that Garcia <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_20875717/episd-garcia-got-54-000-bonuses-from-test-fixing?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com">received $54,000 in bonuses </a>[<em>El Paso Times</em> report] for inflating the test scores of the EPISD.

Paolo Gabriele was convicted on charges of theft for <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/10/201210610269208323.html">stealing confidential papers from the Vatican</a> [Al Jazeera report], photocopying them and passing them on to a journalist who <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/italian-journalist-publishes-book-of-vatican-leaks/">wrote a book</a> [Catholic News Agency backgrounder] alleging corruption and scandals at the Vatican. Presiding judge Giuseppe Dalla Torre originally sentenced Gabriele to three years in prison but <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/06/world/europe/vatican-leaks-trial/index.html">reduced the sentence to eighteen months</a> [CNN report] based on Gabriele's lack of a past criminal record and the fact that he admitted to betraying the Pope's trust. It remains unclear whether or not Gabriele's sentence will be suspended or whether the Pope will pardon him. Gabriele's attorney indicated that Gabriele would serve the sentence on house arrest while he awaits a papal pardon.

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vatican">Vatican</a> [JURIST news archive] has been under international legal scrutiny recently. In August a federal judge in Oregon <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-rules-priests-not-vatican-employees-in-sex-abuse-case.php">ruled that priests are not employees</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm">Holy See</a> [official website], the ecclesiastical, governmental and administrative capital of the Roman Catholic Church, and that the Vatican was thus not liable for individual acts of child molestation by priests. In February the sex crimes prosecutor for the Vatican <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/vatican-prosecutor-says-bishops-must-uphold-laws-to-protect-victims-of-sexual-abuse.php">warned bishops</a> [JURIST report] that they must follow rules in place for protecting victims of sexual abuse in the church or they risk being sanctioned. In September 2011 the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-files-icc-complaint-against-vatican-over-clergy-abuse.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] against Vatican officials, including Pope Benedict XVI, for systematic sexual abuse and subsequent concealment of over 10,000 incidents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A registered sex offender filed a lawsuit in the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of California</a> [official website] last week challenging ordinances in four Orange County cities that ban registered sex offenders from city-owned parks, campgrounds and other recreational areas where children may gather. The city ordinances were all modeled after a 2011 <a href="http://www.orangecountyda.com/home/index.asp?page=8&recordid=2280&returnurl=index.asp%3Fpage%3D8%26pagenumber%3D3%26pagesize%3D300%26deptid%3D%26archive%3D0%26sl_month%3D12">Orange County ordinance</a> [press release] that prohibits registered sex offenders from entering any county-owned parks or recreational areas. The plaintiff is an Orange County resident who alleges that the laws violate his <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First</a>, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] rights by denying him freedom to assemble peacefully and by taking away his rights without due process of the law. He also alleges that the ban amounts to an unconstitutional additional punishment for his crime, as he has already served the full sentence under his conviction of fifteen years ago. The cities being sued are Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Lake Forest. The chief of staff of the Orange County District Attorney's office <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-sex-offender-suit-20121006,0,4923324.story">defended</a> [LA Times report] the city ordinances, stating that the office will work with the cities' attorneys to fight the lawsuit and noting that fourteen Orange County cities have adopted sex offender rules on recommendation by the district attorney. The unnamed plaintiff reportedly is married and has children.

<p>The rights of convicted sex offenders has been the subject of many constitutional-based lawsuits. In January the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-on-sex-offender-registration-act.php">ruled 7-2</a> [JURIST report] that people who were convicted of sex offenses before the enactment of the federal <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/pdfs/final_sornaguidelines.pdf">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act</a> [final guidelines, PDF] did not have to register under the act until the attorney general validly specified that the provisions applied to them. A few days earlier, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-new-mexico-sex-offender-library-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a city ordinance that banned sex offenders from libraries in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Last year the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/affiliate/louisiana">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-seeks-to-block-louisiana-sex-offender-internet-use-law.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] a Louisiana law that limited Internet use for registered sex offenders. In 2010, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-appeals-court-upholds-indefinite-detention-of-mentally-ill-sex-offenders.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] indefinite detention of mentally ill sex offenders as constitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During the hearing judge Neil Wake <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Judge-considers-Arizona-law-on-Planned-Parenthood-3923817.php">questioned state attorneys</a> [AP report] regarding possible harm that could result from letting the law take effect before a trial, and indicated that he saw potential for "great harm" to women's health. The state argued that the law should take effect because it reflects the "will of the taxpayers" and legislators, while opponents of the law argued that it would cause negative effects to women who would be forced to abruptly switch doctors. Other issues to be decided after the hearing are whether PPA and other affected facilities have standing to challenge the law's constitutionality or if the challenge would have to come from the federal government, and whether or not the law should be allowed to take effect pending a trial challenging its constitutionality. Wake did not yet make a ruling on any of the issues so far presented.

<p>Arizona is currently facing multiple lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of recently passed abortion restrictions. Last month a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-enjoins-arizona-abortion-law.php">issued an emergency injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Arizona law that prohibits abortions after 20 weeks into a pregnancy except for in medical emergencies, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-challenge-arizona-abortion-law.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> and the <a href="http://acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy websites] in July. PPA also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/planned-parenthood-arizona-sues-state-officials-to-block-new-law-restricting-funding.php">filed its suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the funding law in July, claiming the law violates federal laws regarding Medicaid patients' rights by restricting their rights to choose physicians. The law restricting funding to abortion clinics was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/05/us-usa-abortion-arizona-idUSBRE84402Y20120505">signed by Governor Jan Brewer in May</a> [Reuters report], while the law banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/arizona-governor-signs-bill-to-ban-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed in April</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

On June 29, the World Bank <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/06/29/world-bank-statement-padma-bridge">announced</a> [press release] that, based partly on ACC findings, it had reason to believe there was a conspiracy among many of the leaders of the project, including Bangladeshi government officials. In response, it canceled the $1.2 billion line of credit for the project. However, on September 20, the World Bank <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/09/20/world-bank-statement-padma-bridge-sept-20-2012">decided to consider resuming the project</a> [press release] in light of Bangladesh's agreement to fulfill certain requirements, which were announced Friday:<blockquote><ul><li>to place all public officials suspected of involvement in the corruption scheme on leave from government employment until an investigation is complete</li></ul>
<ul><li>to appoint a special inquiry and prosecution team within the ACC to handle the investigation</li></ul>
<ul><li>to grant access to all investigative information to an external panel of internationally recognized experts who will advise the Bank and co-financiers on the credibility of the government's investigations</li></ul>
<ul><li>and to accept an alternative project implementation arrangement which gave co-financiers greater oversight over procurement processes</li></ul></blockquote>The External Panel of International Experts the World Bank will review the ACC's findings and whether or not the project has complied with the above requirements. Also appointed to the panel was Timothy Tong, former commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Richard Alderman, former director of the UK Serious Fraud Office. If the World Bank receives a positive report from the panel, it will resume financing the project.

<p>Moreno-Ocampo's nine-year term to the ICC recently ended, and in June, Gambian war crimes lawyer <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/TheProsecutor2012.htm">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fatou-bensouda-sworn-in-as-icc-prosecutor.php">sworn in</a> [JURIST report] to succeed him.

The ruling denied a motion filed by her parents seeking to continue the use of breathing tubes. At issue was the determination of whether she is capable of making decisions about her own care. After being paralyzed, Lee is only capable of communicating through blinking or mouthing words. The court's ruling determines that she is mentally capable of making decisions. While the original conflict began when Lee expressed her wish to be taken off life support, Lee recently <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/07/sungeun-grace-lee-terminally-ill-new-york-city-decides-to-stay-on-respirator_n_1946263.html">decided to remain on the respirator</a> [AP report].

In 2009 the Italian president <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-president-blocks-measure-to-stop.php">refused to sign an Italian government decree</a> [JURIST report] that would stop the euthanasia of comatose women because it would violate the separation of power overturning a previous court ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prince Taylor is accused of interfering with four prosecution witnesses who testified in the Charles Taylor trial and interfering with a fifth person who was about to give evidence in contempt proceedings. He was taken into custody in Bo, Sierra Leone, by Sierra Leone law enforcement officers, on the basis of a warrant issued by the SCSL. Prince Taylor's indictment indicates he is facing nine counts of contempt: four alleging he offered to bribe a witness to recent testimony, four he otherwise interfered with a witness to recant testimony and single count that he interfered with a witness about to give evidence in proceedings before a chamber by "instructing and otherwise persuading Eric Senessie to give false information to the Independent Counsel appointed by the Registrar on the order of Trial Chamber II."

<p>At the end of September the SCSL found three members of Sierra Leone's former Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-convicts-three-of-contempt.php">guilty of contempt</a> [JURIST report]. With the recent <a href = "/paperchase/2012/05/charles-taylor-sentenced-to-50-years-for-war-crimes.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Charles Taylor, the SCSL has largely fulfilled its mission and will take steps to shut down. In November 2009, the SCSL <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-hands.php">handed over its detention facility</a> [JURIST report] to the Sierra Leone Prison Service in a monumental step towards the court's resolution. The month before, eight men judged guilty of war crimes by the court were <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-transfers.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to Rwanda to serve out their terms. The SCSL was created in a joint endeavor by the government of Sierra Leone and the UN to provide a forum to try those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law, committed in Sierra Leone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

"Rwanda: Shrouded in Secrecy: Illegal Detention and Torture by Military Intelligence" documents 45 cases of unlawful detention and 18 allegations of torture or ill-treatment over two years at Camp Kami military camp and in safe houses in the capital city of Kigali. Included are detailed accounts of serious beatings, electric shocks and sensory deprivation to force confessions during interrogations. The report does note the government's progress over the last decade in improving prison conditions under the authority of the Rwanda Correctional Service but points out that such progress is undermined by the parallel detention system run by the military and points to the military intelligence department known as J2 for most of the forced disappearances and maltreatment of detainees. Some detainees reported being tortured and coerced to confess to charges of threatening national security and claimed that judges have asked them to prove torture in court instead of complying with international law and ordering that such allegations be investigated. AI called on the Rwandan government to ensure that civilians are only detained in official prison facilities and that all detainees, including those held by the military, receive medical care and access to counsel while in detention. The report further urges the government to amend certain provisions of its internal criminal code and to ratify and adopt various international treaties and protocols on human rights abuses and calls on foreign governments to suspend any financial support to institutions or security forces involved in human rights violations.

<p>In August the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> [official website] received <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-urged-to-investigate-rwanda-president-for-arming-drc-rebels.php">requests to investigate</a> [JURIST report] Rwandan <a href="http://www.presidency.gov.rw/presidents-profile">President Paul Kagame</a> [official profile] for backing armed rebels in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13283212">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) [BBC backgrounder]. Rwandan and Congolese advocacy groups opposed to Kagame's rule have alleged that the Rwandan leader is guilty of war crimes for helping to create and arm rebel groups in eastern DRC including M23, which has been conducting a mutiny in North Kivu Province under the leadership of a particularly notorious group of human rights violators. The calls for an ICC investigation follow the release of a UN report detailing investigations since late 2011 that <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-releases-leaked-report-on-rwanda-aid-to-drc-armed-forces.php">revealed substantial evidence</a> [JURIST report] that the Rwandan government helped create the rebel groups and supplied them with weapons, armor and recruits, including children. In June UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] estimated that the armed conflict between the DRC government and the M23 movement has <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/conflict-in-drc-threatens-civilians-un-rights-chief.php">displaced around 218,000 people</a> [JURIST report] from their homes since April, specifically mentioning five M23 leaders and describing them as the "worst perpetrators of human rights violations in the DRC, or in the world for that matter."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Nasheed has twice <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/maldives-police-arrest-ex-president-after-he-failed-to-appear-before-court/2012/10/08/dbb89148-111f-11e2-9a39-1f5a7f6fe945_story.html">failed to appear in court</a> [AP report] to face abuse of power charges. Last Monday a three-judge panel was forced to postpone the first day of Nashed's trial after he <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/maldives-ex-president-violates-travel-ban-fails-to-appear-in-court.php">violated his travel ban</a> [JURIST report], leaving Male in a boat that day in order to campaign in the Maldives' southern islands. A week earlier the Hulhumale Magistrate Court had issued an order <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/maldives-court-restricts-ex-president-to-capital.php">prohibiting Nasheed from leaving the city</a> [JURIST report] without official permission. Nasheed's supporters have claimed that the move was politically motivated to limit the ex-president's ability to campaign for the election scheduled for November 2013. He was arrested by armed police in riot gear on Fares-Mathoda island in the Gaaf Dhaal atoll, almost 275 miles from the capital, and authorities have stated that he will appear in court within a day. The charges against Nasheed stem from the questioned legality of his <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">unilateral order to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed on corruption charges in January, when Nasheed was still president.

<p>The arrest of the chief justice and the resulting unrest in Maldives sparked weeks of tension and dissension, drawing international attention. In August a Maldives <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/maldives-commission-rules-former-presidents-resignation-was-voluntary.php">commission of inquiry</a> concluded that <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-president-resigns-after-protests-over-detained-judge.php">Nasheed's resignation</a> [JURIST reports] in February was legal and voluntary. In July the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/journalist-rights-group-concerned-about-press-freedom-in-maldives.php">claimed that press freedom</a> [JURIST report] in the country has been deteriorating since the resignation. Also in July a Maldives court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/maldives-court-refuses-to-hear-case-against-former-president.php">refused to hear the case</a> [JURIST report] against Nasheed, holding that it did not have jurisdiction to rule in the case. In April the Maldives Police Service <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/maldive-police-service-sends-criminal-court-chief-arrest-case-to-prosecutor.php">referred the case</a> to the Prosecutor General's Office two months after an <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ex-president.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST reports] was issued. A group of Maldives lawyers in January <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-lawyers-seek-icc-intervention-over-detained-judge.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] to review the legality of the arrest of Chief Justice Abdulla Mohamed. Also that month the Maldives Minister of Foreign Affairs had <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-seeks-un-help-to-resolve-detention-of-senior-judge.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the UN to help them to resolve the unrest arising out of the arrest of the chief justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, Judge Berdybek Myrzabekov found <a href="http://algadvk.kz/ru/about/coord/32/">Vladimir Kozlov</a> [official profile, in Russian], head of the unofficial <a href="http://algadvk.kz/ru/">Alga! party</a> [official website, in Russian], <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/08/kazakhstan-trial-idUSL6E8L8KL520121008">guilty of inciting dissent</a> [Reuters report] among striking oil workers in what became a series of <a href="http://www.azattyq.org/content/kazakhstan_zhanaozen_unrest/24423801.html">violent clashes</a> [RFE/RL report, In Kazakh] between police and workers that left 15 people dead last December. The judge declared that Kozlov had turned a labor dispute into a politicized strike on orders from billionaire Mukhtar Ablyazov, a rival of Kazakhstan President <a href="http://www.akorda.kz/">Nursultan Nazarbayev</a> [official website, in Russian]. Koslov, however, has consistently denied the charges and proclaimed that his case was an attempt by the President to quell civil protests within the country.

<p>Kazakhstan has recently drawn criticism from the international community for its human rights record. Last month <a href="www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] claimed that oil workers in the country <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-kazakhstan-oil-workers-subject-to-mistreatment-repressive-laws.php">face mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] and repression at the hands of the government and oil companies. In August HRW urged Kazakhstan to ensure that the trials of Koslov, another political activist, and an oil worker <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">comport with international legal standards</a> [JURIST report] for fair trials. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-urges-kazakhstan-to-allow-independent-probe-into-december-unrest.php">called for an independent probe</a> [JURIST report] into the December unrest between oil workers and an oil company. In June HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-demands-kazakhstan-justify-charges-against-political-activists.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan publicly disclose the reason for bringing new charges against a group of labor activists and an oil worker who participated in the December unrest. The committee charged them with "calling for the forcible overthrow of the constitutional order." Earlier that month a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 13 out of 37 defendants to between three and seven years of imprisonment for their participation in unrest that occurred last December.

In what is known as the "frontier dispute," the ICJ will be asked to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hHNywG9LFqsIFjmU-2twFoaNMQKA?docId=13015990d45447daa53c4f0de9eed4c2">determine the course of the boundary</a> [AP report] between the two countries from the astronomic marker of Tong-Tong to the beginning of the Botou bend, two areas that seemingly overlap across the border. Burkina Faso argues that the area between the landlocked West African nations was established in 1927 but never formally marked, thus leading to ongoing doubts about the exact border. Pursuant to their Special Agreement, both countries agree to accept the court's judgment and abide by its terms. Public hearings on the frontier dispute will continue throughout this week and next week, as <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/149/16955.pdf">determined by the ICJ last March</a> [press release, PDF]. Burkina Faso and Niger <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/149/15981.pdf">jointly submitted their claim</a> [press release, PDF] to the court in July 2010.

<p>In addition to the African frontier dispute, the ICJ was also considered to handle a territorial dispute in Asia between South Korea and Japan. In August South Korea <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-korea-rejects-japan-proposal-to-have-icj-resolve-dispute-over-islands.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] by Japan to have the ICJ resolve a continuing argument regarding a group of islands to which each nation claims possession. The islands, known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea, are believed to contain valuable natural gas deposits. Only a few days before the rejection, Japanese Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/annai/honsho/gaisho/gemba/ryakureki.html">Koichiro Gemba</a> [official website, in Japanese] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-to-take-legal-dispute-with-south-korea-over-islands-to-icj.php">urged South Korea</a> [JURIST report] to allow the ICJ to resolve the dispute. The hostility between the two countries over the islands escalated when South Korean President <a href="http://www.president.go.kr/kr/index.php">Lee Myung Bak</a> [official website, in Korean] <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/08/201281081820614896.html">made a surprise visit to the islands</a> [Al Jazeera report]. In March 2005 Japanese Prime Minister <a href="http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/koizumiprofile/index_e.html">Koizumi Junichiro</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/international-brief-icj-could-get.php">mentioned that the ICJ could be a good forum</a> for resolving the dispute over the islands. Earlier in March 2005, a Japanese prefecture <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/vote-highlights-japan-s-korea-dispute.php">approved a symbolic resolution</a> [JURIST report] calling for the creation of "Takeshima Day" to celebrate Japan's alleged sovereignty over the islands.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-796.htm">Bowman v. Monsanto Co.</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/11-796-Bowman-v.-Monsanto-Petition.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF], the court will review the scope of a <a href = "http://www.monsanto.com/Pages/default.aspx">Monsanto</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Monsanto">news archive</a>] <a href = "http://www.google.com/patents/US5352605?hl=en">patent</a> [text] on genetically-modified seeds that utilizes <a href = "http://www.monsanto.com/weedmanagement/pages/roundup-ready-system.aspx">Roundup Ready</a> [official profile] technology. The seeds are altered to "self replicate," which means that the more one plants the seeds, additional seeds will be produced. Monsanto sued a number of farmers who were using the self-replicating technology in harvests after the season they purchased the seeds, arguing the farmers should have to purchase new seeds every year. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Monsanto_Co_v_Bowman_657_F3d_1341_100_USPQ2d_1224_Fed_Cir_2011_Co">ruled for Monsanto</a> [opinion], stating that patent exhaustion had not occurred because "once a grower, like Bowman, plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup Ready technology and the next generation of seed develops, the grower has created a newly infringing article."

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-9335.htm">Alleyne v. United States</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Alleyne-cert-pet-final-signed.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider whether to overturn <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Harris_v_United_States_536_US_545_122_S_Ct_2406_153_L_Ed_2d_524_2">Harris v. United States</a> [opinion]. <span class = "casename">Harris</span> was a 5-4 splintered opinion that allowed a judge to be the fact-finder when increasing mandatory minimum sentences, as opposed to requiring the question to go to the jury. Since the case was decided, the court has gained three new members, and two in the majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, have left the court.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1118.htm">Gunn v. Minton</a> [docket; <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/11-01118qp.pdf">questions presented</a>, PDF] the court will consider who should adjudicate a dispute arising out of patent law, which would require interpretation of patents but does not rule on the merit of the patent. The Texas Supreme Court <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Minton_v_Gunn_355_SW3d_634_Tex_2011_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] that federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over any issue arising from a patent dispute. In this case, Jerry Gunn was sued by Vernon Minton for legal malpractice, and contends that Texas' state laws on malpractice should control.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1447.htm">Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PLF-PWC.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider when an agency can take land after denying a permit. The case will be analyzed under the essential nexus and rough proportionality tests of <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Nollan_v_California_Coastal_Commission_483_US_825_107_S_Ct_3141_9">Nolan v. California Coastal Commission</a> and <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Dolan_v_City_of_Tigard_512_US_374_114_S_Ct_2309_129_L_Ed_2d_304_3">Dolan v. City of Tigard</a> [opinions]. The tests determine the acceptability of permit requirements. In this case, the question is whether a government agency can deny a permit if the only requirement the resident does not meet is one that falls under that test. There is also a question of whether the tests apply when that agency requires the land-holder to use his/her own resources to convert personal property to public. The case is on appeal from the <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/St_Johns_River_Water_Mgmt_Dist_v_Koontz_77_So_3d_1220_Fla_2012_Co">Florida Supreme Court</a> [opinion].</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1545.htm">Arlington, Texas v. FCC</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/11-1545-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF], consolidated with <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1547.htm">Cable, Telecom. &#38; Tech. v. FCC</a> [docket], the court will consider if the <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Chevron_U_S_A_Inc_v_Natural_Resources_Defense_Council_Inc_467_US_">Chevron doctrine</a> [opinion] allows a federal agency to decide its own jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-9953.htm">Boyer v. Louisiana</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/01_scotus-cert-petition-4-19-12.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider a <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] case directly on appeal from the <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/State_v_Boyer_56_So_3d_1119_La_Ct_App_2011_Court_Opinion">Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Third Circuit</a> [opinion]. At issue is if the state violates the "speedy trial clause" by not paying court-appointed counsel in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-17.htm">McBurney v. Young</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-17-McBurneyPetition-copy.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider, under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/privileges_and_immunities_clause">privileges and immunities clause</a> [text] of Article IV, if a state can bar an out-of-state resident from accessing public records obtainable by a state resident. The court will also analyze this question under the dormant commerce clause. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/McBurney_v_Young_667_F3d_454_40_Med_L_Rptr_1321_4th_Cir_2012_Cour">held</a> [opinion] that Virginia's <a href = "http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+2.2-3700">Freedom of Information Act</a> [text], which prevents non-state residents from accessing certain state records, does not violate the Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a foreword to the report written by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile], she noted that in 2006 both sides to the conflict signed a <a href="http://un.org.np/sites/default/files/report/tid_188/2006-11-29-peace_accord-MOFA.pdf">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> [text, PDF], which obligated them to ensure justice and reparations for the victims, but they have failed to do so:<blockquote>Six years later the transitional justice mechanisms promised in the peace accords have still not been established, and successive governments have withdrawn cases that were before the courts. Perpetrators of serious violations on both sides have not been held accountable, in some cases have been promoted, and may now even be offered an amnesty.</blockquote>The report focuses on five categories of offenses: unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, arbitrary arrest and sexual assaults. According to the report, some of the acts committed in these categories during the conflict may amount to war crimes.

Nearly 500 judges, lawyers and other legal staff members <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/sri-lankan-judges-lawyers-boycott-courts-over-attack-on-outspoken-judge/2012/10/08/53557fa2-1159-11e2-9a39-1f5a7f6fe945_story.html">marched in front of the Colombo Court Complex</a> [AP report] carrying a coffin, which they said symbolized that death of Sri Lanka's independent legal system. Judicial Services Commission secretary and senior judge Manjula Thilakarathne was <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-judge-attacked/article3975069.ece">attacked</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> report] on Sunday by unknown men in Mount Lavinia, a suburb of Colombo.

At the end of September Thilakarathne publicly expressed concern about his safety and the safety of his colleagues, also said that their judicial independence was being infringed upon. Thilakarathne's <a href="http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/fullstory.php?nid=206677180">judicial tasks</a> [LBO report] include appointing, transferring and disciplinary control of judicial officers.

<p>Sri Lanka is still struggling to establish rule of law in the wake of a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009. The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war. In July the government of Sri Lanka said that it may take up to five years to prosecute people <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">accused of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder]. Earlier in July <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Sri Lanka to stop <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report]. In November the Sri Lankan government was subjected to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. In April 2011 a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In June 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-commissioner-calls-for-international-inquiry-into-sri-lanka-conflict.php">called for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the conduct of the Sri Lankan government during its civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 27-year-old man, whose identity has not been revealed, is being allowed to remain in the UK <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/war-criminal-wins-right-to-stay-in-uk-1.1398656#.UHQ17FGQl14">for his own safety</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report]. Immigration officials had <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9593234/Sudanese-war-criminal-wins-right-to-remain-in-Britain.html">originally rejected</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] the man's request to stay in the UK due to a Geneva Convention provision that bars refugee status for war criminals. Immigration judge CJ Lloyd overruled this decision, saying the man may face torture and other human rights violations in Sudan. The man gave widely disseminated interviews to BBC and <em>The Times</em> in 2008 that talked about his experiences in Sudan. Although the man appeared in the interviews with a black cloth over his face, the judge felt that people in Sudan has been able to determine the man's identity and may retaliate against him if he returned to his home country.  

<p>In August the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] urged Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sudan-to-investigate-into-violence-against-protesters-in-darfur.php">initiate an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations of excessive force by government security forces against protesters in Darfur Tuesday resulting in eight deaths and more than 50 injuries. In early July <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-urge-sudan-government-to-end-abuse-of-protesters.php">jointly urged</a> [JURIST report] the Sudanese government to cease its practice of arbitrarily arresting, detaining and abusing protesters in the country. The rights groups estimated that the country detained more than 2,000 protesters in June alone. In June the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-official-calls-on-sudan-government-to-improve-humanitarian-conditions.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about deteriorating conditions in Sudan due to continued violent conflict resulting in an increase of Sudanese refugees fleeing into neighboring countries.

With the suspension, the court also ordered the Philippines government to respond within 10 days to the 15 petitions challenging the constitutionality of the law.

HRW said that international human rights treaties ratified by Egypt should have clear supremacy over domestic law because the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf">Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties</a> [text, PDF] prohibits a country from using internal law as justification for failing to follow a treaty. While applauding that the draft constitution upholds "many key civil, political, social, economic, and cultural rights," as well as "other positive measures for human rights protection," HRW also criticized the draft constitution for its failure to: adequately protect against torture; provide for freedom of religion; increase freedom of speech; create a clear commitment to gender equality; strengthen protection of children; reinstate language prohibiting forced labor, trafficking, and slavery; include a provision on privacy; unequivocally include freedom of association; extend requirements ensuring the right to a lawyer for an accused person; and exclude an article giving "a legislative vetting role to an unelected, unaccountable body with no recourse to judicial review." The president of the Assembly has said the constitution is <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/08/egypt-fix-draft-constitution-protect-key-rights">expected to be ready by mid-November</a> [HRW press release], after which a referendum on the constitution and parliamentary elections would take place.

<p>Despite the success of a peaceful presidential election, Egypt has faced continued political turmoil since the overthrow of former president Hosni Mubarak last year. In August a lawyer in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-lawyer-challenges-morsi-declaration.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging a declaration by President Mohammed Morsi, granting himself <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">complete legislative and executive power</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in</a>, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the dissolved Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the country's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] dissolving it due to its finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Days before its dissolution, the Egyptian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-court-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-political-isolation-law.php">elected</a> a new constitutional council after lawmakers finally <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-reaches-agreement-on-constitutional-panel.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST reports] on the political composition of the council. In April the country's Administrative Court temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/egypt-administrative-court-suspends-constitutional-panel.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the work of the Egyptian Constituent Assembly after ruling in favor of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the formation of the panel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Libyan officials spoke during a hearing before the ICC, which is set to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/us-libya-icc-gaddafi-idUSBRE89812D20121009">decide</a> [Reuters report] whether Saif al-Islam will be tried in Libya or at the ICC in The Hague. ICC judges are worried that Libya cannot provide a <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/icc-debate-where-gadhafis-son-should-be-tried">fair trial</a> [AP report] for Saif al-Islam, who stands accused of crimes against humanity for murder and persecution during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] under Gaddafi's regime. Prosecutors indicated that they are willing to hand the case over to Libya but Saif al-Islam's lawyers insist that he will not get a fair trial there. If the ICC decides that Libya cannot provide a fair trial, there will be no way to enforce this decision, but Libya would be violating international law should the government choose not to comply. 

<p>Last month Libya <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/libya-to-delay-trial-for-gaddafis-son-for-five-months.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] Saif al-Islam's trial for five months so the prosecution could obtain evidence from Libya's former intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi. Al-Senussi was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/mauritania-extradites-libya-ex-intelligence-chief.php">extradited to Libya</a> [JURIST report] from Mauritania earlier in September on charges of murder and persecution for planning attacks on civilians during the Libya conflict. Saif al-Islam's trial was originally scheduled to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/libya-sets-september-trial-date-for-gaddafis-son.php">start</a> [JURIST report] in September. Although the ICC issued a warrant for Saif al-Islam for crimes against humanity, the militiamen who captured him insist that he be tried in Zintan, Libya, where he has been held since last year. Saif al-Islam was considered a likely successor to his father before an uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi's regime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-218.pdf">Tibbals v. Carter</a> [transcript, PDF], the court considered the "right to competence" in <em>habeas corpus</em> cases and whether a federal district judge can order an indefinite stay of a <em>habeas</em> action under precedent set in <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Rees_v_Peyton_384_US_312_86_S_Ct_1505_16_L_Ed_2d_583_1966_Court_O">Rees v. Peyton</a> [text]. In <span class = "casename">Tibbals</span>, the Solicitor General (SG) argued that <em>habeas</em> claims cannot be stayed indefinitely until a defendant is competent. In the present case, the SG stated that since Sean Carter's appeal was solely based on the record, he had no need of being competent for trial, but the government would approve limited stays "in situations where the prisoner's ability to effectively communicate with his counsel or to disclose evidence would be necessary to his claim." Carter's attorney argued for a bright line rule that is flexible for defendants, noting that there is a potential that meritorious claims that the defendant cannot communicate due to incompetence could be waived by time.

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-930.pdf">Ryan v. Gonzales</a> [transcript, PDF] the court considered whether <em>habeas</em> proceedings should be stayed pending a death row inmate's competence. The court focused more on if an inmate's incompetence and inability to assist his lawyer nullifies that he was provided counsel. The oral arguments for <span class = "casename">Ryan</span> began largely as a continuation of the previous argument, with petitioner's attorney immediately focusing on <span class = "casename">Rees</span> and its application to the <a href = "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ132/html/PLAW-104publ132.htm">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA) [text]. He argued that allowing these stays violates the AEDPA, which clearly intended to "speed up" the death penalty process. The respondent's attorney explained that there are too many ancillary claims in a <em>habeas</em> proceeding to decide without a competent client: "Well, in our particular case, we&#8212;we raise several claims in habeas&#8212;in <em>habeas</em> proceedings. We raise guilt claims, and we also raise sentencing claims. And it is often the case with our clients that, at their direction, they choose not to&#8212;not to pursue or do not want to pursue sentencing claims and want to only pursue guilt claims. So those are claims that are strictly on the record, and under the ABA guidelines the client is the ultimate decisionmaker as to where the particular representation is going. So that is a huge, all-encompassing decision that a client needs to make as to the ultimate outcome of his or her case."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge John Suddock held that the law is constitutional but struck down a provision that would have imposed civil liability on doctors who provide abortions without ensuring that parents have been notified. The law was approved by voters in August 2010 but was <a href="http://media.adn.com/smedia/2010/11/23/11/11.19.10_Complaint_for_Declaratory_and_Injunctive_Relief.source.prod_affiliate.7.pdf">challenged</a> [complaint, PDF] by <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/">Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest</a> [advocacy website], which argued that the law could cause women to <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2012/10/10/2326754/parental-notification-before-abortion.html">delay in getting abortions</a> [<em>Anchorage Daily News</em> report]. Suddock previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/alaska-judge-upholds-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">declined to enjoin the law</a> [JURIST report] but did make several changes. The number of abortions among teenagers in Alaska <a href="http://www.hss.state.ak.us/dph/bvs/PDFs/itop/2011_ITOP_Report.pdf">dropped in 2011</a> [HSS report, PDF] following the law's implementation.

<p>Many states have grappled with laws regarding parental notification for abortion procedures. In June 2011 the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/appellatecourt/">Illinois Appellate Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/illinois-appeals-court-orders-lower-court-to-rule-on-abortion-notification-law.php">ordered a circuit court</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether a law requiring a girl's guardians to be notified before she has an abortion should be enforced. The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2103&amp;ChapAct=750%C2%A0ILCS%C2%A070/&amp;ChapterID=59&amp;ChapterName=FAMILIES&amp;ActName=Parental%20Notice%20of%20Abortion%20Act%20of%201995.">Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 1995</a> [text], which has never been enforced, mandates that doctors notify the guardians of girls younger than 18 years old 48 hours before the girl gets an abortion. One day earlier Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-govenor-signs-bill-restricting-access-to-abortions.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill revising the definition of constructive notice required if actual notice of a parent is not possible, and affecting the ability of a minor to obtain a court waiver from the parental notification law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.mos-gorsud.ru/sud/">Moscow City Court</a> [official website, in Russian] freed Yekaterina Samutsevich after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19893008">accepting her argument</a> [BBC report] that she had been removed from the cathedral so quickly that she had barely had time to remove her guitar from its case and never had a chance to participate in the band's "punk prayer." The court also heard the appeal of the two other detained members of the band, Maria Alekhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, but upheld their two-year prison sentences. Though her prison sentence was suspended, Samutsevich will <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20121010/264941012.html">remain on probation</a> [RAPSI] for the next two years.

<p>Claiming her situation within the appeal was unique because she did not perform, Samutsevich had previously asked for a delay in the proceedings after <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-delays-appeal-hearing-for-feminist-activists.php">firing the lawyer</a> [JURIST report] that had been representing the band as a whole.

Several days prior to the trial Russian <a href="http://premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] called for the release of the band members, saying that time served has been severe enough and that any more time in prison would be counterproductive. The <a href="http://www.president-sovet.ru/">Russian Presidential Council on Human Rights</a> [official website, in Russian] has <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-rights-council-questions-prison-sentences-for-feminist-activist-band-members.php">questioned the legitimacy</a> [JURIST report] of the court's verdict and sentence.

The law comes in response to a <a href="http://www.olg-koeln.nrw.de/">Cologne state court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-court-criminalizes-circumcision-of-minors.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that circumcision of minors for religious reasons is prohibited. Though the court's judgment was limited to the Cologne region, the ruling sparked outrage in religious communities, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/germany-circumcision-laws_n_1914205.html">doctors refused to carry out the procedure</a> [Reuters report] because of the potential for legal action. The new law <a href="http://www.bild.de/politik/inland/beschneidung/kabinett-beschliesst-gesetz-zu-beschneidung-26636390.bild.html">requires</a> [Bild report, in German] that the procedure be done professionally, the parents be fully informed about the procedure, proper pain management steps be taken and the best interest of the child be taken into account. Ideally, this law meant to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/10/us-germany-circumcision-idUSBRE8990SB20121010?feedType=RSS&feedName=healthNews&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FhealthNews+%28Reuters+Health+News%29">end the uncertainty</a> [Reuters report] surrounding the legality of the practice in Germany.

<p>Late last month the <a href="http://www.bmj.de/DE/Home/home_node.html;jsessionid=01CC8CA5174883FD9FDCB483ED460F0F.1_cid324">German Federal Ministry of Justice</a> (BMJ) [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/germany-drafts-plan-for-allowing-circumcisions.php">drafted</a> [JURIST report] a similar law to allow circumcisions. Earlier that month a German state official clarified that <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/germany-minister-religious-circumcision-legal-in-berlin.php">circumcision for religious reasons is legal</a> [JURIST report] in Berlin. This clarification was made necessary by the Cologne court's ruling in July that prompted a Jewish hospital in Berlin to ask the justice minister to clarify the legality surrounding the circumcision procedure. Shortly after the controversial Cologne ruling, the German government <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-government-backs-circumcision-right-after-court-ruling.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would act swiftly to lift criminal sanctions imposed on circumcision. Spokesperson for <a href="http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BK/De/Homepage/home.html">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website, in German], Steffen Seibert, said that without adequate protections for the practice of circumcision, Jewish and Muslim communities would not be able to live in Germany because the practice is so fundamental to the groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Turkey</span> that a gay man was detained in violation of Articles 3 and 14 of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. A homosexual man filed a series of complaints during his detention in a Turkish prison alleging he was harassed and mistreated for his sexual orientation. The man argued that the treatment resulted in reduced mental and physical health, and that this treatment violated his rights under the ECHR. The human rights court agreed, holding that the inmate's treatment was based on his sexual orientation and amounted to a violation of the ECHR. In her dissenting opinion, Judge Jociene stated that, though she agreed the detention was in violation of Article 3, there was no evidence suggesting the plaintiff had been detained in solitary confinement, and therefore there could be no violation of Article 14. JURIST Guest Columnist Paul Johnson noted that the <a href="/hotline/2012/10/paul-johnson-echr-turkey.php">ruling is significant</a> [JURIST comment] because it is "the first time in its history that the [ECHR] has upheld a complaint related to sexual orientation under Article III."

<p>The ECHR has issued a number of rulings on various issues related to gay rights. In June the ECHR ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/europe-court-rules-moldova-gay-protest-ban-violated-rights.php">Moldova violated</a> [JURIST report] the rights to peaceful assembly and to be free from discrimination by banning gay groups from protesting in front of the country's parliament. In March the ECHR found that the right of a person in a same-sex partnership to adopt his or her partner's child is <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/europe-court-finds-no-right-to-same-sex-marriage.php">not protected</a> [JURIST report] by the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2010 the ECHR ruled that the European Convention on Human Rights does <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/europe-court-finds-no-right-to-same-sex-marriage.php">not mandate that member states recognize</a> [JURIST report] <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ohio <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/">Secretary of State Jon Husted</a> and <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Mike DeWine</a> [official websites] filed the request seeking to stay an order by the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] which ruled that the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0356p-06.pdf">early voting polls should remain open</a> [opinion, PDF] for the three days leading up to election day. Ohio argues that the circuit court erred in striking down the regulation because:<blockquote>[The Supreme] Court has unequivocally held that there is no constitutional right to absentee voting and that laws offering absentee ballots to some voters but not others are subject to rational-basis review unless the law "absolutely prohibited" voters "from exercising the franchise" ... It cannot seriously be argued that any voter&#8212;let alone an entire class of voters&#8212;has been disenfranchised when Ohio still offers [non-overseas] voters 230 hours of in-person absentee voting, more than 750 hours of absentee voting by mail, and 13 hours of voting on Election Day. The Sixth Circuit's ruling that lower income and lesser educated voters would not be able to vote at all other than through in-person absentee voting on these three particular days finds no support in fact or law.</blockquote>The Ohio code is being challenged by Obama for America, which argues that that the different election periods for different groups of citizens violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder] of the US Constitution. 

<p>The Sixth Circuit's ruling was handed down last week following an <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/ohio-appeals-early-voting-decision.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] filed in September. Earlier that month the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-orders-ohio-to-allow-early-voting-3-days-prior-to-election.php">issued a preliminary</a> [JURIST report] injunction preventing Ohio from enforcing the early voting limitation. <a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become especially contentious in the run up to the November presidential election. Also last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-florida-early-voting-law-amendment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida does not have to provide 96 hours of early voting for the November elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Thai <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.or.th/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] decided unanimously that <a href="http://www.thailandlawonline.com/Laws/criminal-law-thailand-penal-code.html#chapter-1">Article 112</a> [text] of the Criminal Code of Thailand fell <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/316362/thailand-constituional-court-rules-article-112-lese-majeste-law-is-constitutional">within the limits of the nation's constitution</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report]. Article 112 allows for anyone who "defames, insults or threatens" a member of the royal family to be sentenced to a prison term of three to 15 years. Somyos Prueksakasemsuk and Ekachai Hongkangwan, defendants in the cases heard by the court, claimed the <em>lese majeste</em> laws violated Sections 3, 8, 29 and 45 of the <a href="http://www.asianlii.org/th/legis/const/2007/">Thai constitution</a> [text]. The court disgreed, ruling that the constitution upholds and protects the monarchy.

<p>The <em>lese majeste</em> came under additional scrutiny recently following the arrest of an American man for violation of the law. Last December Joe Gordon was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-citizen-sentenced-to-prison-for-insulting-thailand-royalty.php">two-and-a-half years in prison</a> after he translated part of a banned biography and put the translation on the Internet, though he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/thailand-monarch-pardons-us-citizen-on-defamation-charge.php">pardoned in July</a> [JURIST reports]. UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Frank La Rue</a> [official website] recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-expert-condemns-thailand-royal-insult-law.php">condemned the <em>lese majeste</em> law</a> [JURIST report] shortly after the guilty plea was submitted: "The threat of a long prison sentence and vagueness of what kinds of expression constitute defamation, insult, or threat to the monarchy, encourage self-censorship and stifle important debates on matters of public interest, thus putting in jeopardy the right to freedom of opinion and expression. ... This is exacerbated by the fact that the charges can be brought by private individuals and trials are often closed to the public." In 2009 <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-group-condemns-closed-thailand.php">public trial</a> [JURIST report] for a Thai political activist accused of <em>lese majeste</em>. In 2009 a Thai court <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/thailand-court-sentences-political.php">sentenced an anti-coup protestor to 18 years</a> in prison. Shortly afterward Awzar Thi, a member of the <a href="http://www.ahrchk.net/index.php">Asian Human Rights Commission</a> in Hong Kong, wrote that in enforcing the law the <a href="/hotline/2009/09/thailand-judiciary-further-discredits.php">Thailand judiciary was discrediting itself</a> [JURIST comment] "in its hurry to defend increasingly outdated social arrangements."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] argued that the law violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The state responded that such procedures are necessary to prevent fraud. The court held that the new law should go in effect at the beginning of 2013 rather than during the November presidential elections because of the short time left to implement the law without discriminatory effects:<blockquote>Because the voters who currently lack qualifying photo ID are disproportionately African-American, proper and smooth functioning of the reasonable impediment provision would be vital to avoid unlawful racially discriminatory effects on African-American voters in South Carolina in the 2012 elections. Even assuming the best of intentions and extraordinary efforts by all involved, achieving that goal is too much to reasonably demand or expect in a four-week period&#8212;and there is too much of a risk to African American voters for us to roll the dice in such a fashion.</blockquote>The court reasoned that the law is valid because it does not deny citizens with non-photo voter registration cards the right to vote if they state the reason for not having obtained one, expands the list of qualifying photo IDs and makes it easier for citizens to obtain one. 

<p>South Carolina sued the DOJ in February in an attempt to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/south-carolina-sues-federal-government-over-blocked-voter-id-law.php">revive the law</a> after it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/DOJ-rejects-new-South-Carolina-voter-ID-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST reports] from taking effect. Six advocacy groups originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-voter-id-law-challenged.php">called on the DOJ to stop the law</a> [JURIST report]. The coalition argued in a letter to the DOJ that the new law would suppress the minority vote. According to the groups, there are more than 178,000 registered voters in South Carolina who lack a valid photo ID, and African-Americans are disproportionately affected. The groups also argued that African Americans face social and economic barriers to obtaining valid photo ID and that the law is in violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>]]></content:encoded>

University of Texas at Austin</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-to-rule-on-university-of-texas-affirmative-action-policy.php">report</a>], in which the plaintiff is challenging the constitutionality of the university's affirmative action program. The plaintiff, Abigail Noel Fisher, was denied acceptance to the university and claims that her race was a determining factor in her rejection. Fisher's attorney, Bert Rein, urged the court to review its current leading precedent on affirmative action, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZS.html">Grutter v. Bollinger</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/forum/symposium-aa/index-printer.php">symposium</a>] and determine both whether the university's admissions policy is consistent with that opinion and whether that opinion is still good law. While Rein stopped short of saying that <span class="casename">Grutter</span> should be overruled, he advocated for clarification and giving less discretion to university officials in using race as an admissions factor. The university and the US Solicitor General argued that university officials have only used the policy as necessary to give its student body a "critical mass" of underrepresented minorities as allowed by <span class="casename">Grutter</span>. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit last year <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-appeals-court-upholds-university-of-texas-affirmative-action-policy.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the university's policy, saying that it was in compliance with the constitutional standards set forth in <span class="casename">Grutter</span>. The appeals court's ruling affirmed the ruling of the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website], which also upheld the policy.

<p>The court also heard arguments Wednesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-702.pdf">Moncrieffe v. Holder</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-aggravated-felony-for-immigration-purposes.php">report</a>], involving what constitutes an "aggravated felony" for the purpose of determining whether an immigrant must be deported. The main issue is whether a conviction under state law which includes, but is not limited to, distribution of a small amount of marijuana without compensation constitutes an aggravated felony, notwithstanding that the record does not show that the defendant was convicted of conduct that would constitute a federal felony. If the Adrian Moncrieffe's conviction constitutes an "aggravated felony," he can be deported under federal statute <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227">8 USC &#167; 1227</a> [text]. The Fifth Circuit last year <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Moncrieffe_v_Holder_No_1060826_2011_BL_295490_5th_Cir_Nov_17_2011">upheld</a> [opinion] Moncreiffe's conviction and the classification as an aggravated felony, allowing for his deportation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his remarks to the press, Simonovic emphasized that the rebels' actions are particularly devastating for women in northern Mali:<blockquote>The number of enforced marriages is increasing, the price to buy a wife is less than $1,000. After getting out of their families, the women, once forcefully married, quite often are by their so-called husbands married to other men after a very short while, which is in fact then a smokescreen for enforced prostitution and rapes that are taking place.</blockquote>The conflict in Mali has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/10/us-mali-crisis-un-idUSBRE8991OI20121010">exacerbated a humanitarian crisis</a> [Reuters report] in north-central Africa.

<p>The humanitarian crisis in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mali">Mali</a> [JURIST news archive] has drawn a great deal of international scorn and scrutiny. Two weeks ago <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/islamic-groups-abuse-population-employ-child-soldiers-in-northern-mali.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that three armed Islamist groups in northern Mali are abusing the local population and recruiting child soldiers. Earlier in September UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-condemns-mali-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations in Mali and called for international action to address the problems. Pillay stated that two militant Islamic groups, MUJAO and Ansar Dine, are recruiting child soldiers, committing cruel punishments such as amputations and stoning an unmarried couple to death, violating basic human rights, committing sexual violence against women, and executing individuals. In August officials from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] were in Mali <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-investigating-allegations-of-war-crimes-in-mali.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] whether two Islamic groups, the MUJAO and Ansar Dine, had committed war crimes in Mali. According to Malian officials the Islamic groups had been committing human rights violations, including executing Malian soldiers, committing rapes, massacring civilians and recruiting child soldiers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The District Court <a href="http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.php?ud=20121011000868&cpv=0">ruled in favor</a> [<em>Korea Herald</em> report] of 11 Japanese and Korean activists representing the descendants of enslaved sex workers known as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA22/012/2005">comfort women</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=comfort+women">news archive</a>]. Although Japan has insisted that the 1965 treaty established that South Korea would not seek any further compensation for victims of sexual slavery during Japanese colonial rule from 1910-1945, the court ordered Japan to disclose information on 117 cases that it has sealed for the past 40 years. The court's decision comes just weeks after Japanese <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&ved=0CEEQFjAH&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftopics.nytimes.com%2Ftop%2Freference%2Ftimestopics%2Fpeople%2Fn%2Fyoshihiko_noda%2Findex.html&ei=SuV2UJqfJoyu8ATQnYCwBw&usg=AFQjCNEoC8ha81sCKtHwb5DkFZGNherwLQ&sig2=Z2uG8EVqdc6rdXgSUTUMoA">Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda</a> [NYT backgrounder] declared that the 1965 normalization treaty firmly <a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120827003529.htm">settled the issue of compensation</a> [<em>Daily Yomiuri</em> report] to comfort women. It is unclear if the Japanese government plans to appeal the decision. 

<p>In 2009 North Korea <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/north-korea-urges-new-japan-government.php">urged Japan's government to apologize</a> [JURIST report] for its use of comfort women during World War II. The <a href="http://www.jimin.jp/jimin/english/">Liberal Democrats</a> [party website], the party of former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4392480.stm">Shinzo Abe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Shinzo+Abe">news archive</a>], have denied that the Japanese Army officially forced women to become prostitutes. In July 2007 the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/us-house-passes-resolution-calling-for.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] calling on Japan to apologize for its use of comfort women during WWII. Abe <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/japan-pm-dismisses-us-resolution.php">dismissed the resolution</a> [JURIST report], claiming it was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/japan-pm-denies-wwii-comfort-women-were.php">based on erroneous information</a> [JURIST report] and that the women were professional prostitutes paid for their services. Abe has <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/japan-pm-issues-guarded-apology-to.php">expressed sympathy and apologized</a> [JURIST report] for the "situation" faced by so-called "comfort women" but stopped short of explicitly acknowledging the alleged roles of the wartime military and government in facilitating the practice. Japan has previously accepted that Japanese soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/japan-accepts-post-wwii-war-crimes.php">coerced</a> [JURIST report] women into prostitution but denied government involvement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, which was filed by the four villagers and <a href="http://www.milieudefensie.nl/">Friends of the Earth Netherlands</a> [advocacy website, in Dutch] in 2008, is the first time a Dutch company has been sued for the alleged misconduct of its foreign subsidiary. Shell has maintained throughout the trial that the case should be heard in Nigeria and that the Dutch court does not have jurisdiction. In a press release, Friends of the Earth Netherlands said that the case could set an international precedent encouraging victims of pollution by Western corporations to sue in the Netherlands and other nations in the EU, noting that there are hundreds of thousands of pollution victims in Nigeria alone. Shell has argued that the pollution damage was caused by thieves who sabotaged the oil lines and that its local subsidiary fulfilled its duty in cleaning up the spills. The verdict in this case is expected by early 2013. 

<p>Similar pollution lawsuits against Shell are pending in the US and the UK. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-rehears-arguments-in-corporate-liability-case-from-last-term.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] last week in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kiobel-v-royal-dutch-petroleum/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kiobel">news archive</a>]. The court heard new arguments on whether three oil companies, including Shell, are immune from US lawsuits under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute of 1789</a> (ATS) [text] for alleged torture and international law violations that took place overseas. The court initially <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">heard arguments in February</a> and then directed the parties to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-to-rehear-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-human-rights-violations.php">file briefs on a new question</a> [JURIST reports] for this term, which asked if the ATS can ever be used against against non-state citizens for atrocities committed in that state, and under what circumstances. JURIST Guest Columnists Michael Hausfeld and Kristen Ward Broz of Hausfeld, LLP have <a href="/sidebar/2012/10/hausfeld-broz-kiobel-jurisdiction.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the jurisdiction of US courts should apply to any entity that has a presence within the US, while the Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to limit corporate liability overseas and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-limit-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report]. In the UK, 35 Nigerian villages brought a suit against Shell in a London court in March, alleging Shell's <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/nigeria-villages-sue-shell-in-uk-court-over-oil-spills.php">slow response in cleaning up two oil spills</a> [JURIST report] in a Nigerian river ruined their livelihoods.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was filed by the widows of Juvenal Habyarimana, the former president of Rwanda, and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the former president of Burundi, who were killed when their plane was shot down on approach to Rwanda. The widows have alleged that Kagame ordered the attack, which was allegedly carried out by a rebel army in Rwanda. They sought $350 million in damages. In its decision, the court ruled that Kagame is immune from suit because he is the leader of a foreign state. The court's decision upholds a district court ruling finding the same and is consistent with a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ihli.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F09%2FUS-suggestion-of-immunity.pdf&ei=wQB3UIqfJ9LW0gGF8IGoBw&usg=AFQjCNHN6Nyvww6cMV2NoIkXlWVGB0ZCvQ&sig2=ANhSFaiTN2ora0TsCwtnUg">suggestion of immunity</a> [text, PDF] filed by the US government last year. 

<p>A report compiled by a French court in January appeared to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/france-report-clears-rwanda-president-of-assassination-charge.php">clear Kagame of accusations</a> [JURIST report] that he orchestrated the 1994 assassinations of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira. It concluded that the missile came from an area held by the Rwandan army, a unit of elite presidential troops, making it unlikely that Kagame could have been behind the attack. The death of Habyarimana is one of the incidents which sparked the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=1994+Rwandan+genocide+">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive; HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">backgrounder</a>]. Rwanda has been continually scrutinized in relation to the 1994 genocide. In a report released in June of last year, Amnesty International (AI) urged Rwanda to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/amnesty-calls-on-rwanda-to-review-genocide-laws-ideology-used-to-silence-dissent.php">review laws it claims have a "genocide ideology"</a> [JURIST report] that are being used to silence critics and dissenters. AI claims that Rwanda has broadly drafted hate speech laws passed since the 1994 genocide that are being used to criminalize legitimate criticism and expression that does not rise to the level of hate speech. In April 2010 Rwandan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] opposition presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, accusing her of denying the 1994 genocide.

Specifically, the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-apple-samsung-patent-idUSBRE89A11C20121011">found</a> [Reuters report] that "the district court abused its discretion in enjoining the sales of [Samsung's] Galaxy Nexus," a product that, according to Apple, constitutes infringement of a patent related to data search sources. Apple, however, was unable to show sufficient evidence of a "causal nexus" between its own products and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Said the court: "Regardless of the extent to which Apple may be injured by the sales of the Galaxy Nexus, there is not a sufficient showing that the harm flows from Samsung's alleged infringement." The case has been remanded to the Northern District of California for reconsideration.

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. In September, the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-circuit-orders-lower-court-to-reconsider-samsung-injunction.php">similarly ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Northern District of California to reconsider an injunction against Samsung's <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/GT-P5113TSYXAR">Galaxy Tab 10.1</a> [product backgrounder]. Only a week prior, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/apple-seeks-ban-on-sales-of-samsung-products-allegedly-infringing-on-patents.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] with the Northern District of California to prohibit Samsung from selling products in the US that supposedly infringe on Apple's patents. Also in September, Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/samsung-to-add-latest-iphone-to-apple-patent-infringement-lawsuit.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will be adding the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone5</a> [product backgrounder] to a new patent infringement suit against Apple. A judge for the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-trade-commission-rules-apple-products-do-not-infringe-on-samsung-patents.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that month that Apple products do not infringe on Samsung's patents. In August, Apple won a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">$1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung in a separate case in the Northern District of California that covered everything from the shape and design of the competing companies' tablets and smartphones to the technology employed in the devices' software interface. Following the jury award, Apple moved to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-moves-to-ban-8-samsung-products.php">block</a> [JURIST report] eight Samsung products from being produced and sold in the US. Also in August, a South Korean court found that Apple and Samsung had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-korea-court-rules-apple-and-samsung-violated-each-others-patents.php">violated each others' patents</a> [JURIST report] and banned the sales of some of the companies' products in the country. In July, a UK court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uk-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apples-design.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung tablets do not infringe on Apple's design.<br />

The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gVR_fCJmDccvDBlbS8_LqMnmWu1Q?docId=CNG.dc99d433f81db3ab4b1e23cd16d8d4f5.141">warrant was issued</a> [AFP report] following his failure to appear before the court in an ongoing trial on five criminal charges including abuse of power and violation of banking regulations at the state-owned Krung Thai Bank. Thaksin and the bank executives are accused of abusing their authority to lend 11.58 billion baht (USD $377 million) to companies which were known to have been in dire financial conditions. Thaksin was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/thai-military-revokes-constitution.php">removed from power</a> during a 2006 military coup and has been in self-exile abroad since 2008 following a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/thailand-ex-pm-thaksin-convicted-on.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] on a corruption charge which he claims was politically motivated.

<p>Thailand's political system has remained unstable following the coup that ousted Thaksin in 2006, and, despite his absence from the nation, he remains a polarizing political force within the country. In February 2011 seven leaders of Thailand's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13294268">"red-shirt"</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=red+shirt">news archive</a>] movement, which are formally known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship and are staunchly pro-Thaksin, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/thai-court-releases-9-opposition-protest-leaders.php">were released on bail</a> [JURIST report]. They had been arrested on terrorism charges stemming from their involvement in the 2010 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thailand+protests">anti-government protests</a> [JURIST news archive] in Bangkok. In January 2011 members of the movement also petitioned the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to launch a preliminary <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/thailand-red-shirts-petition-icc-to-review-violence-during-bangkok-protests.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether the government committed crimes against humanity during those protests. The Constitutional Court of Thailand ordered that 46.4 billion baht (USD $1.4 billion) of Thaksin's fortune be <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/thailand-court-seizes-assets-from.php">seized</a> [JURIST report] in Februrary 2010, a ruling that led to violent protests that took place in Bangkok last spring.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/files/ICEvNapolitanoFINAL.pdf">claim</a> [complaint, PDF], <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-secretary-of-state-challenges-obama-administration-immigration-policy.php">filed by</a> [JURIST report] Kansas <a href="http://www.kriskobach.org/">Secretary of State Kris Kobach</a> on behalf of 10 agents of the <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] against US <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/secretary-janet-napolitano">Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano</a> [official websites], alleges that the directive, known as Deferred Action, contradicts existing practice because it compels ICE officers not to enforce federal immigration laws or initiate removal proceedings against a broad class of roughly 1.7 million illegal immigrants. Bryant alleges that this order "usurps Congress's authority to regulate immigration and violates the constitutional separation of powers and the president's obligation to enforce federal law." He also argues that Mississippi has standing in the case "based on the significant fiscal costs that illegal immigration imposes on the state."

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a hot button issue in many states. At the end of September California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/-or-illegalimmigrants-or-immigration.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that will allow some illegal immigrants who came to the US as children to obtain state drivers licenses. Also last month lawyers for Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/arizona-to-appeal-federal-injunction-on-portion-of-state-immigration-law.php">announced a plan to appeal</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction currently blocking the provision of the controversial Arizona immigration law that criminalizes the harboring and transportation of illegal immigrants. In August the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">partially struck down</a> [JURIST report] Alabama and Georgia's immigration laws, but upheld other provisions. Also that month, Utah's Attorney General argued that the state's restrictive immigration law <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/utah-attorney-general-immigration-law-should-be-upheld-given-supreme-court-ruling.php">should be upheld</a> [JURIST report] in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf">Arizona v.

Passed by the lower congressional house earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/documentos/iniciativas/ley-recursos-procedencia-ilicita-terrorismo.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] was proposed two years ago by outgoing <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, in Spanish], a conservative who, after taking office in 2006, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-mexico-drugsbre89a1pv-20121011,0,196603.story">launched a military-led assault against drug cartels</a> [AP report] that has seen tens of thousands of people killed. While Calderon's administration is credited with the capturing or killings of <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/10/mexico-senate-drug-trafficking-cartel-approvedmoney-laundering-bill-.html">more than two-thirds of the country's most-wanted drug lords</a> [LAT report], until now there has been little effort to attack the cartels' multi-billion dollar flow of illegally-obtained cash. The new law establishes a special prosecution unit for money launderers and puts restrictions and reporting requirements on large casino bets, overly-generous charitable donations and cash purchases of real estate, automobiles, jewelry and other assets. The bill carries a minimum penalty of five years in prison. It will now go to Calderon to be signed into law. Estimates have put the annual amount of money laundered in Mexico in the range of USD $10&#8211;50 billion.

<p>Calderon has long supported the passage of money laundering legislation, which has finally passed just a month or so before he will leave office. Other legislation considered recently was a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/mexico-president-introduces-labor-law-reform.php">Calderon-introduced labor bill</a> [JURIST report] that provides for a broad range of reforms to Mexico's labor market, seeking to improve the transparency of Mexico's trade unions and make labor regulations more flexible. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/mexico-lower-house-approves-labor-reform.php">passed by the lower house</a> [JURIST report] last month in a bipartisan effort between Calderon's outgoing <a href="http://www.pan.org.mx/">National Action Party</a> (PAN) and the more liberal <a href="http://www.pri.org.mx/ComprometidosConMexico/">Institutional Revolution Party</a> (PRI) [party websites, in Spanish] of incoming president <a href="http://www.enriquepenanieto.com/">Enrique Pena Nieto</a> [campaign website].

Pursuant to the law, the provisional ballots were rejected even if the error was caused by a poll worker. More than 14,000 provisional ballots were discarded in Ohio in the 2008 elections as a result of this law. The court's decision upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-blocks-ohio-law-discarding-provisional-ballots-cast-in-wrong-precinct.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report] finding that the law should be blocked for the upcoming election. In its decision, the court found that the state law unfairly burdened Ohio voters: "The State would disqualify thousands of right place/wrong-precinct provisional ballots, where the voter's only mistake was relying on the poll-worker's precinct guidance. That path unjustifiably burdens these voters' fundamental right to vote." 

<p>Ohio <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/">Secretary of State Jon Husted</a> [official website] is currently defending another Ohio voting requirement in federal court. He recently <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/ohio-officials-appeal-early-voting-issue-to-supreme-court.php">filed an emergency appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court seeking permission to close early voting three days prior to election day for everyone but overseas military personnel. Husted and <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/">Attorney General Mike DeWine</a> [official website] filed the request seeking to stay an order by the Sixth Circuit which ruled that the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0356p-06.pdf">early voting polls should remain open</a> [opinion, PDF] for the three days leading up to election day. <a href="/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become especially contentious in the run up to the November presidential election. A federal court on Wednesday upheld a South Carolina voter ID law, but ruled that the state <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">could not enforce the law until 2013</a> [JURIST report] because of the short time left to implement it without discriminatory effects. A similar ruling was issued in Pennsylvania earlier this month.

Three of the men were convicted last month after a fourth suspect, Samuel Kargbo, plead guilty and testified for the prosecution. Santigie Borbor Kanu and Hassan Papa Bangura were convicted of two counts of "interfering with the administration of justice by offering a bribe to a witness" and for attempting to induce a witness who had given testimony before the special court to recant. Ibrahim Bazzy Kamara was convicted for attempting to induce a witness to recant testimony. The men have all been previously convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Their new prison terms will be added to their previous sentences. 

<p>The convictions in this case stem from indictments that were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-indicts-five-for-witness-tampering.php">issued last year</a> [JURIST report]. Kamara and Kanu had been <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-hands.php">convicted</a> of war crimes by the SCSL in June 2007, and <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-sentences.php">sentenced to at least 45 years in prison</a> [JURIST reports]. With the recent <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/charles-taylor-sentenced-to-50-years-for-war-crimes.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Charles Taylor, the SCSL has largely fulfilled its mission and will take steps to shut down. In November 2009, the SCSL <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-hands.php">handed over its detention facility</a> [JURIST report] to the Sierra Leone Prison Service in a monumental step towards the court's resolution. The month before, eight men judged guilty of war crimes by the court were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-transfers.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to Rwanda to serve out their terms. The SCSL was created in a joint endeavor by the government of Sierra Leone and the UN to provide a forum to try those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law, committed in Sierra Leone.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Key Dingake ruled that such laws are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hwHniUiWTvhdxdKAw5KaleZsM64w?docId=CNG.26e5a2027ea5d8023b27181d36bd2cef.171">not in line with the Botswana constitution</a> [AFP report], which guarantees gender equality. According to the legal rights group <a href="http://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/">Southern Africa Litigation Centre</a> [advocacy website], which supported the women plaintiffs, the five-year legal battle <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19924723">challenged an Ngwaketse customary law rule</a> [BBC report] that allows for the youngest-born son to inherit the family home. By Tswana custom the family home is either inherited by the first-born or last-born son, depending on tribe. The plaintiffs in <a href="http://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/library/item/mmusi_and_others_v_ramantele">Mmusi v. Remantele</a> [SALC case materials] are four sisters, all over 65 years old, who lived in the Mmusi family home about 50 miles south of Gaborone. Before dying their only brother left the home to his older half-brother, whose son later brought the present case to evict his aunts from the homestead. Arguing that the home was theirs by virtue of having contributed to its upkeep and expansion, Edith Mmusi and her sisters contested their 63-year-old nephew's claim in customary court in 2007, losing that challenge and the subsequent appeal. The sisters then turned to the civil courts, ultimately leading to the High Court's ruling striking down the customary law inheritance rules. SALC and other advocacy groups welcomed the ruling despite the position of the Botswana attorney general and the lower courts that undoing customary laws is damaging to the country's culture.

<p>Inequality in inheritance laws has become a global focus, particularly regarding inheritance issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In August a Minnesota trial court ruled that the state's <a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/bin/getpub.php?pubtype=STAT_CHAP&year=2007&section=517#stat.517.03.0">Defense of Marriage Act</a> [text] does not prohibit partners in same-sex couples from inheriting each other's assets, holding that while the Defense of Marriage Act bars same-sex couples from marrying, it <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/minnesota-court-rules-that-same-sex-couples-have-inheritance-rights.php">does not prevent same-sex couples from having the same inheritance rights</a> [JURIST report] as heterosexual couples. One year earlier Chilean <a href="http://www.gob.cl/presidente/">President Sebastian Pinera</a> [official profile, in Spanish] proposed legislation that would legalize <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22civil%20union%22">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive], <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/chile-president-introduces-civil-union-legislation.php">extending inheritance and social welfare rights to same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report] and unmarried heterosexual couples. In May 2011 the <a href = "http://www.stf.jus.br">Supreme Federal Court of Brazil</a> [official website, in Portugese] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/brazil-supreme-court-recognizes-same-sex-civil-unions.php">recognized legal rights for partners in same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST report], entitling gay couples in "stable relationships" to rights to community property, alimony, health insurance and tax benefits, adoption and inheritance rights. In August 2010 Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/index.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] ruled that a portion of the tax code requiring same-sex partners in a civil unions to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/germany-high-court-strikes-down-inheritance-tax-discrepancy-for-same-sex-partners.php">pay a larger inheritance tax than partners in opposite-sex marriages</a> [JURIST report] is unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report states that Boko Haram attacks have killed more than 1,500 people, primarily police and government forces, Christians, and Muslims accused of cooperating with government forces. The group is accused of bombing police stations, newspaper offices, Christian churches and a UN building. The group is also accused of executing police officers, forcing Christian men to convert to Islam or be murdered and assassinating Muslim clerics and political officials in the government. The report states that Nigerian security forces are also guilty of human rights abuses, however, including using excessive force, burning homes, abusing suspects and executing Boko Haram suspects without a trial. The report calls on Boko Haram to cease its attacks immediately and for the Nigerian government to halt its own abuses and bring individuals on both sides of the conflict to justice.

<p>Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government and create an Islamic state and has warned Christians in the mostly Muslim northern regions to leave the area. The group has publicly claimed responsibility for several attacks, including <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i4Vpsk9pJxwfvsGVSauUtxhi9puw?docId=CNG.08bf367b8562759d55ef1851220362a0.01">church bombings</a> [AP report] on December 25 that killed approximately 40 people.

Although Nigerian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12192152">President Goodluck Jonathan</a> [BBC profile] quickly promised to bring the militants to justice, he has since <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/nigeria-president-declares-state-of-emergency-in-parts-of-country-after-recent-sect-attacks/2011/12/31/gIQAN9xUSP_story.html">declared a state of emergency</a> [WP report] in several locations.

The OHCHR stated that Iran has failed to provide the accused with due process and fair trials and that the death penalty is not appropriate for certain crimes for which Iran is using it, including drug offenses. The UN has repeatedly called on Iran to abandon the death penalty, but instead the country has increased the number of people it is executing. More than 300 people have been executed in Iran since the beginning of 2012, mostly for drug charges, and many more are believed to be on death row.

<p>Iran has been heavily criticized for its use of the death penalty. In June three UN Special Rapporteurs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-condemns-iran-execution-of-four-minority-men.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran for executing four members of the Ahwazi Arab minority without providing them fair trials. The three UN Special Rapporteurs further stated that there is no transparency to Iranian court proceedings and that the death penalty should be reserved for only the most serious of crimes. In November the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-committee-concerned-about-iran-human-rights-standards.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the protection of individuals' rights in Iran, including the frequency of the use of the death penalty.

Amdt. 774] defining marriage as between one man and one woman bars a woman from adopting her female partner's child. The case concerned a woman, Cari Searcy, who married her partner, Kimberly McKeand in California in 2008. The appeals court <a href="http://progress.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20121013/NEWS02/310130027/Alabama-appeals-court-rules-same-sex-partner-can-t-adopt-mate-s-child?odyssey=tab|mostpopular|text|FRONTPAGE">held</a> [AP report] unanimously that even though the couple was legally married in California, Alabama's marriage law prohibits Searcy from adopting McKeand's child. Searcy and McKeand, who have been together for 14 years, both consider themselves the parents of McKeand's six-year-old biological son Khaya. It is unclear if the couple plans to appeal the ruling to the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm">Supreme Court of Alabama</a> [official website]. 

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] debate. Two weeks ago the <a href="http://ca2.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/second-circuit-hears-arguments-on-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the constitutionality of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:/">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text]. Earlier in September the US Department of Justice filed petitions in the US Supreme Court asking it to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/doj-asks-supreme-court-to-consider-two-additional-challenges-to-doma.php">consider two additional challenges to DOMA</a> [JURIST report]. In July a lesbian couple filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Central District of California in a DOMA challenge that seeks to achieve for gay and lesbian couples the <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lesbian-couple-seeking-immigration-rights-sue-to-overturn-doma.php">same federal immigration rights afforded to heterosexual couples</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextchannel=f3829c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD&vgnextoid=f3829c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> [materials].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a report to the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran Ahmed Shaheed declared that human rights activists in Iran are being <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/11/iran-human-rights-activists_n_1959739.html?utm_hp_ref=world">subjected to beatings</a> [Reuters report], mock hangings, sleep deprivation and threats that their family members will be killed or raped. Protests in Iran have become more frequent recently due to the nation's currency decreasing in value allegedly because of sanctions and mismanagement. In the report, Shaheed also noted that Iran has <a href="http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2012/10/shaheed_report/">cracked down on freedom of the press</a> [International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran report] by detaining and constantly watching journalists. This report was the third issued by Shaheed on the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran.  

<p>Iran's human rights record has come under international scrutiny recently. On Friday the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">urged Iran</a> [JURIST report] to halt all executions because the government has failed to provide the accused with fair trials and due process of law. In June three UN Special Rapporteurs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-condemns-iran-execution-of-four-minority-men.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran for executing four members of the Ahwazi Arab minority without providing them fair trials. The three UN Special Rapporteurs further stated that there is no transparency to Iranian court proceedings and that the death penalty should be reserved for only the most serious of crimes. In November the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-committee-concerned-about-iran-human-rights-standards.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about the protection of individuals' rights in Iran, including the frequency of the use of the death penalty. In January 2011, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran claimed that Iran is on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-group-accuses-iran-of-execution-binge.php">"execution binge"</a> [JURIST report], killing one prisoner every eight hours. In January 2010 <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran for executing 11 individuals on charges of mohareb, or being enemies of God, after appearing in televised show trials for their roles in post-election protests in 2009 .</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_HB_194_EN_N.html">regulation</a> [HB 194] would end early voting for everyone except overseas military members three days before election day. The state enacted the bill in July as the most recent amendment to its election process. Obama's campaign and the DNC challenged the law as a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] because of its alleged impact on certain groups of voters. Ohio filed an <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/ohio-officials-appeal-early-voting-issue-to-supreme-court.php">emergency appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court earlier this week after the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0356p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the early voting polls should remain open until election day. In its response, the Obama campaign argued that this is an "unprecedented" law that "allow[s] local election boards to open their polling places to some qualified voters over the last three days prior to Election Day, while precluding  those boards from permitting other voters to access those same polling places  during the same period." It also urged the Supreme Court to deny <em>certiorari</em> because it alleged Ohio's request "does not meet this Court's criteria for granting a stay" as it would only be considering a "fact-bound [contention] that may have no effect on other cases."

<p>Voting laws have been a controversial issue and the subject of much litigation throughout this election year. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-rejects-ohio-law-discarding-provisional-ballots-cast-in-wrong-precinct.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction against an Ohio state election law adopted in 2006 that discards provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct. A federal court on Wednesday upheld a South Carolina voter ID law, but ruled that the state <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">could not enforce the law until 2013</a> [JURIST report] because of the short time left to implement it without discriminatory effects. A similar ruling was issued in Pennsylvania earlier this month. A judge for the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court issued a preliminary injunction <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-blocks-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">preventing the state's voter identification law from taking effect</a> [JURIST report] for the upcoming presidential election, but allowed it to be implemented in future elections. Last month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-florida-early-voting-law-amendment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida does not have to provide 96 hours of early voting after the state's governor signed an amendment decreasing the time required.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The attorneys general brought suit against five publishing companies. Of those companies, <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/">Hachette</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/">Harpers Collins</a> and <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/">Simon &#38; Schuster</a> agreed to settle, while <a href="http://us.penguingroup.com/">Penguin</a> and <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/">Macmillan</a> [corporate websites] did not and will continue litigation. The settling publishers denied any wrongdoing and stated that they agreed to settle to avoid the cost, uncertainty and risk of litigation. The settlement fund totals $69.04 million and covers people who purchased an e-book published by any of the five publishing companies from April 1, 2010, through May 21, 2012, and lived in one of the areas bringing the lawsuit. People who qualify will be eligible for a credit or check refunding a portion of the purchase price for each qualifying e-book they purchased. A final approval hearing for the settlement will be held in February in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website].

<p>Last month a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/court-approves-settlement-in-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&id=218">similar settlement agreement</a> [opinion, PDF] between the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and certain e-book publishers in a price-fixing suit under the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a> [text]. The DOJ alleged that Apple, Hachette, HarperCollins, MacMillan, Penguin and Simon &#38; Schuster conspired to fix the prices of e-books in response to Amazon's discount pricing strategy. Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &#38; Schuster agreed to the settlement, but the other defendants elected to continue litigating. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">brought the suit</a> in April, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Commentators had been very mixed in response to the proposed settlement agreement. Some commentators have suggested that the DOJ's lawsuit is merely <a href="/forum/2012/04/daniel-crane-ebook-pricing.php">"superficial"</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the effect of the agency agreements may actually have been a net-positive to consumers if Amazon was selling e-books as loss leaders in order to drive the sale of Kindles. Other commentators, however, state that commentators against the settlement agreement and the defendants' arguments are based on a premise that <a href="/forum/2012/04/harry-gerla-ebook-pricing.php">competition is wrong</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charge allegedly arises out of a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9607343/Five-Royal-Marines-charged-with-murder-following-video-footage-discovery.html">video</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] that showed marines in an incriminating situation with a wounded member of the Taliban. An independent agency that supervises military prosecutions, the <a href="http://spa.independent.gov.uk/index.htm">Service Prosecuting Authority</a> [official website], decided to bring the murder charge against five of the nine marines arrested in relation to the incident. The other four were released. The five charged will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19940138">remain in custody</a> [BBC report] until appearing before a court martial.

<p>There have been several incidents arising out of the Afghan and Iraqi conflicts. In February the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-drops-charges-in-afghan-civilian-death-case.php">dropped all charges</a> [JURIST report] against Army Specialist Michael Wagnon, originally charged with killing Afghan civilians. In January US Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/final-marine-tried-in-haditha-killings-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charge of negligent dereliction of duty. Sgt. Calvin Gibbs was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-army-soldier-convicted-of-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">convicted of three counts</a> [JURIST report] of premeditated murder last November and was sentenced to life in prison. In December 2010 Staff Sergeant Robert Stevens<a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php"> pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers. Charges against Lt. Colonel Jeffrey Chessani were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/military-judge-drops-charges-against-us.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] in June 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=tUj0ocH87EU">Youtube video</a> [video], posted by Syrian opposition forces, showed remnants of cluster munitions allegedly near several towns. Markings on the remnants suggest they were dropped from aircraft. The report details several instances of cluster munitions being used and being reported by civilians. HRW has called for Syria to stop using these munitions and for local media to detail the dangers of them more extensively. The use of these munitions are prohibited according to the <a href="http://www.clusterconvention.org/files/2010/12/CCM-Text1.pdf">Convention on Cluster Munitions</a> (CCM) [text, PDF], which Syria has neither signed nor ratified, because of the potential harm they pose to civilians. The CCM bans the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster bombs, weapons that break apart, releasing large numbers of smaller, self-contained explosives which spread out before detonating on impact. 

<p>This is not the first HRW report calling attention to Syria using cluster munitions. In July HRW reported evidence of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/evidence-that-syria-forces-use-cluster-munitions-revealed-hrw.php">Soviet-made cluster munitions being used</a> [JURIST report] in Syria. The Convention was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nations-agree-on-cluster-bomb-draft.php">initially agreed upon</a> [JURIST report] by nations in May 2008 following 10 days of negotiations at the <a href="http://www.clustermunitionsdublin.ie/">Dublin Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions</a> [official website] while the US, Russia and China each declined to sign it. In November 2010 the former UN Deputy Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/unop/YABAshaRoseMigiro.htm">Asha-Rose Migiro</a> [UN profile] had urged more states to join the CCM at the <a href="http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/1msp/">First Meeting of States Parties</a> [official website]. The CCM officially <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/cluster-munitions-treaty-goes-into-effect.php">went into effect</a> in August 2010, six month after the UN's <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/cluster-munitions-treaty-to-take-effect.php">announcement</a> [JURIST reports], as binding international law with 107 countries having signed the treaty and 37 countries having ratified it. <br />

The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/15/salmond-cameron-scottish-independence-referendum-live#block-507bec7ac0e361310bc6cf02">agreement to allow the referendum</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] marks a turning point in a decades-long <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/scotland-does-not-have-legal-right-to-hold-independence-referendum-report.php">negotiation regarding independence</a> [JURIST report]. Currently scheduled for 2014, the referendum represents a compromise for both sides, with Cameron conceding his desire for an earlier vote and Salmond consenting to a straight up or down vote. Monday's accord, referred to as the <a href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/news/home-news/the-text-of-the-edinburgh-agreement-in-full.1350311932?_=ff3d3275e74dcbac2d970eea9ad779212cadda17">Edinburgh Agreement</a> [text], sets parameters for the handling of the referendum process, including promises on both sides to maintain "the highest standards of fairness, honesty and propriety, informed by consultation and independent expert advice." While earlier versions of the referendum included lesser possibilities, such as granting the <a href="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/">Scottish Parliament</a> [official website] increased autonomy and authority, this agreement offers only a <a href="http://www.snp.org/vision/better-scotland/independence">single option</a> [party website].

<p>The current draft of the referendum differs considerably in terms and direction from the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/scotland-government-unveils-draft.php">original</a> [JURIST report], presented in February 2010, although both draw their authority from <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/30">Section 30 of the Scotland Act</a> [text]. The current Scottish Parliament, formed in 1997 and known as the Holyrood, consists of 129 members, 52 percent of which are from Salmond's Scottish National Party, followed by 29 percent from Cameron's <a href="http://www.scottishconservatives.com/home/">Conservative Party</a> [party website]. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/world/europe/scottish-independence-vote-agreement.html?_r=0">Current polls</a> [NYT report] show 63 percent of Scottish voters opposed to independence and 37 percent supporting it. Cameron, facing an election in 2015, desired an earlier referendum date for political separation and has promised an aggressive campaign to maintain the Union. Salmond gained concessions to allow all Scots 16 years and older to vote on independence, despite the legal voting age of 18 in the UK, though this is expected to add only 2.5 percent to the rolls. Salmond hopes the Scottish people will find that the potential increase in revenues to be gained from a larger share of the North Sea oil fields, will offset the considerable loss of the British annual transfer payments which are critical to the Scottish economy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-15/apple-appeals-tokyo-court-s-ruling-for-samsung-in-lawsuit.html">appeal</a> [Bloomberg report] comes after Judge Tamotsu Shoji ruled in August that <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-court-dismissed-apple-patent-suit-against-samsung.php">Samsung did not violate</a> [JURIST report] Apple's patents for inventions allowing smart phones and tablets to synchronize music and video data with servers. The court subsequently dismissed Apple's claim for USD $1.3 million in damages along with its request for an injunction to block the sale of eight Samsung products in Japan. As a result of the dismissal, Apple was ordered to pay Samsung's litigation costs. 

<p>Apple's appeal is the most recent event in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans four continents. The Tokyo court handed down its August ruling after Apple won a USD <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">$1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/jury-foreman-discusses-apple-samsung-trial-verdict-ikNjTofgRRecKM4cFXZoZA.html">video</a>] against Samsung in late August in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. The dispute covered everything from the shape and design of the competing companies' tablets and smartphones to the technology employed in the devices' software interface. Further, a South Korean court held in mid-August that the technology companies had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-korea-court-rules-apple-and-samsung-violated-each-others-patents.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] each others' patents and banned sales of several products in the country. In July a UK court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uk-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apples-design.php">held</a> that Samsung tablets did not infringe on Apple's patents, and earlier in July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/apple-wins-another-preliminary-injunction-against-samsung.php">enjoined</a> [JURIST reports] Samsung to stop sales of its Galaxy Nexus smartphone in the US. Apple in April of last year <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/apple-sues-samsung-for-patent-infringement.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] the original suit alleging that Samsung had violated 10 patents, two trademarks and two trade dresses by copying iPhone and iPad technology in the making of its "Galaxy" products.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the ACLU, between 2004 and 2007 Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, including New Century Mortgage Company, violated the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/yourrights">Fair Housing Act</a> [HUD backgrounder], <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre15.shtm">Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> [FTC backgrounder] and <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/act_453_elliott_larsen_8772_7.pdf">Michigan Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act</a> [text, PDF] by targeting communities of color for predatory loans. The lawsuit, which the ACLU claims is the first of its kind, was filed in conjunction with the law firm <a href="http://www.lieffcabraser.com/home">Lieff Cabraser Heimann &#38; Bernstein</a> [firm website] and the <a href="http://www.nclc.org/">National Consumer Law Center</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.nclc.org/images/pdf/litigation/michigan/pr-morgan-stanley-lawsuit.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] on behalf of five African-American Detroit-area residents. The complaint states:<blockquote>Morgan Stanley's policies and practices have resulted in considerable racial disparities. They caused New Century borrowers in the metropolitan Detroit region to be significantly more likely to receive Combined-Risk Loans, and thus suffer the harms associated with such loans, if they were African American.</blockquote>The ACLU requested that the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] treat the claim as a class action lawsuit because "as many as 6,000 black homeowners in the Detroit area may have suffered similar discrimination."

The brief was filed after US President Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">campaign staff</a> [campaign website] and the <a href="http://www.democrats.org/">Democratic National Committee</a> (DNC) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12A338-Democrats-response.pdf">brief </a> [text, PDF] Friday <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/obama-campaign-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-ohio-early-voting-appeal.php">calling on</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme Court to reject Ohio's request. The Obama campaign's Friday filing was a response to Ohio's initial <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/ohio-officials-appeal-early-voting-issue-to-supreme-court.php">emergency appeal</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court earlier last week after the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that the early voting polls in Ohio should remain open until election day. Ohio <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/">Secretary of State Jon Husted</a> and <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov">Attorney General Mike DeWine</a> [official websites] have asked the Supreme Court to review the case given the "extraordinary circumstances" surrounding the matter as well as the rapidly approaching November election. The Obama campaign and DNC argue the case does not warrant review by the Supreme Court, but Ohio officials contends that "a decision striking down a state law as facially unconstitutional on the eve of an election is the definition of an important case." The Supreme Court has now received all briefs and is expected to act on the case soon.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">Voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have been the subject of significant debate and court decisions throughout this election cycle. Last week a federal court ruled <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">South Carolina's new voter ID law</a> [JURIST report] does not promote discrimination, allowing it to take effect next year. While strict voter ID laws still remain intact in a handful of <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">jurisdictions</a> [NCSL backgrounder], state and federal courts have recently been very active in reducing the requirements necessary to vote in the upcoming election. Earlier this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/mississippi-voter-id-law-delayed-pending-federal-review.php">Mississippi voter ID law</a> [JURIST report] was delayed beyond the November election pending federal review while the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court on remand from the state's Supreme Court issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-blocks-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against new legislation requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls. In September the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] approved a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/doj-allows-new-hampshire-voter-id-law.php">New Hampshire law</a> [JURIST report] requiring those who are unable to present a government issued ID will be permitted to cast a regular ballot after they sign a qualified voter affidavit and allow for a photograph to be taken of themselves at the polling location. In contrast, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-calls-texas-voter-id-law-discriminatory.php">rejected a stricter Texas law</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that it would disproportionately impact the state's Latino voters and promote discrimination. </p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW contends that there is no evidence of Rajab participating in violence and that his conviction is a violation of his right to peaceful assembly. Rajab is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to appeal his conviction.

<p>Bahrain has faced international criticism for its crackdown against dissidents since anti-government protests began last year. Earlier this month the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] for nine medics convicted for their involvement in Bahrain's pro-democracy uprisingAccording to BNA, the medics were working at Salmaniya Medical Complex [official website], and, during the time of the uprising, "took over the complex, detained and imprisoned kidnapped persons, and transformed the hospital to a place of illegal gathering and strikes, in violation of laws." According to Physicians for Human Rights, at least 95 health workers were arrested in Bahrain only after some medics treated those hurt by security forces and spoke out against the crackdown against protesters, which included firing upon ambulances. Last month government officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bahrain-pledges-to-follow-un-plan-to-improve-human-rights-conditions.php">pledged to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] the 158 recommendations included in the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BHSession13.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> [materials] regarding human rights abuses against political opposition.

Of the artists, intellectuals and political activists attacked, six filed formal complaints with police and identified their attackers. However, HRW contends that police have not made any arrests or initiated any investigations or prosecutions, as required by international law. Joe Stork, HRW deputy Middle East and North Africa director, stated that "[t]he failure of Tunisian authorities to investigate these attacks entrenches the religious extremists' impunity and may embolden them to commit more violence." HRW first urged Tunisia to investigate the incidents in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/14/letter-tunisian-minister-interior-and-minister-justice">July 2012 letter</a> [text] to the ministers of justice and interior and described that the country's authorities were already showing signs of failing to investigate attackers that appeared to be motivated by an Islamist agenda. Before receiving a response, another attack occurred on August 16 when a group of bearded men attacked a festival commemorating the international day for Jerusalem and injured at least three activists. HRW still has not received a response from Tunisian authorities.

<p>Tunisia has faced global criticism and political turmoil since former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12196679">Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Zine+Al+Abidine+Ben+Ali+">news archive</a>] left office amid nationwide protests in January 2011. In August the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice</a> [official website] urged the Tunisian government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-calls-on-tunisia-to-protect-womens-rights.php">ensure that women's rights are protected</a> [JURIST report] in line with the nation's international human rights obligations. Also in August HRW called on the new government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-urges-tunisia-lawmakers-to-ensure-judicial-independence.php">ensure judicial independence</a> [JURIST report]. In July a Tunisian military court sentenced Ben Ali <em>in absentia</em> to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/tunisia-court-sentenced-ex-president-to-life-for-killing-protesters.php">life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the killing of 43 protesters during the 2011 Tunisian revolution, which resulted in the death of more than 200 protesters. Ben Ali was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/tunisia-military-court-sentences-former-president-to-life.php">already sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the killing of 22 protesters. He has also been <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/tunisia-military-court-sentences-former-president-to-20-years.php">sentenced to 20 years</a> [JURIST report] on charges of inciting violence and murder in connection with the death of four protesters. In April the country's military appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/tunisia-appeals-court-upholds-conviction-against-ex-president-for-torture.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the convictions against the former president for torturing military officers over an alleged coup plot in 1991. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] all charges brought against him. During the 2011 revolution, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-tunisia-protester-abuses.php">called for investigations</a> into the Tunisia Security Force's alleged brutality against protesters, and HRW similarly <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hrw-calls-for-end-to-police-violence-in-tunisia-protests.php">urged police</a> [JURIST reports] to end the alleged violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-71-Gonzalez-S-Ct-Pet-for-Cert-2012.pdf">cert petition</a>, PDF], the first case of the term where they will consider one of the states' new <a href = "/feature/2012/10/us-voting-rights.php">voting laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Arizona's 2004 <a href = "http://www.eagleforum.org/column/2004/dec04/prop200.pdf">Proposition 200</a> [PDF], in part, requires citizens to show "proof of citizenship" in addition to photo identification, to vote. The court will determine if this requirement violates the <A href = "http://www.eac.gov/NVRA/">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA) [materials]. The court will also look at if the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in their ruling, erred by creating a heightened presumption test of the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiv">Elections Clause</a> [text] of the Constitution. The lower courts suggested that the <a href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/10/court-to-rule-on-az-voting-law/">presumption against preempting</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] a state's laws do not apply when the Elections Clause is in play, and that election law is a federal province to which a state must strictly conform. Justice Anthony Kennedy <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-stays-ninth-circuits-ruling-on-arizona-voting-law.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] the law in June, which blocked the law's implementation for this election season, but <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062812zr.pdf">vacated the stay</a> [order, PDF] later that month.

<p>When at the polls, potential Arizona voters are already <a href = "/paperchase/2006/10/supreme-court-rules-arizona-voter-id.php">required to produce photo ID</a> [JURIST report], but when registering to vote, Proposition 200 would require them to prove their citizenship. However, because registering to vote is a federal process, the state forms cannot contradict the federal forms. If one registered at a state office, one would have to provide an Arizona driver's license, a US passport, a birth certificate or naturalization documents. However, if one registered by mail or online using the federal form, they could escape this requirement&#8212;the federal form relies on an "honor system" where one checks a box saying they are a citizen.

This followed a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">three-judge panel panel</a> [JURIST report] ruling in October that reached the same conclusion.

Tymoshenko's lawyer, Serhiy Vlasenko, <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_15_10_2012_01">requested</a> [press release] the trial be postponed before court and reported that the court ignored his motion: "This was the latest farce in court. Everyone saw that the judge refused to consider the motion by the defense despite the fact that he considered the prosecution's motion several times." Nonetheless, the hearing was postponed due to Tymoshenko's absence. Tymoshenko is reportedly under the care of German and Ukrainian doctors for back pain. Recently, US Secretary of State <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_12_10_2012_01">Hillary Clinton</a> and former Secretary of State <A href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_04_10_2012_01">Condoleeza Rice</a> [press releases] have joined the <A href = "/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">US Senate</a> [JURIST report] in calling for Tymoshenko's release. The hearing is set to resume on November 13.

<p>Yulia Tymoshenkop has already been convicted and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to seven years in prison under charges of abuse of power and corruption. Her current trial is on charges of <a href = "/paperchase/2012/04/ukraine-ex-pm-on-trial-for-tax-evasion.php">tax evasion</a>, and she is awaiting trial on a charge of <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/ukraine-ex-pm-to-face-murder-charges.php">murder</a> [JURIST reports]. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href = "/paperchase/2012/08/europe-rights-court-hears-tymoshenko-appeal.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] in August on Tymoshenko's appeal to the abuse of power conviction. Tymoshenko alleges that all charges against her are politically motivated. Many in the West have agreed with her and support her efforts to overturn her conviction. JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.smorodsky.com/about.htm">Myroslaw Smorodsky</a> [official profile] of the Board of Governors of the <a href="http://uaba.org/">Ukrainian American Bar Association</a> [official website] <a href = "/hotline/2011/10/myroslaw-smorodsky-tymoshenko-sentencing.php">called her conviction</a> [JURIST comment] a "very tragic step backwards and a serious setback in the democratic evolution of the Ukrainian nation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hadzic, one 161 people tried by the ICTY, is <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/hadzic/ind/en/120322.pdf">accused</a> [indictment, PDF] of committing crimes against humanity and violating the law and customs of war in contravention of articles 5 and 7 of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf">ICTY statute</a> [text, PDF]. He allegedly coordinated, supported and instigated efforts to achieve the "permanent removal of a majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from a large part of the territory of the Republic of Croatia." These efforts included exterminations, murders, attacks, forced labor, deportation, destruction of property and robbery. 

<p>In August 2011 Hadzic entered a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hadzic-pleads-not-guilty-at-icty.php">not guilty plea</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY.

In August the military commission <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/military-commissions-grants-oral-arguments-for-aclu-torture-challenge.php">agreed to hear oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the protective order.

<p>As the trial for the accused 9/11 planners begins, many other Guantanamo detainees await decisions about their fate.

On his <a href="http://blog.da-medvedev.ru/post/258">video blog</a> [media website, in Russian] Medvedev acknowledged that 44 million Russians&#8212;a third of the entire population&#8212;are nicotine dependent, making Russia the second largest tobacco market behind only China. The bill as proposed would ban smoking in public places, putting in place a stage-by-stage process with the goal of eliminating smoking in restaurants, bars and cafes by January 1, 2015. <a href="http://government.ru/eng/persons/197/">Health Minster Veronika Skvortsova</a> [official profile] has <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c154/546752.html">campaigned for significant increases</a> [Itar-Tass report] on cigarette excise duties by 2015. If passed, the new tax would increase duties from 360 rubles (USD $11.65) per 5000 packs to 4000 rubles (USD $129.42). The Health Ministry expects that increased excise duties would decrease consumption by 10 percent and bring in approximately one trillion rubles in additional revenues. The bill is expected to be submitted to the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian], the lower house of parliament, in the coming days, with the expectation that the bill will become law by next spring. The Russian cigarette industry is valued at over $22 billion dollars by <a href="http://www.euromonitor.com/">Euromonitor International</a> [advocacy website], with 90 percent of the market dominated by Japanese, British and American tobacco companies.   

<p>The proposed legislation follows the trend mostly in Western nations that have imposed strict controls on tobacco sales, advertisements and bans on public smoking. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/australia-high-court-upholds-tobacco-plain-package-law.php">published its reasons</a> for <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/australia-high-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-law.php">dismissing a lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] brought by several large tobacco companies challenging new <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011A00148">labeling requirements</a> [TPP Act] that require cigarette packages to display graphic images warning of the dangers of smoking and ban brand logos. Similar issues have arisen in the US. In August the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that tobacco companies do not need to print graphic warnings of the danger of smoking, but in March the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that graphic cigarette <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/sixth-circuit-upholds-cigarette-warning-labels.php">label warnings are constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The court decided unanimously that the portions of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1256/text">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> [HR 1256 text], <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in 2009 and designed to limit the tobacco industry's ability to advertise to children, are a valid restriction on commercial free speech. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Google's new unified policy, which went into effect on March 1, outlines the company's practices and procedures used to collect data from users as they browse Google-backed sites like YouTube, Gmail and any site linked to a Google-backed site. EU regulators conducted an investigation leading to <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/fileadmin/documents/en/GOOGLE_PRIVACY_POLICY-_RECOMMENDATIONS-FINAL-EN.pdf">assertions</a> [report, PDF] that the new policy "suggests the absence of any limit concerning the scope of the collection and the potential uses of the personal data." EU regulators urged Google to address several main issues: <blockquote>Google provides insufficient information to its users (including passive users), especially on the purposes and the categories of data being processed. As a result, a Google user is unable to determine which categories of data are processed in the service he uses, and for which purpose these data are processed. ... [The policy] allows Google to combine almost any data from any services for any purposes. ... Combination of data ... requires an appropriate legal ground and should not be incompatible with the purpose for which these data were collected. ... Google does not collect the unambiguous consent of the user ... [and] the protection of the individual's fundamental rights and freedoms override Google's legitimate interests to collect such a large database. ... Google empowers itself to collect vast amounts of personal data about internet users, but Google has not demonstrated that this collection [is] proportionate to the purposes for which they are processed.</blockquote>CNIL further asserts its expectation that Google will "take effective and public measures" in addressing privacy concerns. The letter was signed by the policy regulators from 27 European countries.

<p>Google has already faced sharp opposition to its new policy around the world. In August Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/google-to-pay-ftc-million-fine-for-misrepresenting-privacy-protections.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to pay a record fine of $22.5 million to the  <a href="http://ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] after being charged with tracking users' search histories and targeting ads to those users in violation of a previous privacy settlement. In March EU's <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/justice/index_en.htm">Justice Commissioner Vice-President Viviane Reding</a> [official website] declared that Google's new policy <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eu-official-google-privacy-changes-are-in-breach-of-eu-law.php">violated EU privacy laws</a> [JURIST report], and EU data authorities voiced concern about the sharing and combination of personal data across services and its compliance with <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/index_en.htm">European data protection legislation</a> [text]. Google has also faced criticism for its policy in the US where the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] in late February <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed a suit</a> [JURIST report] filed by consumer privacy group <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website] asking the FTC to block Google's then proposed changes. In addition, the <a href="http://www.naag.org/">National Association of Attorneys General</a> (NAAG) [official website] in February <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/state-attorneys-general-concerned-about-google-privacy-policy.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Google signed by 36 state attorneys general expressing concerns about the company's new privacy policy. In January Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">issued a letter</a> in response to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">concerns raised by members of Congress</a> [JURIST reports] regarding consumer privacy rights as impacted by the new policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Convention is the primary weapon for countries to deal with transnational organized crimes, and the conference makes the countries united to promote their capacity to cope with such crimes. In the conference, civil society was mentioned as indispensable especially in countries where the legal system and institutions were vulnerable. The cost of transnational organized crime is estimated to be <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/transnational-organized-crime-threatening-international-security-un.php">$870 billion</a> [JURIST report], but Fedotov noted it would be impossible to "calculate the misery and suffering caused to millions of people by ... those illegal activities such as women and children trafficked for sex, developing countries devastated by illegal logging, and family and friends lost to illicit drugs." Fedotov suggested that countries work together to share information and initiate creative, proactive policies in an integrated manner to address the problem. 

<p>Transnational organized crime has been a problem affecting countries around the world. In July, when announcing its $870 billion estimate, the UNODC launched its <a href="http://www.unodc.org/toc/">global awareness-raising campaign</a> [campaign website] with the purpose of informing the public about the economic costs and human impact associated with the threat transnational organized criminal networks were creating. In February UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/west-africa-stability-threatened-by-organized-crime-drug-trafficking-un.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for an increase in efforts to address transnational organized crime, drug trafficking and piracy in West Africa. In June 2010 the UNODC released a report revealing the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-releases-report-detailing-impact-of-global-organized-crime.php">globalization of organized crime</a> [JURIST report] and its threat to international security. Afghanistan and Colombia were found to be the major suppliers of the majority of the world's illegal drugs, but the profits were primarily found where the drugs were sold. During the same month, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-state-department-issues-annual-report-on-human-trafficking.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that US complies with international regulations but still faces serious problem with human trafficking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hamdan was convicted of conspiracy and material support for terrorism under the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/PL-109-366.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [materials, PDF]. At issue in the case was whether the Military Commissions Act applied to Hamdan's conduct from 1996-2001. If not, the court examined whether his conduct constituted a war crime under the pre-existing military commissions statute. The appeals court held that because the Military Commissions Act does not retroactively punish new crimes, and because material support for terrorism was not a pre-existing war crime at the time of his conduct, his conviction must be vacated. The court held:<blockquote>To avoid the prospect of an Ex Post Facto Clause violation, we interpret the Military Commissions Act of 2006 so that it does not authorize retroactive prosecution for conduct committed before enactment of that Act unless the conduct was already prohibited under existing US law as a war crime triable by military commission. In this case, therefore, Hamdan's conviction stands or falls on whether his conduct was prohibited by the pre-existing statute 10 USC &#167; 821, at the time he committed the conduct...Material support for terrorism was not a war crime under the law of war referenced in 10 USC &#167; 821 at the time of Hamdan's conduct.</blockquote>Additionally, the court held that Hamdan's direct appeal of his conviction was not mooted by his release from custody.

<p>In June the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-appeals-court-considers-dismissing-war-crimes-conviction-challenge.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] attorneys in the case of the former <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainee to supply briefs explaining whether the issue has become moot because Hamdan already completed his sentence and is no longer living in the US. In a post-argument brief, lawyers for Hamdan argued that his conviction will continue to have adverse affects on his life, including his permanent ban on travel to the US and potential future political conflict with US army, which continues to occupy his home country of Yemen. Following the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/html/PLAW-107publ40.htm">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> [text] (AUMF) against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks, Hamdan was captured in Afghanistan while driving in a vehicle that contained two anti-aircraft missiles. He was then transferred to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba where the US Military detained him and, at a military tribunal, charged him as an unlawful enemy combatant who had committed war crimes. Hamdan challenged his conviction, prompting a decision from the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/Hamdan_vs_Rumsfeld.pdf">held</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-seeking-extended-sentence-for.php">report</a>] that his trial violated US and international law. Congress subsequently passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and Hamdan was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-found-guilty-by-guantanamo.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] yet again. Hamdan's conviction was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/military-court-upholds-war-crimes-conviction-of-hamdan.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] by a <a href="http://www.mc.mil/">US Court of Military Commission Review</a> [official website], prompting an appeal to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and ultimately resulting in Tuesday's decision. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/house-committee-sues-holder-to-force-subpoena-compliance.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], filed in mid-August, requests a court order requiring Holder to deliver specific documents subpoenaed by the committee in October and withheld by Holder under an assertion of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/executive_privilege">executive privilege</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The DOJ's motion states that the committee is attempting to use the judiciary to resolve a dispute between Congress and the Executive branch, which the DOJ argues has always been resolved though negotiation and accommodation between the two branches:<blockquote>For two hundred years, disputes over congressional requests for Executive Branch information have followed a common trajectory. Ordinarily, the Executive Branch provides information responsive to legitimate legislative inquiries while withholding material that implicates important Executive Branch prerogatives. Both sides seek to balance Congress's legitimate investigative concerns against the important confidentiality concerns of the Executive. The strength and nature of Congress's desire for information and the Executive's desire for confidentiality shift over the course of the negotiations, for a host of reasons.  The resulting "accommodation process" between the two co-equal Branches is political, and often disorderly and contentious, and the ultimate resolution often reflects a variety of considerations and compromises on both sides. But it is precisely the inherently political nature of the process of confrontation and resolution that makes it ill-suited for judicial review.</blockquote>The DOJ argues that the intervention of the judiciary would alter the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_powers">separation of powers</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] between the branches of the US government.

<p>Operation Fast and Furious was a failed DOJ investigation involving tracked guns that were permitted to travel from Arizona to Mexico in an attempt to stop weapons trafficking by high-level arms dealers. In June the DOJ announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/doj-will-not-prosecute-ag-holder-for-contempt-of-congress.php">not prosecute Holder</a> after the Oversight Committee voted to hold him <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/house-finds-ag-holder-in-contempt.php">in contempt of Congress</a> [JURIST reports] for failing to comply fully with the committee's subpoenas. Upon being held in contempt Holder <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/June/12-ag-829.html">responded</a> [press release], "Today's vote is the regrettable culmination of what became a misguided&#8212;and politically motivated&#8212;investigation during an election year," and stated he would continue to focus on the government's job of protecting the American people. Obama ultimately asserted executive privilege on the subpoenaed documents, effectively rendering the contempt charge moot. The DOJ submitted a <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/FINAL_FINAL.pdf">joint staff report</a> [text, PDF] to the committee in July 2011, discussing the effects of the admittedly failed operation in Mexico. The committee began <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-issa-subpoenas-atf-for-project-gunrunner-documents/">investigating the operation</a> [press release] through the DOJ's <a href="http://www.atf.gov/">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives</a> [official website] in April of that year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Relying on <a href="http://www.elc.org.uk/pages/lawarticleshra.htm">Article 3 of the Human Rights Act</a> [text] concerning prohibition of torture, May announced she would <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/uk-blocks-extradition-alleged-hacker-us-114835560--finance.html">stop McKinnon's extradition</a> [AP report]. May's decision rests upon <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk">Home Office</a> [official website] medical reports predicting McKinnon, who has clinical depression and Asperger syndrome, would likely commit suicide if extradited. McKinnon is accused of hacking into NASA, Department of Defense, Air Force, Army and Navy computers in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">US computer laws</a> [18 USC &#167; 1030] but claims he was trying to find evidence of UFO activity and extraterrestrial technologies. May's announcement ends a decade-long battle against extradition to the US for McKinnon. In August 2008 McKinnon was nearly extradited when the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the US. British extradition arrangements, however, kept the case in judicial review for several years. Now that McKinnon will not be extradited to the US, British public prosecutors will decide whether he should face trial.  

<p>In 2010 a member of the UK coalition government indicated that McKinnon's extradition to the US would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/uk-to-reconsider-us-extradition-of-alleged-hacker.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report]. May considered an adjournment request from McKinnon's legal team and agreed to delay a scheduled judicial review in order to determine if he was medically fit for extradition. McKinnon was arrested by British police in 2002 and again in 2005. In 2008, the UK Parliament criticized extradition law after three <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/uk-attorney-general-confirms.php">UK Enron Bankers were extradited to the US</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month the UK <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-court-approves-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">approved the extradition of terror suspects to the US</a> [JURIST report] after ensuring the US would not seek the death penalty, try the defendants before military tribunals or declare them enemy combatants.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Husted and Attorney General Mike DeWine filed the request to stay an order by the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] which ruled that the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0356p-06.pdf">early voting polls should remain open</a> [opinion, PDF].

Karadzic opened by <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/16/radovan-karadzic-i-should-be-praised">describing himself</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] as, a "medical doctor, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, group analyst and writer." He then testified that not only had he committed no war crimes, but he <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19958593">should be rewarded</a> [BBC report] for the efforts he made to finding a peaceful resolution in the Yugoslav conflict.<blockquote>Instead of being accused for the events in our civil war, I should have been rewarded for all the good things I've done, namely that I did everything in human power to avoid the war; that I succeeded in reducing the suffering of all civilians that the number of victims in our war was three to four times less than the numbers reported in the public; that I proclaimed numerous unilateral ceasefires and military containment and I stopped our army, many times, when they were close to victory; that I constantly sought peace and accepted four out of five peace agreements; that I advocated and initiated and implemented the humanization of the conflict by applying all measures of humanitarian action; that, in addition to my many presidential duties, I personally supervised the supply of humanitarian aid, ceasefires, and the honoring of the international law of warfare. And thus, I was the address for many successes of humanitarian actions. Also, I proclaimed and implemented many acts of mercy.</blockquote>Later in his opening argument, Karadzic accused Bosnian Muslims of staging some of the attacks on Sarajevo, suggesting that they had used mannequins to trick the international community into believing there were Bosnian causalities. Karadzic called one witness on Tuesday, Colonel Andrei Demurenko, who has testified in other ICTY hearings that Bosnia was the aggressor in the conflict and that the Serbian forces have been smeared by Western media. Demurenko was the Russian Chief of Staff for the UN peacekeeping mission. Karadzic will have <a href = "/paperchase/2012/09/icty-grants-karadzic-300-hours-to-present-his-defense.php">300 hours</a> [JURIST report] to present his case. The defense is expected to run two years.

<p>Karadzic has been accused of participating in the planning of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/675945.stm">1995 Srebrenica Massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica">news archive</a>], which resulted in the death of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys. In August the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/icty-denies-karadzic-request-for-new-trial.php">denied</a> Karadzic's request for a new trial after he argued that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/karadzic-asks-icty-for-new-war-crimes-trial.php">prosecution had failed to disclose</a> [JURIST reports] crucial information until after trial. The court reasoned that the delay in disclosing evidence has not infringed on Karadzic's right to a fair trial, although the court noted that "the number of disclosure violations in this case has reflected badly on the Prosecution." In early June the judges from the ICTY went on a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/karadzic-judges-visit-srebrenica-massacre-site.php">five-day visit</a> [JURIST report] to locations relevant to the indictment of Karadzic. They visited Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Srebrenica and surrounding areas. This visit came just months after the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/former-yugoslavia-municipal-officer-sentenced-to-2-years-for-refusing-to-testify.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former president of the municipality of Sokolac, BiH, Milan Tupajic to two months in prison for refusing to testify against Karadzic. In February former Commander of the Bosnian Serb Army <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1423551.stm">Ratko Mladic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=RATKO+MLADIC">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/accused-war-criminal-yugoslavia-tribunal-biased.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the ICTY of being biased.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled that a ban on funeral protests in Manchester, Missouri, was a legitimate restriction on the First Amendment, calling it a "legitimate time, place, and manner regulation" and saying it gave protesters ample opportunities to express their views in other venues. The challenge to the ordinance came from members of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Westboro+Baptist+Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a> [JURIST news archive] who routinely protest the funerals of soldiers and claim that US soldiers killed in combat are God's retribution for American tolerance of homosexuality. 

<p>Westboro's challenge relied heavily on the US Supreme Court's 2011 decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2981429692939250360&q=Snyder+v.+Phelps&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Snyder</a> [text] which held that funeral protests were a valid exercise of the First Amendment. In <span class="casename">Snyder v.

According to HRW, when a team of researchers with the group <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/16/libya-new-proof-mass-killings-gaddafi-death-site">arrived in Sirte</a> [press release] following the battle they found "the decomposing remains of at least 53 people at the nearby Mahari Hotel, some with their hands still bound behind their backs." The report, entitled "Death of a Dictator: Bloody Vengeance in Sirte," details the last hours of Gaddafi's life and the circumstances that eventually led to Gaddafi's execution. According to the report:<blockquote>Anti-Gaddafi forces captured alive an estimated 150 persons after the battle. They transported some 70 of these survivors to Misrata and held them there in custody, but at least 53 and possibly as many as 66 people were found dead the next day at the nearby Mahari Hotel. Amateur video footage recorded by a Misrata fighter shows 29 of the detained persons being beaten, slapped, insulted and spat upon by their captors, at the place of their capture. Six of the twenty-nine in the video have been identified by Human Rights Watch as being among the bodies photographed later on the grounds of the Mahari Hotel.</blockquote>HRW noted that the execution of prisoners is a war crime and that "Libyan civilian and military authorities have an obligation to investigate war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law."

<p>Gaddafi's death marked a milestone in the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">began in February 2011</a> [JURIST report] as part of a wider protest movement, commonly referred to as the "Arab Spring," that had spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In August Libya <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/libya-national-assembly-elects-gaddafi-opponent-for-interim-president.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] a Gaddafi opponent to be interim president. Last October family members of Gaddafi <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/gaddafi-family-plans-to-file-icc-war-crimes-complaint-against-nato.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with the International Criminal Court for its alleged role in Gaddafi's death.

This is the first time the DOJ has reported an increase in crime rates since 1993. Overall violent crime, which the DOJ defines as rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault, increased by 17 percent. Property crime, which the DOJ defines as burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft, increased by 11 percent. The DOJ attributed the increase in violent crime to an increase in reported assaults, emphasizing that rates for the other areas stayed steady or dropped. In the press release, the DOJ explained that overall violent crime is still trending downward:<blockquote>While the percentage change in violent crime from 2010 to 2011 is relatively large, the actual difference between the rates for those years (3.3 victimizations per 1,000) is below the average annual change in violent crime (4.3 victimizations per 1,000) over the past two decades. The low rates make the percentage change large, but crime still remains at historically low levels. Since 1993, the rate of violent victimization declined 72 percent.</blockquote>The full report was released by the <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> and is based on estimates of data from the <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245">National Crime Victimization Survey</a> [official websites]. 

<p>Overall crime rates in the US have been on the decline in recent years. In June the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov">FBI</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fbi-reports-another-year-of-decrease-in-violent-crime.php">violent crime rate had decreased</a> [JURIST report] for the fifth year in a row. This seeming disparity between agencies is due to a broader definition of violent crime utilized by the FBI that is inclusive of murder and other crimes not included in the DOJ report. Crime rates have descended in other North American nations as well. In July Canada <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/canada-crime-at-lowest-level-since-1972-report.php">reported the lowest crime rates</a> [JURIST report] since 1972. Last year <em>USA Today</em> issued a report showing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/violent-crime-rate-along-us-mexico-border-declining-usa-today.php">decrease in violent crimes</a> [JURIST report] along the US-Mexico border.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeals court ruled that changing the finance rules less than one month before election day and after absentee voting has already started would prove unfair to candidates who have followed these rules throughout the present campaign cycle. The court also held that because Montana's campaign contribution limits are among the lowest in the country, removing that limit as a matter of free speech pursuant to the 2010 US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>] would drastically alter the playing field. In choosing to extend its stay of the district court's injunction against the law, the court evaluated the following factors:<blockquote>(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.</blockquote><a href="http://americantradition.org/">American Tradition Partnership</a> [advocacy website], one of the groups challenging the law, <a href="http://americantradition.org/?p=2766">said</a> [press release] that while the ruling is a setback, it intends to continue challenging the law and expects to "prevail in the end."

<p>The conflict in Montana is part of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/supreme-court-denies-request-to-block-use-of-texas-election-district-maps.php">larger movement</a> [JURIST report] that brings the controversial <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> decision under fire. Last month the <a href="http://www.courtswv.gov/supreme-court/index.html">Supreme Court of Appeals for West Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/west-virginia-high-court-finds-public-campaign-financing-law-un-constitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a campaign law that provided that a publicly financed candidate would receive matching governmental funds after a certain threshold was met for each dollar spent by a private candidate. Earlier that month, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-minnesota-political-contribution-disclosure-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Minnesota law that required disclosure of campaign contributions. In August, Nebraska's high court also <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/nebraska-supreme-court-strikes-down-campaign-finance-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] its law that would have required the government to contribute to certain candidates to eliminate disparities between them and their opponents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ugandan foreign affairs minister Okello Oryem <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/10/2012101714443887755.html">vehemently denied</a> [Al Jazeera report; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiNm8uZoB9w">video</a>] the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-congo-democratic-rwanda-uganda-idUSBRE89F1RQ20121017">allegations</a> [Reuters report] that his government has sent troops and supplies to support the the 23 March Movement (M23) rebels. M23 is a group of a group of renegade soldiers attempting to destabilize the Eastern region of the DRC. Oryem called the report "rubbish and hogwash." He noted that the UN had not sent investigators into Uganda regarding this matter. Oryem also speculated that the UN was circulating the report "because on the ground in the eastern DRC there is the biggest number of UN peacekeeping operations in the whole world with the largest budget in the whole world, and [yet] they have failed to do anything in the past five to ten years."

<p>In August the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] reiterated their <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/security-council-reaffirms-condemnation-of-democratic-republic-of-congo-renegade-soldiers.php">condemnation</a> [JURIST report] of M23, and called on all foreign entities to cease aiding M23 and begin working with the Congolese government to dismantle the organization. That condemnation came two months after a <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/jurist-the-rwandan-government-has.php">report was leaked</a> in June about Rwandan involvement in the DRC following an <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/conflict-in-drc-threatens-civilians-un-rights-chief.php">initial call for a halt in the violence in the region</a> [JURIST reports]. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uganda">Uganda</a> [JURIST news archive] has drawn international criticism lately regarding its human rights record.

HRW urged the Security Council to address the issue in the open debate "Peace and Justice with a Special Focus on the Role of the International Criminal Court" that took place on Wednesday. Currently, under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], the Security Council can refer a situation involving a violation of international human rights under <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml">Chapter VII</a> [text] of the UN Charter. However, the Council has referred only two situations up to now: the situation in Darfur in 2005 and the situation in <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-council-condemns-violence-in-syria.php">Libya in 2011</a> [JURIST report]. Moreover, the HRW condemned the Council for changing its position during the ICC's Libya investigation when it ceased to support the ICC amid change in the country's political circumstances. HRW stated that the Council's "selectivity and double standard in making&#8212;and failing to make&#8212;referrals" has a detrimental effect on the ICC's effectiveness. During the open debate, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for a stronger collaboration between the Security Council and the ICC to achieve international peace and justice. Director of the court's Jurisdiction, Complementarity and Cooperation Division <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/office%20of%20the%20prosecutor/biographies/jcod?lan=en-GB">Phakiso Mochochoko</a> [official profile] stated that the relationship between the two entities could be strengthened by "extending interaction beyond specific situations referred by the Council and creating space for open discussions on thematic issues." HRW had previously called the 121 ICC member states to address the issue in the open debate in September <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/110772">letter</a> [press release].

<p>Since its inception in July 2002 the <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">ICC</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has become a dominant organization in international relations and the premiere tribunal for the prosecution of war crimes. During the period since ICC was established, it has investigated and prosecuted atrocities in countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Libya, Sudan and Uganda. Earlier this month, former militia leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200104/related%20cases/icc%200104%200106/democratic%20republic%20of%20the%20congo?lan=en-GB">Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a> [case materials] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/former-congo-militia-leader-appeals-icc-sentence.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] his ICC conviction and sentence.

In August the Chief Prosecutor of the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/TheProsecutor2012.htm">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-prosecutor-reduces-charges-in-kenya-cases.php">filed an updated version</a> [JURIST report] of the charges against the four defendants in the two cases stemming from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+and+2007+and+election">2007 Kenyan post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive]. The trials against the four defendants have been <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-sets-april-trial-date-for-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">set to begin</a> [JURIST report] next April after the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In September state officials <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/news/news_detail.aspx?ID=7010">petitioned</a> [press release] the appeals court to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/alabama-asks-federal-appeals-to-reconsider-immigration-law.php">reconsider its ruling</a> [JURIST report] after a three-judge panel rejected provisions making it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work or solicit work, imposing criminal penalties on persons who rent property to illegal immigrants and requiring state officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools. The court ultimately <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/201114535.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] several provisions, including one allowing police officers to check the immigration status of persons suspected of a crime. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has became a hot button issue over the past few years as many states have passed laws giving state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in September denied a request for a new injunction against a controversial provision of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070, PDF] which requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In August the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on two anti-illegal immigrant laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them. In July a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-declines-to-lift-injunction-against-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">declined to lift an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against South Carolina's controversial <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/20.htm">immigration law</a> [SB 20 materials], despite the recent Supreme Court ruling in <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">Arizona v.

The <a href="http://www.nihrc.org/index.php/home">Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission</a> (NIHRC) [advocacy website] challenged Articles 14 and 15 of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1987/2203/contents">Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987</a> [text], arguing that the "eligibility criteria for adoption are unjustifiably discriminatory." Justice Treacy concluded that the ban unlawfully discriminated against gay and unmarried couples. NIHRC Chief Commissioner Michael O'Flaherty <a href="http://www.nihrc.org/index.php/news/item/646">praised the ruling</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Through this case the Commission has sought to protect the best interests of the child. Given the high numbers of children in care, who need a family in Northern Ireland, the importance of this case in widening the pool of prospective parents cannot be overstated. We are therefore delighted with this outcome. It brings Northern Ireland law in line with the rest of the UK and means that couples who are not married, those in civil partnerships and same sex couples will be now be allowed to apply to adopt. Mr Justice Treacy agreed with the Commission that preventing someone from even being considered to adopt because of their relationship status is a discriminatory practice.</blockquote>Treacy also noted that there is no basis for excluding individuals from adopting on the basis of their relationship status.

<p>The controversy surrounding the rights of same-sex couples has been ongoing across Europe in recent months. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told a French television station in June that <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/france-pm-says-same-sex-marriage-and-adoption-laws-will-be-introduced.php">laws legalizing marriage and adoption for same-sex couples</a> [JURIST report] will soon be introduced in France. In March, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/echr-same-sex-couples-not-entitled-to-adoption.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the right of a person in a same-sex partnership to adopt his or her partner's child is not protected by the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CEIQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.echr.coe.int%2Fnr%2Frdonlyres%2Fd5cc24a7-dc13-4318-b457-5c9014916d7a%2F0%2Fenglishanglais.pdf&amp;ei=cwdqT9mXL4Hu0gGe-fCGCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFWDZNRnPDKtdJsYxGM9r0ZU9MSTQ&amp;sig2=FrVMB2ntUqJ7CFwC-OjLdw">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The British government is attempting to gain access to research done for the <a href = "http://thepensivequill.am/2012/10/the-belfast-project-and-boston-college.html">Belfast Project</a> [materials] at Boston College, an abandoned oral history of <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/flash/0,6189,344683,00.html">The Troubles</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder], a period of violence in Northern Ireland between Protestant and Roman Catholic organizations. The project included interviews with dozens of members of the predominantly Protestant loyalist cause as well as members of the Roman Catholic nationalist movement, including members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Through the project, two IRA members interviewed divulged details of the murder of <a href = "http://www.npr.org/2012/07/15/156811081/who-killed-jean-mcconville-a-battle-for-ira-secrets">Jean McConville</a> [NPR profile], a Belfast housewife and former IRA member. The IRA alleges that she was a spy for the British government, which forced her execution. The British government denies that, but there is speculation that <A href = "http://www.sinnfein.org/releases/gerry.html">Gerry Adams</a> [official profile], the president of <a href = "http://www.sinnfein.ie/">Sinn Fein</a> [party website], the major political party of Ireland, <a href = "http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/publications/chronicle/FeaturesNewsTopstories/2012/topstories/irish011912.html">ordered the killing of McConville</a> [<em>Boston College Chronicle</em> report]. The stay is in effect until November 16 to allow the parties time to file a <em>writ of certiorari</em> and will be extended pending the court's discussion of the writ. The case is docketed as <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12a310.htm">Ed Moloney and Anthony McIntyre v. United States</a> [docket].

<p>The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Moloney_685_F3d_1_1st_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] in July that there was no <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] right applicable to protect the interviews. "To be clear, even if participants had been made aware of the limits of any representation about non-disclosure, Moloney and Mclntyre had no First Amendment basis to challenge the subpoenas. Appellants simply have no constitutional claim and so that portion of the complaint was also properly dismissed." Boston College ended its appeals after the First Circuit decision, but the two journalists who spearheaded the project, <a href = "http://thebrokenelbow.com/about-ed-moloney/">Ed Moloney</a> [official profile] and <a href = "http://thepensivequill.am/">Anthony McIntyre</a> [official website] have continued to fight the subpoena. The British government is seeking the records of interviews with Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price. Hughes has since died, and Boston College has released those files. Price interviewed solely with McIntyre on the condition of complete confidentiality, and portions of her interview related to IRA materials are only known to McIntyre. Several <a href = "http://bostoncollegesubpoena.wordpress.com/congress/">US congress members</a> [materials list] have expressed support for McIntyre and Moloney, fearing the revelation of Price's interviews will unsettle the peace between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and violate the <a href = "http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/uploads/documents/Anglo-Irish/agreement.pdf">Good Friday Agreement</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the bill <a href="http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/233377/lo-que-hay-que-saber-para-entender-la-ley-de-despenalizacion-del-aborto/">declares</a> [<em>El Observador</em> backgrounder, in Spanish] that the public health care system must allow any woman to decide whether or not to have an abortion, senators removed language from the bill that proclaimed, "every adult woman has the right to decide whether to end her pregnancy during the first 12 weeks of gestation." Senator Luis Gallo, who voted for the bill, said that while the bill is far from perfect, it is a step in the right direction. Last month Uruguay's lower house, the <a href="http://www.diputados.gub.uy/">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website, in Spanish], <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/uruguay-lower-house-votes-to-legalize-abortion.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] by a narrow 50-49 margin. The bill will now go to <a href="http://www.presidencia.gub.uy/wps/wcm/connect/presidencia/portalpresidencia/presidente">President Jose Mujica</a> [official profile, in Spanish], who is expected to sign it into law. 

<p>Abortion continues to be debated internationally. Two weeks ago a court in Alaska <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/alaska-court-upholds-abortion-parental-notice-law-for-minors.php">upheld a state law</a> [JURIST report] requiring women under the age of 18 to notify their parents if they intend to get an abortion. Earlier that week a federal court in Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-holds-hearing-on-arizona-abortion-funding-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the constitutionality of a state law that prohibits government funding to facilities that perform abortions. Earlier in October the <a href="http://ca6.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sixth-circuit-upholds-ohio-law-limiting-abortion-pill.php">upheld an Ohio law</a> [JURIST report] limiting the use of RU-486, better known as the "abortion pill." In August South Korea's constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-korea-court-upholds-abortion-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] its abortion ban. Last year voters in Liechtenstein <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/liechtenstein-voters-reject-legalized-abortion.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to legalize abortion in the country after the acting Head of State expressed displeasure with the law and threatened to veto the proposed change. In 2010 the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-group-calls-philippines-abortion-ban-human-rights-crisis.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the restrictive abortion laws of the Philippines as a "human rights crisis," resulting in the death of thousands of women annually.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision by the three-judge panel upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uk-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apples-design.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report] finding that three of Samsung's tablets did not infringe on Apple's registered design patent. The issue in the case was whether Samsung's tablets were so similar in design to Apple's iPad to constitute design infringement. The court determined that Samsung's tablets, which contain noticeably distinguishable features on their front face, including a Samsung logo, are not sufficiently similar to the iPad to find infringement. The court also upheld an order requiring Apple to post a notice on its website notifying consumers of the decision in the case. The court said the notice is necessary to prevent harm to Samsung's sales that may result from consumers who believe that the product is illegal. 

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. On Monday Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed Apple's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. Last week the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uk-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apples-design.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] issued by the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Samsung in an ongoing patent dispute with Apple. In September the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-circuit-orders-lower-court-to-reconsider-samsung-injunction.php">similarly ordered</a> [JURIST report] the Northern District of California to reconsider an injunction against Samsung's <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/GT-P5113TSYXAR">Galaxy Tab 10.1</a> [product backgrounder]. Only a week prior, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/apple-seeks-ban-on-sales-of-samsung-products-allegedly-infringing-on-patents.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] with the Northern District of California to prohibit Samsung from selling products in the US that supposedly infringe on Apple's patents. Also in September, Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/samsung-to-add-latest-iphone-to-apple-patent-infringement-lawsuit.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will be adding the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone5</a> [product backgrounder] to a new patent infringement suit against Apple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Fearing there is little chance al-Senussi, a high-ranking member of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muammar+Gaddafi">news archive</a>] regime, could get a fair trial in Libya, AI has requested that Libyan authorities honor the ICC's outstanding arrest warrant. According to Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Programme Director at AI, "fair trials are still out of reach," in Libya, undermining "the right of victims to see justice and reparation." AI met with several government officials and lawyers last month who allegedly relayed stories of threats and intimidation, especially for those who might represent Gaddafi loyalists and officials like al-Senussi. AI claims that al-Senussi has had access to "no independent organizations, relatives or his lawyers" and that the ICC is the only opportunity he has for a trial achieving real justice. Sahraoui noted "A year after the end of hostilities, victims of serious human rights abuses&#8212;by the former government as well as its opponents&#8212;have yet to see justice. What we witness today in Libya is revenge and not justice." 

<p>Al-Senussi was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/mauritania-extradites-libya-ex-intelligence-chief.php">extradited to Libya</a> [JURIST report] from Mauritania in September on charges of murder and persecution for planning attacks on civilians during the Libya conflict as well as <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-prosecutor-may-press-additional-charges-against-libya-intelligence-chief-others.php">organizing mass rapes</a> [JURIST report]. The extradition to Libya happened despite a June 2011 ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-libya-leader-gaddafi,-his-son-head-of-intelligence.php">arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for al-Senussi, Gaddafi and Gaddafi's son <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Saif+al-Islam">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this month the Libyan government requested that the ICC allow Saif al-Islam to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">stand trial in Libya</a> [JURIST report] rather than the ICC, promising a fair trial could be held internally. Libyan prosecutors in August <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/08/201282315624361319.html">announced</a> [Al Jazeera report] that the prosecutors had completed their investigation of Saif al-Islam's alleged crimes and will soon approve a charge sheet, but in September it <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/libya-to-delay-trial-for-gaddafis-son-for-five-months.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] his trial for five months so the prosecution could obtain additional evidence from al-Senussi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Section 3 defines "marriage" under federal law as a "legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife" and "spouse" as a "person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife." Edith Windsor, the plaintiff in the case and the surviving spouse of a same-sex couple, married her partner in Canada in 2007 and was a resident of New York at the time of her spouse's death in 2009. Windsor was denied the benefit of the spousal deduction for federal estate taxes because of DOMA, prompting the legal challenge. After the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/second-circuit-hears-arguments-on-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that DOMA failed to satisfy rational basis and is thus unconstitutional, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] appealed the decision to the Second Circuit. Applying a standard of heightened judicial scrutiny, the Second Circuit held that DOMA unconstitutionally violated equal protection:<blockquote>Homosexuals as a group have historically endured persecution and discrimination; homosexuality has no relation to aptitude or ability to contribute to society; homosexuals are a discernible group with non-obvious distinguishing characteristics, especially in the subset of those who enter same-sex marriages; and the class remains a politically weakened minority. ... DOMA's classification of same-sex spouses was not substantially related to an important government interest. Accordingly, we hold that Section 3 of DOMA violated equal protection and is therefore unconstitutional.</blockquote>The Attorney General from the state of New York <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/statement-ag-schneiderman-court-decision-ruling-federal-defense-marriage-act">welcomed</a> [press release] the decision, calling it a "major step forward in the fight for equality." The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] may take up the issue this term, possibly in Windosor's case. Windsor <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/elderly-woman-petitions-supreme-court-to-expedite-doma-challenge.php">filed for expedited review</a> [JURIST report] in July. 

<p>The decision by the Second Circuit the most recent development in the ongoing debate over <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last week a court in Alabama <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/alabama-court-rules-woman-cannot-adopt-same-sex-partners-child.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that a state statute that defines marriage as between one man and one woman bars a woman from adopting her female partner's child. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/doj-asks-supreme-court-to-consider-two-additional-challenges-to-doma.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court to hear Windsor's case and another challenge to DOMA, arguing that the law unconstitutionally interferes with the right of the states to define marriage. Last year, the Obama administration <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html">instructed</a> [press release] the DOJ to stop defending DOMA in court, prompting BLAG to take up the mantle of <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/jurist-members-of-the-house.php">defending the law</a> [JURIST report]. House <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> [official website] convened a meeting of BLAG and issued a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/press-release/statement-house-speaker-john-boehner-r-oh-regarding-defense-marriage-act">statement</a> [press release] that the constitutionality of the law should be "determined by the courts, not by the president unilaterally."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's decision overturns a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kenya-court-rules-no-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">2010 ruling</a> [JURIST report] which found that Kenya does not have jurisdiction outside of its national waters. The appellate court, composed of a five-judge panel, concluded that the decision below <a href="http://www.africareview.com/News/Somali+pirates+to+be+tried+in+Kenya/-/979180/1536440/-/130irb6z/-/index.html">failed to consider the negative economic effects</a> [Africa Review report] experienced in Kenya as a result of piracy. The court determined that Kenya does have jurisdiction to try piracy suspects regardless of the location of the event or the suspect's national origin. In the decision, Judge David Maraga said the country derives its jurisdiction from both its national penal code and international law governing issues of piracy. He ordered the suspects in the case to be transferred to Mombasa to stand trial. 

<p>A number of countries around the world have been making attempts to solve the problem of maritime piracy. In May a United Arab Emirates court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/somali-pirates-sentenced-to-life-in-uae.php">sentenced 10 Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report] to 25 years in prison. Also that month six accused Somali <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/accused-somali-pirates-face-trial-in-paris-court-for-hostage-incident.php">pirates went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in a Paris court for taking 30 crew members hostage in 2008 on the ship Le Ponant in the Gulf of Aden. The US government in March <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/us-hands-suspected-somali-pirates-over-to-seychelles-for-prosecution.php">handed over</a> [JURIST report] 15 suspected Somali pirates it captured in January to the Republic of Seychelles for prosecution. Italy ordered its <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/italy-court-orders-trial-for-accused-somali-pirates.php">first international piracy trial</a> in February against nine Somali pirates, while France began its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/france-to-prosecute-suspected-somali-pirates.php">first international piracy trial</a> [JURIST reports] in November. Last October the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-security-council-resolution-urges-stricter-anti-piracy-measures.php">adopted a resolution</a> encouraging states to criminalize and punish piracy after maritime piracy reached an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/maritime-piracy-at-all-time-high-somalia-waters-driving-explosion.php">all-time high</a> [JURIST reports] in 2010. The UN also <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">donated $9.3 million</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 to fund piracy courts in Seychelles and Kenya, the only two countries that have created such courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay, who previously served as a UN war crimes judge, cited the possibility that both the Syrian Army and the Free Syrian Army have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. In her statement, she emphasized the importance of coming together to aide Syria during this conflict:<blockquote>I urge the Security Council to speak with one voice. That is essential in order to send a strong message. The longer this vicious conflict continues, the more lethal it becomes not just for Syria's own long-term future, but also for the entire region. Already, the spill-over into Turkey is threatening regional peace and security. I fear for Syia's children, many of whom will be scarred for life by the dreadful and prolonged traumatic experience they are suffering. ... By remaining divided, the international community is enabling the continuation of the suffering and helping create the circumstances for a wider regional conflict.</blockquote>Extending her focus to other nearby countries, Pillay also expressed concern for the fragile situation of those people in revolutionary uprisings including Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen.   

<p>Since 2011, Syria has been engaged in an ongoing internal conflict between the Syrian army and the <a href="http://www.free-syrian-army.com">Free Syrian Army</a> [official website]. Pillay's statement comes at a time of civil uprising and increased concern over the conflict in Syria. Last week a human rights watchdog uncovered evidence of the Syrian military <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-hrw.php">using banned cluster bombs</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, the investigative commission on Syria testified before the UN Human Rights Council that human rights violations in Syria were committed by both sides and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-investigators-human-rights-violations-in-syria-increasing.php">increasing in severity and number</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay has previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-calls-for-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">addressed the rights violations</a> [JURIST report] faced by Syrian citizens. In July Amnesty International accused government forces and rebels in Syria of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/syria-government-opposition-forces-committing-extrajudicial-executions-ai.php">summarily capturing and killing</a> [JURIST report] opposition forces in violation of international humanitarian law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

While the working group conceded that "adultery may constitute a valid ground for bringing a civil proceeding" in some cultures and traditions, the assembly of individual experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12673&LangID=E">wholly declared</a> [press release] that such an offense should not be deemed criminal. Wrote the group:<blockquote>Adultery laws have usually been drafted and almost always implemented in a manner prejudicial to women. Provisions in penal codes often do not treat women and men equally and establish harsher sanctions for women, and in some countries, rules of evidence value women&#8217;s testimony as half that of a man's</blockquote>Moreover, the group asserted that maintaining adultery as a criminal offense exposes women to "extreme vulnerabilities" and violates their inherent rights under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], which was adopted by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] in 1976. Specifically, wrote the group, such adultery laws infringe upon women's' Article 17 rights to "dignity, privacy, and equality, given the continuing discrimination against them." 

<p>Discrimination and violence against women is a global issue. In June <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/sudans-death-by-stoning-violates-international-laws-hrw.php">called on the Sudanese government</a> [JURIST report] to reform its discriminatory laws and abolish both the death penalty and all corporal punishment after a young Sudanese woman was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. In March HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-human-rights-watch-hrw-1.php">urged the Afghan government</a> [JURIST report] to release about 400 women and girls who were imprisoned for "moral crimes," including flight from unlawful forced marriage or domestic violence in addition to "zina," which is a sexual relationship outside of marriage due to rape or forced prostitution. In July 2011 <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/">UN Women</a> [official website] released a report examining the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/women-still-facing-global-discrimination-un.php">persistent discrimination against women</a> [JURIST report] around the world and concluded that the rule of law does not provide adequate protection for women in practice. A month earlier a UN Special Rapporteur stated that even the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">US is facing continued violence against women</a> [JURIST report], especially poor, minority and immigrant women. In May 2011 the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/council-of-europe-launches-international-treaty-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] the first <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm">international convention to combat violence against women</a> [text]. In the same month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-tunisia-egypt-to-protect-womens-rights.php">urged Tunisia and Egypt</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that women's rights receive constitutional protection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Council's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-eurozone-greece-court-idUSBRE89H1M420121018">non-binding ruling</a> [Reuters report] concerned two measures passed by the Greek government in 2010 at the urging of the country's international creditors. One provision extended to one year the "trial period" during which workers can be dismissed without notice, and the other measure cut, to two-thirds of the national minimum wage, the minimum pay for workers under 25 years of age. Based on an appeal by Greek public sector unions the Council's <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/ECSR/ECSRdefault_en.asp">European Committee of Social Rights</a> (ECSR) [official website] held that the reforms contravened the <a href="http://www.coe.int/T/DGHL/Monitoring/SocialCharter/">European Social Charter</a> [materials], in that the "trial period" extension contradicted the charter's mandate that workers are entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the lowered youth wage meant that affected young Greeks would fall below the poverty line of &#8364;580 per month. The ECSR does not have the power to enforce its ruling but can recommend to the 47-nation Council to adopt a resolution calling on Greece as a member state to take corrective action.

<p>The Council plays a watchdog role for human rights issues across the European continent. Last month Council <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/secretarygeneral/sg/biography_en.asp">Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland</a> [official profile] advocated for <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/europe-human-rights-overseer-urges-open-and-honest-elections-in-ukraine.php">free and fair parliamentary elections in Ukraine</a> [JURIST report] as he condemned the imprisonment of former prime minister and opposition party leader <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">news archive</a>]. In July the Council joined <a href="http://www.amnesty.md/">Amnesty International Moldova</a> [advocacy website, in Romanian] in calling for an assessment of the constitutionality of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-group-condemns-moldova-chemical-castration-law.php">new law that allows chemical castration</a> [JURIST report] of anyone found guilty of violent pedophilia. In June <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Bulgarian Justice Minister Diana Kovacheva to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-calls-on-bulgaria-to-denounce-anti-gay-violence.php">denounce calls to violence by anti-gay groups</a> [JURIST report] in anticipation of a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) pride parade in Sofia, on the grounds that Bulgaria, as a member state of the Council, is subject to the recommendation of the Council's Committee of Ministers to member states to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two other detained members of the band, Maria Alekhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, had also appealed, but the <a href="http://www.mos-gorsud.ru/sud/">Moscow City Court</a> [official website, in Russian] upheld their two-year prison sentences.

<p>Samutsevich was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">freed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. Claiming her situation within the appeal was unique because she did not perform, Samutsevich had previously asked for a delay in the proceedings after <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-delays-appeal-hearing-for-feminist-activists.php">firing the lawyer</a> [JURIST report] that had been representing the band as a whole. Several days prior to the trial Russian <a href="http://premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] called for the release of the band members, saying that time served has been severe enough and that any more time in prison would be counterproductive. The <a href="http://www.president-sovet.ru/">Russian Presidential Council on Human Rights</a> [official website, in Russian] has <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-rights-council-questions-prison-sentences-for-feminist-activist-band-members.php">questioned the legitimacy</a> [JURIST report] of the court's verdict and sentence. Pussy Riot's defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-ask-judge-to-recuse-herself-in-trial.php">moved</a> [JURIST report] earlier in August to have one of the judges recuse herself from the case, saying her decisions were politically motivated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UNAMID <a href="http://unamid.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=11027&ctl=Details&mid=14214&ItemID=19769&language=en-US">reported</a> [press release] the ambush occurred when unidentified assailants opened automatic and mortar fire on a UNAMID convoy in North Darfur which was on its way to follow up on recent reports of violence.

The defendants, ranging in age from 19&#8211;50, were found guilty on charges of kidnapping and conducting an attack on maritime traffic. They were sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to seven years. The trial was the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">first piracy trial in Germany in 400 years</a> [JURIST report]. It was also one of the longest trials in Germany since World War II, with language issues and age verification of the defendants delaying trial progress. The defendants had argued for leniency throughout the trial, citing political instability in Somalia and the surrounding region as a factor influencing their conduct. Critics have argued that the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/german-trial-of-somali-pirates-turns-into-pointless-and-expensive-farce-a-855252.html">expensive trial</a> [Der Spiegel commentary] will not have any meaningful effect on piracy in the Somali region.   

<p>A number of countries around the world have taken actions in the attempt to solve the problem of maritime piracy. Earlier this week an appeals court in Kenya concluded that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kenya-appeals-court-allows-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">Kenyan courts have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to try international piracy suspects. In July the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/icc/imb">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website] reported that the number of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/international-maritime-bureau-reports-global-piracy-down-by-half-in-2012.php">global pirate attacks fell sharply</a> [JURIST report] in the first half of 2012, the <a href="http://icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre">IMB Piracy Reporting Centre</a> [official website] (PRC) having received <a href="http://icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report">reports</a> [materials] of 177 incidents in the first six months of this year, compared to 266 incidents for the same period in 2011. In May a United Arab Emirates court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/somali-pirates-sentenced-to-life-in-uae.php">sentenced 10 Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report] to 25 years in prison. Also that month six <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/accused-somali-pirates-face-trial-in-paris-court-for-hostage-incident.php">accused Somali pirates went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in a Paris court in connection with the 2008 hijacking of the cruise ship Le Ponant in the Gulf of Aden.The US government in March <a href="jurist.org/paperchase/2012/03/us-hands-suspected-somali-pirates-over-to-seychelles-for-prosecution.php">handed over</a> [JURIST report] 15 suspected Somali pirates it captured in January to the Republic of Seychelles for prosecution. Last October the UN Security Council adopted a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-security-council-resolution-urges-stricter-anti-piracy-measures.php">resolution</a> encouraging states to criminalize and punish piracy after maritime piracy hit an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/maritime-piracy-at-all-time-high-somalia-waters-driving-explosion.php">all time high</a> [JURIST report] in 2010. The UN has also donated <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">$9.3 million to fund piracy courts</a> [JURIST report] in Kenya and the Seychelles, the only two nations with such unique judicial bodies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that the appellant developed a benign tumor on the left side of his face due to his job's requirement that he spend 5-6 hours a day on the phone. The <a href="http://www.ilgiorno.it/brescia/cronaca/2012/10/18/788794-cellualre-brescia-cassazione-corte-tumore-inail-manager-innocente.shtml">Supreme Court held</a> [<em>Il Giorno</em> report, in Italian] the injury entitled the appellant to an 80 percent disability pension. The Supreme Court's decision was largely based upon studies performed by the <a href="http://www.radiationresearch.org/pdfs/royal_society_hardell.pdf">Hardell Group</a> [text] between 2005 and 2009, which the court held showed an increased risk of malignancy due to heavy mobile phone use. The Italian <a href="http://www.inail.it/Portale/appmanager/portale/desktop">labor agency</a> (INAIL) [official website, in Italian] argued in favor of indemnifying the manager, as the situation in the instant case was unique and non-indicative of normal phone use.  

<p>The connection between mobile phone use and cancerous growth has long been debated in scientific communities. The <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) [official website] <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/">compiled studies</a> [WHO fact sheet] over several decades that have yet to support the causal link claimed by the Italian court, and Hardell's conclusions have been <a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2011/05/31/who-verdict-on-mobile-phones-and-cancer/">challenged by many researchers</a> [Cancer Research UK report]. Attempts to find the causal link are greatly hampered, not only by the available evidence and the duration involved with the growth and detection of tumors, but by rapidly changing microwave output levels of phones at various stages of technology, basic difficulties in assessing the exposure level to the radiation itself and claims that microwave output levels <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/san-francisco-cell-phone-radiation-ordinance-challenged.php">cannot be correlated to exposure</a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The case was originally brought 16 years ago and alleges that the defendants illegally financed the campaigns of certain political candidates in the 1990 election. Former Army Chief Mirza Aslam Baig and Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Asad Durrani are accused of supporting and facilitating the illegal funding in hopes of defeating the then-ruling political <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> (PPP) [party website]. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support charges against the two officials, noting that former president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who is now deceased, was also likely involved in the scandal. The court ordered a transparent investigation by the country's <a href="http://www.fia.gov.pk">Federal Investigation Agency</a> [official website], criminal charges to be brought against the officials, and for those still living to be brought to trial. 

<p>This decision comes in the wake of years of hearings dating back to the 1996 petition filed by Khan, a former Air Marshal. The petition <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/29/world/asia/pakistan-intel-election/index.html">resurfaced in the Supreme Court in February</a> [CNN report]. The 1990 election was a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7014433.stm">victory for the right-wing political party</a> [BBC timeline], the Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA). It resulted in the defeat of a number of different PPP officials, including the highly-revered former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>].

Judge Neil Wake <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/20/us-usa-abortion-arizona-idUSBRE89J00C20121020">declared</a> [Reuters report] that the law may harm women who rely on such facilities for health services other than abortion. The temporary injunction was issued as a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/planned-parenthood-arizona-sues-state-officials-to-block-new-law-restricting-funding.php">lawsuit filed in July</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppaz/">Planned Parenthood Arizona</a> (PPA) [advocacy website] arguing that the law deprives women of several constitutional rights and violates federal law regarding Medicaid patient rights by restricting options in choosing a physician. Arizona Solicitor General David Cole <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/free/20121019arizona-planned-parenthood-ruling-funding.html">stated</a> [AP report] that while he was disappointed with the court's decision to issue the injunction, he expects that Arizona will eventually win the case on its merits. The court is expected to hold another hearing on the case in early December.

<p>Arizona is currently facing multiple lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of recently passed abortion restrictions. Last month a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-enjoins-arizona-abortion-law.php">issued an emergency injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Arizona law that prohibits abortions after 20 weeks into a pregnancy except for in medical emergencies, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-challenge-arizona-abortion-law.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> and the <a href="http://acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona</a> [advocacy websites] in July. The law restricting funding to abortion clinics was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/05/us-usa-abortion-arizona-idUSBRE84402Y20120505">signed by Governor Jan Brewer in May</a> [Reuters report], while the law banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy was <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/arizona-governor-signs-bill-to-ban-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed in April</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge was filed by the <a href="http://lowellmountainsnews.wordpress.com/2012/05/27/lowell-mountains-group-fundraiser-june-10-2012/">Lowell Mountain Group</a> [<em>Lowell Mountains News</em> backgrounder] and the towns of Albany and Craftsbury, and claims that the project would negatively affect the region's environment. The court <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/2012/10/19/supreme-court-upholds-lowell-wind-permits/NREBHEIGeNnB0YQFmawJfO/story.html">held</a> [AP report] that the wind project's positive effects, such as providing electricity and economic growth to the Lowell Mountain region, outweighed the potential environmental concerns.

The Public Service Board <a href="http://www.state.vt.us/psb/orders/2009/files/7250finalorder.pdf">gave final approval to the wind project</a> [order, PDF] in April of 2009. The project is expected to begin generating electricity soon.

<p>The environmental impact of energy generation has been a hotly contested legal issue recently. In September the <a href="http://ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/Ninth-Circuit-dismisses-Alaska-village-claim-over-greenhouse-emissions.php">dismissed nuisance claims</a> [JURIST report] by an Alaska village against energy companies for emitting greenhouse gases.

Because the court's ruling was handed down on a Friday afternoon the convicted men, who include former Chief of Defense Staff Lieutenant General Lang Tombong Tamba and other former officers, will have to wait until Monday to appeal the decision. The men were convicted and sentenced to death in 2010. AI argues that this is contrary to Section 18(2) <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/research/gambia-constitution.pdf">Gambian Constitution</a> [text, PDF], which only allows for execution of those who are convicted of a crime resulting in the killing of another person. AI West Africa Program Director Lucy Freeman further urged the Gambian government to uphold its current moratorium on the death penalty and not to execute the convicts:<blockquote>The Gambian government must not carry out any executions, and commute as a matter of urgency the death sentences of the seven men &#8212; and all death row inmates. They must also uphold the moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty.</blockquote>Gambia Supreme Court decisions are usually able to be reviewed by a panel of seven judges.

<p>Gambia had not put anyone to death for nearly three decades before August 23, when nine prisoners were secretly taken from their cells and executed by firing squad. Last month Gambian <a href="http://www.statehouse.gm/president.html">President Yahya Jamme</a> [official website] implemented an <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/gambia-president-halts-executions-amid-international-pressure.php">"conditional" moratorium</a> on executions as a result of international pressure after the government ended the previous 27-year moratorium with the August <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gambia-executes-death-row-inmates-according-to-amnesty-international.php">firing squad executions</a> [JURIST report], which included eight men and one woman. A few days before executing the nine prisoners Jamme caused an international outcry when he <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/23/world/africa/gambia-inmates-execution/index.html">announced</a> [CNN report] that he planned to execute all death row inmates by September. Jamme has stated that the current moratorium will be automatically lifted if crime rates increase.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The secretaries-general directed their statement at all parties involved, but in particular called on the Syrian government to "show wisdom and vision and stop the killing and destruction so that all the issues, however complex, can be addressed through peaceful means." The call for a ceasefire come on the same day that UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict Leila Zerrougui expressed <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43338&Cr=syria&Cr1=#.UIL3Eml25tt">concern over the killing of children</a> [UN News Centre report] in the conflict, especially on the part of the Syrian government. Zerrougui called on "all parties to the conflict in Syria to refrain from acts against the civilian population, including children" and encouraged all sides to also heed Ki-Moon and El Araby's request for a ceasefire. The UN reports that more than 20,000 people have been killed in Syria over the past 19 months, most of them civilians.

<p>The Syrian government has been in conflict with the <a href="http://www.free-syrian-army.com/">Free Syrian Army </a> [official website] since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence.

According to HRW, the bill would go against the spirit of the recent US Supreme Court ruling in <u>Miller v. Alabama</u>, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-rules-mandatory-life-sentences-for-juveniles-unconstitutional.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that mandatory life sentences for juveniles is unconstitutional. The bill applies a prison sentence of either life without the possibility of parole for juveniles or with the first parole hearing after 35 years for those over 15 and 25 years for those under 15. In the letter, HRW detailed several problems with the law: <blockquote>It ignores that youth have a greater capacity for rehabilitation than older offenders. It ignores the racially disproportionate sentencing of youth in Pennsylvania. African American youth convicted of murder have been sentenced to life without parole in Pennsylvania at a much higher rate than white youth. It provides virtually zero public safety value at a very high cost. It will not provide a deterrent to future crime. Experts have shown that adolescents are unlikely to have the maturity and long-term rational thinking to be deterred by the prospect of a lengthy sentence.</blockquote>HRW also pointed to international obligations which bind Pennsylvania, and all other states, to treat juvenile offenders differently than adults and allow for rehabilitation. 

<p>HRW is asking Governor Corbett to veto the bill in light of the <u>Miller</u> decision which was handed down in June. There has been much commentary written on this issue both <a href="/hotline/2012/04/jason-szanyi-juvenile-sentencing.php">before</a> and <a href="/dateline/2012/06/elizabeth-imbarlina-juvenile-parole.php">after</a> [JURIST comments] the decision. The case was heard in conjunction with <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jackson-v-hobbs/">Jackson v. Hobbs</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder]. During arguments before in Supreme Court regarding <u>Miller</u>, Justice Antonin Scalia asked, "What's the distinction between 14 and 15? ... How are we to know where to draw those lines?" Later, Miller's attorney called for 18 to be the minimum age needed to impose a life sentence, and pointed out that most of the jurisdictions that have considered the issue in a legislative context have adopted an age 18 minimum for mandatory life sentences. He offered that those jurisdictions that permitted the imposition of mandatory life-sentences did so through a regime that transferred juveniles to the adult criminal justice system where they are exposed to mandatory life sentences, not because of the express will of the people or their legislators to impose mandatory life sentences on juvenile offenders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In September, Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/105039575/Ferguson-Death">signed a death warrant</a> [text] for Ferguson, setting his execution date for last Tuesday. Scott temporarily <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2012/12-220-ferguson.pdf">stayed the execution</a> [text, PDF] and appointed three psychiatrists to examine Ferguson. The psychiatrists issued a joint report declaring Ferguson to be sane for execution, and Scott subsequently lifted the stay. The Florida Supreme Court <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2012/sc12-2115.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court ruling based on the psychiatrists' testimony that Ferguson was sane to be executed.

<p>In June 2011 a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-rules-florida-death-sentence-policy-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida's procedure for imposing the death penalty was unconstitutional.

An <a href="http://englawpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/evans-v-mcneil-notice-of-appeal.pdf">appeal of that case</a> [text, PDF] has been filed with the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website]. Florida had briefly <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/florida-governor-lifts-temporary-ban-on.php">banned</a> the death penalty in December 2006 under Governor Jeb Bush, after the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/florida-governor-suspends-all.php">botched execution</a> [JURIST reports] of Angel Diaz. However, in July 2007, Florida Governor Charlie Crist ended the state's temporary suspension on executions.

Bensouda is on a five-day visit to Kenya as part of the ICC's preparation for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Related+Cases/ICC01090111/ICC01090111.htm">trial</a> [case materials] of former Kenyan minister William Ruto and journalist Joshua Arap Sang, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-sets-april-trial-date-for-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">will begin</a> [JURIST report] on April 10, and the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Related+Cases/ICC01090211/ICC01090111.htm">trial</a> [case materials] of Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta and former civil service chief Francis Muthaura, scheduled to begin on April 11. The four men have been accused and charged with involvement in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+and+2007+and+election">2007-08 Kenyan post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive] with Ruto and Sang facing three counts of murder, forcible transfer and persecution. Kenyatta and Muthaura are facing five counts of orchestrating murder, rape, forcible transfer and persecution during the presidential election violence in which more than 1,000 people died. In her official statement Bensouda made clear that the ICC will not adjust its calendar despite the fact that <a href="http://www.africareview.com/News/ICC+rules+out+immunity+for+Kenya+presidential+aspirants/-/979180/1539172/-/vtd6bs/-/index.html">Kenyatta and Ruto are to be significant participants</a> [<em>Africa Review</em> report] in next year's election:<blockquote>The ICC Judges have agreed there are substantial grounds to believe that the four suspects committed the crimes they are charged with and that the cases should go to trial. The four are presumed innocent until proven guilty and the burden of proof is on my Office to prove the cases against them beyond reasonable doubt. Let me stress this: the people of Kenya are not on trial; the Government of Kenya is not on trial and no ethnic community is on trial before the ICC. The allegations concern individual criminal responsibility.</blockquote>Bensouda went on to state that even if Kenyatta and Ruto win the upcoming elections they will not be granted immunity. Bensouda is scheduled to meet with top Kenyan officials as well as post-election violence victims and witnesses during her trip.

<p>Bensouda was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fatou-bensouda-sworn-in-as-icc-prosecutor.php">sworn in as ICC Prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] in June. That month the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election. In May, the appeals chamber of the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/icc-rejects-jurisdiction-challenge-in-kenya-cases.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the jurisdiction challenges in the two cases presented by the defense, clearing the way for trial. The defense lawyers had argued that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the cases. The appeal stemmed from the pre-trial chamber's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icc-confirms-charges-against-4-suspects-for-kenya-violence.php">confirm the charges</a> [JURIST report] against the four men in January. The ICC claimed jurisdiction over the case despite Kenya's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">calls for dismissal</a> [JURIST report]. The Kenyan government argued that it was capable of prosecuting the accused men domestically.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The regional courts, Mordovia and Perm, are generally reserved for <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/pussy-riot-musicians-moved-to-brutal-regional-prisons/470155.html">dangerous criminals</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] and were described by the band's lawyer as "brutal." Both have been separated from their young children, who reside in Moscow. The third member of the band, Yekaterina Samutsevich, who was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">freed on appeal</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month because she did not actually participate in the protest song vowed on Friday to take the band's case to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] on charges that the Russian government <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/freed-pussy-riot-band-member-takes-case-to-european-court/470100.html">violated the band's right to free speech</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] and illegally detained them. Samutsevich alleges that the Russian courts failed to be impartial, but stated that the band has succeeded in its goal of igniting debate about the connection between Putin and the Orthodox Church.

<p>Claiming her situation within the appeal was unique because she did not perform, Samutsevich had previously asked for a delay in the proceedings after <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-delays-appeal-hearing-for-feminist-activists.php">firing the lawyer</a> [JURIST report] that had been representing the band as a whole. Samutsevich, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were given two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. Several days prior to the trial Russian <a href="http://premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] called for the release of the band members, saying that time served has been severe enough and that any more time in prison would be counterproductive. The <a href="http://www.president-sovet.ru/">Russian Presidential Council on Human Rights</a> [official website, in Russian] has <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-rights-council-questions-prison-sentences-for-feminist-activist-band-members.php">questioned the legitimacy</a> [JURIST report] of the court's verdict and sentence. Pussy Riot's defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-ask-judge-to-recuse-herself-in-trial.php">moved</a> [JURIST report] earlier in August to have one of the judges recuse herself from the case, saying her decisions were politically motivated. Since the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-face-trial-for-controversial-protest-performance.php">beginning of the trial</a> [JURIST report], the group's lawyers and human rights groups have said the charges were politically motivated by Putin to discredit his opposition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.courts.go.jp/tokyo/about/syokai/">Tokyo District Court</a> [official website, in Japanese] rejected Samsung's claims that Apple's iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S infringed on Samsung patents in the areas of its smartphone application downloading technology and its "airplane mode" communications suspension feature. In September the court held that Apple's application downloading scheme differs from Samsung's, and in October the court further ruled that the iPhone's airplane mode function does not constitute an infringement because the technology is not a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/nonobviousness">nonobvious</a> innovation, in that a person having ordinary skill in the field could have easily created the technology based on existing <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prior_art">prior art</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders]. Apple is also currently <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealing a separate patent infringement loss</a> [JURIST report] that was handed down by the Tokyo court in August.

<p>Judge Tamotsu Shoji ruled in August that <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/japan-court-dismissed-apple-patent-suit-against-samsung.php">Samsung did not violate</a> [JURIST report] Apple's patents for inventions allowing smart phones and tablets to synchronize music and video data with servers. The court subsequently dismissed Apple's claim for USD $1.3 million in damages along with its request for an injunction to block the sale of eight Samsung products in Japan. Apple's appeal is the most recent event in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans four continents. The Tokyo court handed down its August ruling after Apple won a USD <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">$1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/jury-foreman-discusses-apple-samsung-trial-verdict-ikNjTofgRRecKM4cFXZoZA.html">video</a>] against Samsung in late August in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. The dispute covered everything from the shape and design of the competing companies' tablets and smartphones to the technology employed in the devices' software interface. Further, a South Korean court held in mid-August that the technology companies had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-korea-court-rules-apple-and-samsung-violated-each-others-patents.php">violated</a> [JURIST report] each others' patents and banned sales of several products in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

North Korea <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/south-korean-activists-send-leaflets-nkorea-122504216.html">threatened military action</a> [AP report] if South Korean activists carried out their plan to pass leaflets across the border via balloons. In a post on Friday to the <a href="http://www.kcna.kp/goHome.do?lang=eng">Korean Central News Agency</a> [official website] site, North Korea <a href = "http://www.kcna.kp/tukbo.jsp">stated</a> [statement, in Korean] that the "plan [to release leaflets] was directly invented by the group of traitors and is being engineered by the [S]outh Korean military" and that if any leaflets were detected on the North Korean side of the border, North Korea would respond with a "merciless military strike." North Korea has made similar threats in the past, but this time it had been detected that North Korea was preparing artillery and moving troops into positions along the border. South Korean police closed roads, evacuated people form the border region and attempted to halt the distribution of leaflets across the border, but activists nonetheless were successful in releasing the balloons. No military response from North Korea has been initiated yet. Activists, including <a href="http://www.fnkradio.com/">Free North Korea Radio</a> [advocacy website, in Korean], stated that they only wished to educate North Koreans about human rights abuses by their government and they did not want to back down to threats.

<p>North Korea has faced ongoing international criticism for human rights violations. In June the <a href="http://hrnk.org/">Committee for Human Rights in North Korea</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/north-korea-caste-system-leads-to-human-rights-violations-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the North Korean caste system is used as justification for the systematic abuse and arbitrary detention of some North Korean citizens and that members of the lower castes are classified as "class enemies" and are not afforded basic human rights. The UN Special Rapporteur on North Korean Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-expert-criticizes-north-korea-treatment-of-prisoners.php">criticized North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] last November, focusing on the treatment of prisoners and echoing a UN General Assembly <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/gashc4032.doc.htm">resolution</a> [text] concerning the country's human rights conditions. In March 2010 the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-body-condemns-north-korea.php">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report] condemning North Korea for human rights abuses. Earlier that month, the UN Special Rapporteur for North Korea, Vitit Muntarbhorn reported to the UNHRC that North Korean human rights situation was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/north-korea-rights-situation-continuing.php">continuing to deteriorate</a> [JURIST report]. This report came after Muntarbhorn's previous criticism, in October, 2009, of North Korea's "abysmal" <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-investigator-condemns-north-korea.php">ongoing human rights violations</a> [JURIST report], alleging that the authoritarian government was responsible for various abuses, including torture, public executions, extensive surveillance, media censorship, women's rights violations and widespread hunger.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, the three-page <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/basic_15/HB06608.pdf">Medical Parole Act of 2012</a> [text, PDF], authored by Macapagl-Arroyo and her son, Representative <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/members/search.php?id=arroyo-d&congress=14">Diosdado Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [official website], provides that the Board of Pardons and Parole "may release a prisoner on medical parole if he has been examined ... and has received a written diagnosis" including an assertion that the prisoner suffers from an incapacitating illness, a description of the incapacitating condition, and a prognosis related to the likelihood of recovery. The bill also provides that the Board's decisions may be reviewed by the <a href="http://www.bucor.gov.ph/">Bureau of Corrections</a> [official website] using the same criteria. In order for a grant of medical parole, the Board must also conclude that "the prisoner does not constitute a threat to public safety and is not likely to committ an offense while on medical parole." Given this caveat, the proposed legislation does not apply to those prisoners sentenced to death, life, or reclusion perpetua. Filed on September 26, the Medical Parole Act has been pending with the <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/committees/search.php?id=0520">House of Representatives Committee on Justice</a> [official website] since October 8.

<p>Former president Arroyo has been a target of anti-corruption efforts by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">President Benigno Aquino</a> [BBC profile], and has been in and out of the Veterans Medical Center for treatment of a spine injury. Earlier this month, an anti-graft court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-former-president.php">ordered her arrest in a corruption case</a> [JURIST report] alleging the misuse of over $8 million in state lottery funds. This was the<a href="/sidebar/2012/10/edsel-tupaz-arroyo-evidence.php"> third controversial corruption case</a> [JURIST op-ed] pending for the former Philippines leader, who <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/philippines-court-grants-bail-to-former-president.php">made bail in July</a> [JURIST report] after eight months of detention in an army hospital. In April, <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/philippines-ex-president-pleads-not-guilty-to-corruption-charges.php">Arroyo and her husband Jose Miguel pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to corruption charges before a special anti-graft court in the Philippines. The non-guilty plea came a month after a Philippines court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-ex-presidents-husband.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] against Jose on bribery charges. Arroyo faced the same charges in December when the country's authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/philippines-ex-president-faces-new-charges.php">filed a second criminal complaint</a> [JURIST report] against her alleging that she approved a $329-million national broadband network deal with the Chinese company in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks in 2008. <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-arrested-on-fraud-corruption-charges.php">Arroyo was arrested</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011 on fraud and corruption charges in the hospital before she was able to leave the country to seek medical treatment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, sole judge Marco Billi <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-italy-earthquake-courtbre89l13v-20121022,0,6778875.story">found</a> [Reuters report] that the members of the country's <a href="http://www.protezionecivile.gov.it/jcms/it/commissione_grandi_rischi.wp">Commissione Nazionale dei Grandi Rischi</a> [official website, in Italian], or National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Major Risks, committed malpractice when they understated the risks facing the ancient town, which was filled with fragile buildings and had been partially ravaged by earthquakes on three prior occasions. The controversial outcome of the decision, however, is that Billi found all seven guilty of criminal manslaughter and causing criminal injury, and, although the prosecution requested only four years imprisonment, the judge felt that the crimes warranted a harsher sentence of <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/12_ottobre_22/sentenza-grandi-rischi_a6f15a5e-1c59-11e2-b6da-b1ba2a76be41.shtml">six years in jail</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report, in Italian]. Several international science organizations, including the <a href="http://sites.agu.org/">American Geophysical Union</a> [official website], have proffered that a miscommunication of science should not subject responsible scientists to prison time, as such drastic repercussions of litigation may deter scientists from working with governments in the future. While prosecutors admitted that they did not expect a precise forecast from the accused, they argued that the scientists gave incomplete, imprecise, and contradictory information regarding the significance of the low-level tremors felt throughout L'Aquila leading up to the earthquake, as well as the potential dangers of the much larger earthquake.

<p>Italy is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in Europe and endures continual criticism related to its disaster preparedness. The <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18256214">most recent earthquake occurred in May</a> [BBC report] when a series of tremors reaching a 5.8 magnitude killed 16 people and injured hundreds of others in the Emilia Romagna region. The ancient town of L'Aquila was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7985753.stm">struck</a> [BBC report] by a 6.3 magnitude earthquake at 3:32AM on April 6, 2009. It <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/09_aprile_08/nuovo_bilancio_terremoto_abruzzo_8f2d2710-23fe-11de-a75a-00144f02aabc.shtml">damaged</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report] or completely destroyed tens of thousands of buildings, injured more than 1,000 people, and killed 308.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Noor Khan, represented by <A href = "http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website; <A href = "http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/2012_10_22_hague_in_court_over_UK_drones_policy/">press release</a>], lives in Miranshah, North Waziristan Agency of the <a href = "http://fata.gov.pk/">Federally Administered Tribal Areas</a> (FATA) [official website] of Pakistan. Khan's father was killed in a March 2011 drone strike in North Waziristan that killed at least 44 people when it hit a community council meeting that intelligence services targeted as a meeting place for militants. Khan and his representatives are not seeking more information on that particular attack, simply the extent that the UK is aiding the US in drone efforts and for the court to evaluate if those strikes violate international war crimes laws:<blockquote>As CIA and [Government Communications Headquarters] employees are civilians and not "combatants" they are not entitled to the benefit of immunity from ordinary criminal law ... GCHQ employees who assist CIA employees to direct armed attacks in Pakistan are in principle liable under domestic criminal law as secondary parties to murder and that any policy which involves passing locational intelligence to the CIA for use in drone strikes in Pakistan is unlawful. Evidence suggests that drone strikes in Pakistan are being carried out in violation of international humanitarian law, because the individuals who are being targeted are not directly participating in hostilities and/or because the force used is neither necessary nor proportionate. This suggests that there is also a significant risk that GCHQ officers may be guilty of conduct ancillary to crimes against humanity and/or war crimes, both of which are statutory offences under the International Criminal Court Act 2001.</blockquote>A UK government spokesperson <a href = "http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-139125-Pakistani-takes-William-Hague-to-court-over-UK-US-drone-policy">declined to comment</a> [<em>News International</em> report] on whether the UK is involved in drone strikes in Pakistan, although the government will defend against the suit. <a href = "http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/speeches/foreign-secretary/">Foreign Secretary William Hague</a> [official profile] is expected to appear in court to <a href = "http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2012/10/22/hague-taken-to-court-over-drone-bombings">represent the Foreign Office</a> [politics.co.uk report].

<p>Khan filed a <a href = "http://www.businessinsider.com/this-pakistani-legal-case-could-be-the-precedent-that-remakes-us-drone-policy-2012-10">similar suit</a> [Business Insider report] last month in the <a href = "http://www.peshawarhighcourt.gov.pk/">High Court of the Peshawar</a> [official website] seeking criminal action against perpetrators of the drone strike that killed his father.  Unmanned drone strikes have been a contentious legal issue. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2012/09/dc-circuit-hears-arguments-on-aclu-request-for-information-on-drone-strikes.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in September on whether to grant a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &#167; 552] request by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] to obtain information from the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">CIA</a> [official website] on its use of unmanned Predator drones. In August UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism Ben Emmerson said that the US government <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">must allow an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the legality of its drone strike policy.

At their first hearing in front of a military tribunal, the pair were convicted of using their positions as vice-president and president of the Bahrain Teachers' Association (BTA) to attempt to overthrow the Bahraini government through a teachers' strike that halted the educational process and "incited hatred" against the regime. <a href = "http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/cases/bahrain-jalila-al-salman-mahdi-issa-mahdi-abu-dheeb">No evidence</a> [AI backgrounder] has been presented that they used or advocated violence of any means.

Al-Salman was in confinement for five months but was released on bail. However, al-Salman has alleged torture while being detained.

The pair plan to appeal to the Bahrain Court of Cassation.</p>

<p>Bahrain has faced international criticism for its crackdown against dissidents since anti-government protests began last year. Last week <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Bahrain's court of appeals to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/14/bahrain-overturn-rights-activist-s-conviction">overturn</a> [press release] the conviction of human right advocate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nabeel+rajab">Nabeel Rajab</a> [JURIST news archive]. HRW contends that there is no evidence of Rajab participating in violence and that his conviction is a violation of his right to peaceful assembly. Earlier this month the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] for nine medics convicted for their involvement in Bahrain's pro-democracy uprisingAccording to BNA, the medics were working at Salmaniya Medical Complex [official website], and, during the time of the uprising, "took over the complex, detained and imprisoned kidnapped persons, and transformed the hospital to a place of illegal gathering and strikes, in violation of laws." Last month government officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bahrain-pledges-to-follow-un-plan-to-improve-human-rights-conditions.php">pledged to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] the 158 recommendations included in the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BHSession13.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> [materials] regarding human rights abuses against political opposition. HRW called on Bahrain to follow through with their promises, but raised doubts as to whether the government is fully committed to reform.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One of the men, Saeed Sedeghi, was a shop worker who was convicted on drug charges and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/iran-carries-out-merciless-executions-10-men-2012-10-22">allegedly tortured and subjected to mock execution</a> [AI report] while serving in time in Iran's notorious Evin Prison in Tehran. AI reported that Sedeghi was allowed to meet briefly with his mother before his execution and that his body was returned to his family afterward. Prior to the executions Deputy Director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme Ann Harrison contended that drug-related offenses do not rise to the level of most serious crimes that would permit the use of the death penalty under international law:<blockquote>Iranian authorities know full well that executing people for drugs offences is contrary to international human rights standards. Executing Saeed Sedeghi and possibly others in a few hours' time, in Tehran's Evin Prison, will do nothing to solve Iran's ever-growing drugs problem but will inflict needless suffering on Iranian families.</blockquote>Iran serves as a narcotics smuggling route for neighboring Afghanistan, which produces 90 percent of the world's opium. According to AI there is no clear evidence that the death penalty has had any identifiable effect in deterring drug-related offenses. Iran is second only to China in executions and reportedly executed at least 368 people so far this year, including 136 executions that have yet to be formally announced.

<p>Iran's human rights record has come under international scrutiny recently. In October a UN official on released a report indicating that the government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">Iran is torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] and threatening the activists' families with rape or death. In a report to the UN General Assembly UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran Ahmed Shaheed declared that human rights activists in Iran are being subjected to beatings, mock hangings, sleep deprivation and threats that their family members will be killed or raped. Also in October the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">urged Iran</a> [JURIST report] to halt all executions because the government has failed to provide the accused with fair trials and due process of law. In June three UN Special Rapporteurs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-condemns-iran-execution-of-four-minority-men.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran for executing four members of the Ahwazi Arab minority without providing them fair trials. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Budget Repair Bill forces most state workers to pay more in health insurance and other benefits and compels unions to be recertified each year. Judge Juan Colas reasoned that Van Hollen failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that Wisconsin would suffer fiscal consequences if the stay was denied. Balancing between the harms of the public interest and of the stay, the court favored the public interest. The court stated that public interest is harmed by the state's repeated intrusion into matters that are statutorily designated as local affairs.<blockquote>The Constitutions are the fundamental expressions of the will of the people acting in their sovereign capacity. Even laws enacted by the legislature and governor, though they may manifest the popular will of their time, are subordinate to them. Even a temporary infringement of fundamental rights of speech and association protected by the Constitutions is an irreparable harm. That infringement becomes all the more substantial when multiplied by the tens of thousands of affected municipal employees (assuming defendants' initial argument that thousands of local governments are affected is correct). Granting a stay would allow that substantial harm to that fundamental public interest to continue.</blockquote> As a result of this denial, the court's September 14 <a href = "/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-judge-strikes-down-controversial-collective-bargaining-law.php">decision and order</a> [JURIST report] ruling that the Budget Repair Bill violated union workers' rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association and equal protection under the US and Wisconsin constitutions will remain in effect until Van Hollen's <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-ag-appeals-ruling-striking-down-collective-bargaining-law.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] is ruled on.

<p>The Budget Repair Bill has been the subject of copious legal and political controversy since its passage in March 2011. In July the Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to reopen a case challenging the Budget Repair Bill because of a justice's <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">refusal to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court's upholding of the Budget Repair Bill overruled a Dane County Circuit Court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] last year that struck down the law for violations of the open meetings rule. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The order came after former Egyptian prime minister Ahmed Shafiq <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypts-prosecutors-to-probe-challenge-to-morsis-election-victory-by-opponent/2012/10/22/94f30398-1c6d-11e2-8817-41b9a7aaabc7_story.html">alleged</a> [WP report] that ballots were forged and votes were bought by current president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohammed+Morsi">news archive</a>]. Shafiq added that previous investigations into the allegations were stopped without justification by the presidential election commission. Shafiq, who left for the United Arab Emirates right after his loss in the elections, has faced <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-charges-former-pm-with-corruption.php">corruption charges</a> [JURIST report] of having misused public funds while in office as minister of civil aviation during the 30-year regime of ousted president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>]. Shafiq has argued that the charges against him are politically motivated. He has also noted that he will remain politically active and return to Egypt soon. The call for the investigation came after Egyptian authorities seized Shafiq's assets as part of his corruption investigation.

<p>Shafiq is one of the many former politicians under Mubarak's regime who are facing corruption charges. In August the former secretary for Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges. He was accused of having abused his office by obtaining real estate at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, along with seven others, <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mubaraks-sons-charged-with-stock-market-fraud.php">were charged</a> [JURIST report] with stock market fraud and using unfair trading practices and illegally manipulating the market. Hosni Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ex-egypt-president-mubarak-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life</a> [JURIST report] after an Egyptian court found him guilty of complicity to kill protesters during the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Arab Spring protests</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. During the protests that resulted in the overturning of Mubarak's 30-year regime, Mubarak ordered government officials to use gunfire and other violent measures to subdue protesters, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">causing more than 850 deaths</a> [JURIST report].

Eleven experts, comprising the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Welcomepage.aspx">Special Procedures</a> [official website] mandate-holders of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] of the UN, wrote an <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12683&LangID=E">open letter</a> [text] to the government of Colombia expressing their concern that the proposed reforms could prove <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43350&Cr=colombia&Cr1=#.UIbNwsV3jY8">harmful to administering justice for alleged violations of human rights</a> [UN News Centre report] by allowing military or police institutions rather than independent investigators to be the first to determine the existence of elements of crimes:<blockquote>We have noted with serious concern that the constitutional reform project would expand the jurisdiction of military or police tribunals, giving them the power to investigate, process and decide on cases of human rights violations which should be under the authority of the ordinary criminal justice system. For instance, although the current project stipulates that criminal military justice institutions will not have jurisdiction over crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and the crime of enforced disappearances, this detailed and specific listing of crimes - which would fall outside the ambit of the military justice system - allows other international human rights and humanitarian law crimes to fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of military justice.</blockquote> The panel offered their services to the Colombian government to help develop measures that would advance "the fight against impunity and the achievement of peace in Colombia." UN independent experts are appointed by the Human Rights Council in an unpaid capacity to examine and report on human rights issues.

<p>This is not the first time the UN has called on Colombia to make reforms affecting their government and military procedures. In August UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous people <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IPeoples/SRIndigenousPeoples/Pages/SRIPeoplesIndex.aspx">James Anaya</a> [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/coloun-expert-urges-Colombia-to-advance-dialogue-with-indigenous-peoples.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Colombia to advance its negotiations with indigenous authorities in northern Cauca regarding the military presence in the area, as well as other pressing issues. In December 2011 the representative to Colombia for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for  Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-representative-calls-for-peace-in-colombia.php">called for a peaceful solution</a> [JURIST report] to the country's ongoing armed conflict involving hostages held by paramilitary rebels. Also, in 2008, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/colombia-rights-violations-systematic.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that Colombia faced continuing human rights struggles, including continued hostage takings, arbitrary arrests, and  extrajudicial executions by the military.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Nashiri is accused of bombing the <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/special%20highlights/usscole/cole-index.htm">USS Cole</a> [US Navy backgrounder] while it was in port in Yemen in October 2000. Al-Nashiri objected to the use of belly chains while he was brought from his cell to the courtroom for the proceedings. Navy officials have <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/accused-cole-bomber-skips-gitmo-hearing-protest-133248246.html">stated</a> [AP report] that while belly chains are used when moving certain detainees within the facility, they would not have been used on al-Nashiri before Tuesday's hearing. The hearing was to determine if Yemen was at war with the US at the time of the bombing, a decision that will be used to determine al-Nashiri's status as an enemy combatant.

<p>Conducting trials at Guantanamo Bay has stirred controversy recently, as alleged conspirators of both the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the USS Cole bombing are being tried.  In September Military Judge James Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/military-judge-denies-motion-to-allow-television-broadcast-of-guantanamo-bay-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that he did not have the authority to allow media to broadcast al-Nashiri's trial. In February Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/chief-guantanamo-judge-protects-confidentiality-of-attorney-client-mail.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in al-Nashiri's case that attorney-client mail that was inspected at Guantanamo Bay can not be released by the <a href="http://pentagon.afis.osd.mil/tours.html">Pentagon</a> [official website]. Days before that ruling defense lawyers in the case of another Guantanamo detainee <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/lawyer-for-911-suspect-challenges-government-review-of-legal-correspondence.php">filed a suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the order for officials to read all legal correspondence for suspected 9/11 conspirators.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The stay was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-grants-stay-of-execution-of-mentally-ill-florida-prisoner.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] last week by <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website], but the appeals court found the stay to be an abuse of judicial discretion because the district court did not address the factors needed for such relief under Eleventh Circuit precedent. In September Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/105039575/Ferguson-Death">signed a death warrant</a> [text] for Ferguson, setting his execution date for last Tuesday. Ferguson has contended that he is not mentally competent to be executed, and in September Scott temporarily <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2012/12-220-ferguson.pdf">stayed the execution</a> [text, PDF] and appointed three psychiatrists to examine Ferguson. The psychiatrists issued a joint report declaring Ferguson to be sane for execution and Scott subsequently lifted the stay. Ferguson was convicted of killing eight people in 1977 and two in 1978.

<p>In June 2011 the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-rules-florida-death-sentence-policy-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida's procedure for imposing the death penalty was unconstitutional. Judge Jose Martinez <a href="http://apublicdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/evans-mcneil.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the procedure violates the Sixth Amendment <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/right_to_jury_trial">right to a jury trial</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. An <a href="http://englawpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/evans-v-mcneil-notice-of-appeal.pdf">appeal of that case</a> [text, PDF] has been filed with the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Florida had briefly <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/florida-governor-lifts-temporary-ban-on.php">banned</a> the death penalty in December 2006 under Governor Jeb Bush, after the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/florida-governor-suspends-all.php">botched execution</a> [JURIST reports] of Angel Diaz. However, in July 2007 Florida Governor Charlie Crist ended the state's temporary moratorium on executions. The reinstatement came before the <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/florida-panel-recommends-changes-to.php">implementation of recommended changes</a> [JURIST report], which had been suggested by a death penalty commission convened by Bush.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Treason was previously defined as espionage or assistance to a foreign state that damages Russia's external security. The bill, which was passed by the lower house, expands the definition to include acts that compromise Russia's constitutional order, sovereignty and territorial and state integrity. The maximum penalty for treason&#8212;up to 20 years in prison&#8212;remains unchanged. Critics of the legislation say the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=163478093">wording is overly broad</a> [AP report] and that it may have a chilling effect on civil activism. The bill will now proceed to the upper house of parliament for a vote before it can be signed into law by Russian <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=vladimir+putin">news archive</a>].

<p>The Russian government has been cracking down on dissent in recent months. Members of Russian feminist rock band <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI background; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">news archive</a>] were given two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. Since the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-face-trial-for-controversial-protest-performance.php">beginning of the trial</a> [JURIST report], the group's lawyers and human rights groups have said the charges were politically motivated by Putin to discredit his opposition. In July Putin signed a bill into the law that <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-president-signs-law-re-criminalizing-libel-and-slander.php">re-criminalizes slander and libel in the country</a> after  <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/putin-signs-law-labeling-ngos-as-foreign-agents.php">signing into law</a> [JURIST reports] a bill that labels all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive foreign funding as "foreign agents" and requires them to register with the Justice Ministry just a week earlier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that the law, which would block federal and state funding to all "entities which perform abortions," violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396a">Medicaid statute</a> [text] because it unjustifiably limited patient choice of health care providers. Even though federal and state funding may not be used for abortions after the <a href="http://www.nchla.org/datasource/ifactsheets/4FSHydeAm22a.08.pdf">Hyde Amendment</a> [backgrounder, PDF], Indiana lawmakers sought to remove all support to entities that provide abortions regardless of the source of the funding. <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana</a> [advocacy website] argued that not only did the bill violate the statute but that it was also unconstitutional. While the court rejected the constitutional claim, it held that:<blockquote>Although Indiana has broad authority to exclude unqualified providers from its Medicaid program, the State does not have plenary authority to exclude a class of providers for any reason&#8212;more particularly, for a reason unrelated to provider qualifications. ... The defunding law excludes Planned Parenthood from Medicaid for a reason unrelated to its fitness to provide medical services, violating its patients' statutory right to obtain medical care from the qualified provider of their choice.</blockquote>The injunction allows Planned Parenthood to continue serving its Medicaid patients pending a reversal on appeal. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/aclu-indiana-wins-appeal-planned-parenthood-medicaid-case">ruling was welcomed</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union, while Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said his office is <a href="http://www.in.gov/activecalendar/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=59823&information_id=120722&type=&syndicate=syndicate">reviewing the opinion</a> [press releases] to determine how to proceed.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a controversial issue across the US, with similar law being passed in other states. Last week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">blocked a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have defunded Planned Parenthood in Arizona. Planned Parenthood in Texas asked a federal district court last month to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/planned-parenthood-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-funding-law.php">reconsider</a> its August ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-texas-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">upheld a Texas defunding statute</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, the <a href="http://www.reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website] released a report detailing all of the <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/reproductive-rights-group-releases-report-detailing-2012-abortion-laws.php">abortion laws passed in 2012</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The determination not to act on this most recent order to stay the execution concluded a series of contradictory last-minute orders volleyed between the courts regarding the execution of 64-year-old John Errol Ferguson, which had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday evening. The request to vacate the stay of execution came from the state of Florida which had appealed to the high court after the Eleventh Circuit issued a last-minute stay. Prior to that order, the Eleventh Circuit had <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-overturns-stay-of-execution-of-mentally-ill-florida-convict.php">overturned</a> a lower-court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-grants-stay-of-execution-of-mentally-ill-florida-prisoner.php">stay of execution</a> [JURIST reports] before finally delaying the execution so that it could hear motions in the case.

<p>The question at issue is whether Ferguson, who was convicted in the 1970s of eight killings in south Florida, has the mental competency to be executed. Ferguson is a paranoid schizophrenic who suffers from psychotic delusions that he is the "prince of God." In September Florida <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/105039575/Ferguson-Death">signed a death warrant</a> [text] for Ferguson, setting his execution date for Tuesday. Also in September, following the issuance of the death warrant, Ferguson's lawyers argued that he is not mentally competent to be executed, Scott temporarily <a href="http://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2012/12-220-ferguson.pdf">stayed the execution</a> [text, PDF] and appointed three psychiatrists to examine Ferguson. The psychiatrists issued a joint report declaring Ferguson to be sane for execution and Scott subsequently lifted the stay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill provides no restrictions on abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After the first 12 weeks it provides that women must go before a medical panel and go through a five-day "reflection" period before undergoing the procedure. This makes Uruguay only the second Latin American Country to legalize abortion. Conservative opposition is reportedly considering <a href="http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n290682">attempting to remove the law</a> [Focus report] through a referendum. 

<p>Abortion is a controversial issue among predominantly Roman Catholic Latin-American countries. In April the <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp">Brazilian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Portuguese] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/brazil-high-court-legalizes-abortion-of-brain-damaged-fetuses.php">overturned a ban</a> [JURIST report against aborting brain-damaged fetuses. In March the <a href="http://www.csjn.gov.ar/">Supreme Court of Argentina</a> [official website, in Spanish] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/argentina-supreme-court-legalizes-abortion-for-rape-victims.php">rape victims cannot be prosecuted</a> [JURIST report] for seeking abortions. Last year <a href="http://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">Mexico's Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mexico-high-court-allows-state-anti-abortion-amendment.php">failed to overturn</a> [JURIST report] an amendment that stated life begins at conception, effectively banning abortions in Mexico's northern Baja California state. In 2008 Uruguay's then-president <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/dnp-uruguay.php">vetoed</a> a law that was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/uruguay-senate-votes-to-decriminalize.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by the legislature decriminalizing abortion.

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] debate.

Apple brought the suit alleging Samsung infringed on their <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&date=20110209&DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&locale=en_EP&CC=EP&NR=2098948B1&KC=B1&ND=4">patent</a> [EP 2098498] concerning methods for user input and data manipulation through a "multi-touch" touch screen with their Galaxy line of smartphones and tablets running the <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android operating system</a> [official website]. The court undertook a detailed explanation of the property protected by Apple's patent and a description of methods used by Android in the allegedly infringing actions. The court held that Samsung and Android's implementation differed from the Apple patent, and thus found that Samsung did not infringe.

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. Some commentators have noted that this legal strategy has been an effort to <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">influence the marketplace from the courtroom</a> [JURIST op-ed]. October has seen a number of rulings in various cases. Earlier this month a UK court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">Samsung did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. Also Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed Apple's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. Finally the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uk-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apples-design.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] issued by the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Samsung in an ongoing patent dispute with Apple.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After minimal quality checking, these loans were then sold to the government-sponsored entities <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> and <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/index.html">Fannie Mae</a> [corporate websites], which suffered financial losses when the borrowers defaulted on their loans. They allege that this program was called "Hustle" and was continued after the acquisition by BOA.

<p>BOA has faced significant legal pressure recently. In September BOA <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bank-of-america-settles-class-action-suit-over-merrill-lynch-acquisition.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] a $2.43 billion class action lawsuit with investors over their $18.5 billion acquisition of Merrill Lynch. In July BOA agreed to pay <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/bank-of-america-settles-bond-insurer-lawsuit-for-375-million.php">$375 million</a> [JURIST report] in a settlement with bond insurer <a href="http://www.syncora.com/?site_id=2">Syncora Guarantee</a> [corporate website] over claims that Syncora was misled into insuring toxic mortgage-backed securities of BOA-owned <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/countrywide_financial_corporation/index.html">Countrywide Financial Corporation</a> [NYT backgrounder]. Also that month a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-shareholder-lawsuit-against-bank-of-america.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion by BOA to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging BOA's purposeful concealment of the bank's exposure to billions of dollars in loan repurchase claims and its problematic reliance on an electronic loan registry. In December BOA reached a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/bank-of-america-to-pay-315-million-to-settle-investor-claims-of-deceipt.php">$315 million settlement</a> of claims brought by investors alleging they were misled with respect to mortgage-backed investments, and a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/bank-of-america-to-pay-335-million-to-settle-discriminatory-lending-claims.php">$335 million settlement</a> [JURIST reports] with the Department of Justice, relating to discriminatory lending practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He said that while the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text], which became effective 25 years ago, has made a difference, there are currently 115 cases pending before his committee. Grossman, speaking to the General Assembly while giving his committee's <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/reports.htm">annual report</a> [materials], said <blockquote>We have not yet achieved a world free from torture, but we believe that this goal is achievable, that rights and duties need to be taken seriously, and that supervisory organs with independent experts are an essential component to achieving that goal.</blockquote>He called on the General Assembly to allocate more funding and resources to address this issue and called on countries to act on commitments to put a stop to torture.

<p>Torture is a worldwide problem that the UN and human rights groups have been working to abolish. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/ai-rwanda-military-intelligence-unlawfully-detaining-torturing-civilians.php">Rwanda has been subjecting its citizens</a> [JURIST report] to unlawful detention, enforced disappearances and torture. Also this month, the British government announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-court-allows-kenya-ex-prisoners-to-sue-for-colonial-era-torture.php">allow three Kenyans to sue for torture</a> [JURIST report] they suffered in the 1950s while in detention under the British Colonial Administration. Two days earlier a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/turkish-court-hands-life-sentences-to-guards-responsible-for-activists-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two prison guards and a prison director to life in prison for the torture and killing of an anti-government activist. The UN last month also called on <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-human-rights-chief-urges-georgia-to-investigate-prison-torture.php">Georgia to investigate torture in its prisons</a> [JURIST report] after a video of the alleged torture and rape of prisoners in its capital became public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gupta was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/former-goldman-sachs-director-convicted-of-fraud.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in June of three counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud for his involvement in insider trading with hedge fund founder <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rajaratnam">Raj Rajaratnam</a> [JURIST news archive]. In his opinion, Judge Jed Rakoff discussed the "bizarre results" that can happen in sentencing, noting that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/federal_sentencing_guidelines">US Sentencing Guidelines</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] only assign two points to his main offense, abuse of a position of trust, but assign 18 points to the resultant monetary gains by others even though Gupta did not receive any monetary gain. However, he said, Gupta <blockquote>well knowing his fiduciary responsibilities to Goldman Sachs, brazenly disclosed material non-public information to Mr. Rajaratnam at the very time, September and October 2008, when our financial institutions were in immense distress and most in need of stability, repose, and trust.</blockquote>Gupta is ordered to be imprisoned by 2 PM on January 8, 2013.

<p>Rajaratnam, Gupta's co-conspirator, <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-begins-11-year-sentence.php">began</a> his 11-year prison sentence at a Massachusetts military base last December after he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-hedge-fund-founder-sentenced-to-11-years-imprisonment.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] a month earlier. Along with his prison sentence, he was given a $92.8 million fine, the largest ever imposed on an individual for insider training. He was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of 14 counts of insider trading.

EC Vice President <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/almunia/index_en.htm">Joaquin Alumnia</a> [official website] stated that Microsoft abused its dominant market position by tying in its Internet Explorer browser with Windows computers. The EC has <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-09-15_en.htm?locale=en">previously stated</a> [press release] that by supplying Internet Explorer on 90 percent of its PCs, Microsoft gave its own browser an unfair competitive advantage over other web browsers. In his speech, Alumnia declared that Microsoft failed to provide a browser choice screen that would enable users to select from a variety of internet browsers:<blockquote>Microsoft had to display a screen enabling all Windows users to easily choose their preferred web browser. This gave consumers a real choice to use the product that best suited their needs. However, when Microsoft launched Windows 7 Service Pack 1 in February 2011, the choice screen was no longer displayed. Microsoft has acknowledged this. This means that those users have not seen the choice screen in the period from February 2011 to July 2012.</blockquote>The EC <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/eu-sends-microsoft-formal-complaint-accusing-it-of-failing-to-offer-internet-browser-choice/2012/10/24/b39ecb0e-1dc3-11e2-8817-41b9a7aaabc7_story.html">plans to make a formal ruling</a> [AP report] after Microsoft presents its defense to the EC's argument.

<p>The EU and Microsoft have been engaged in several legal battles in recent years. In June an EU court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eu-court-upholds-fines-against-microsoft.php">upheld several fines against Microsoft</a> [JURIST report] for failing to comply with an EC order. Microsoft appealed the $1.3 billion fine in May 2011, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/microsoft-appeals-fine-imposed-by-eu-antitrust-regulators.php">arguing</a> [JURIST report] that the fine was excessive and that the law was unclear. In March 2011 Microsoft <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/microsoft-to-file-anti-competition-complaint-against-google-in-europe.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the EC over alleged anticompetitive practices by <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/">Google</a> [corporate website], which is <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/eu-announces-antitrust-probe-into-google-business-practices.php">under investigation</a> [JURIST report] by the EC for allegations of manipulation of search results to highlight Google's own products and services.

Presenting her <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/Annual.aspx">annual report</a> [materials] to the UN General Assembly, Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/IDPIndex.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a> [official profile] said that judicial corruption is a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12692&LangID=E">direct threat to the rule of law</a> [UN News Centre report] and human rights because it deprives people without political and financial means of their due process rights. In her report, Knaul suggested a policy of "strengthening the judiciary from within" in which governments develop anti-corruption bodies to ensure that judges act impartially and are free from political influence: <blockquote>Combating corruption within the judicial system is important in order to strengthen judicial credibility and independence. Thus, the establishment of internal and external mechanisms of accountability for judges, prosecutors and the court staff is imperative. Any such mechanisms should be developed with the full participation and consent of the actors concerned.</blockquote>Knaul also called on the international community to assist nations in cracking down on corruption and strengthening the rule of law.

<p>Last year Knaul's report focused on the need for <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-expert-calls-for-gender-equality-in-criminal-justice-systems.php">gender equality in criminal justice systems</a> [JURIST report]. Knaul said that "[g]iven the historical and pervasive discrimination against women throughout the world, we have to look at how women are represented and treated in the criminal justice system." Knaul stressed the necessity of integrating gender perspective into judicial procedures to allow women's perspectives to challenge the "traditional notions of judging and judicial authority." The report included a number of recommendations to states on how to improve gender equality in their criminal justice systems, including identifying judicial regions most affected by gender-based discrimination, encouraging women to apply for high level criminal justice positions, and providing training geared on gender equality and women's rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court determined that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.njleg.state.nj.us%2F2010%2FBills%2FA1500%2F1063_I1.PDF&ei=mHOJUILRDOOT0QHlqoCIDg&usg=AFQjCNGZtSGXzMubJ71bsUPbn--shNYvEA&sig2=AfBinI17BW3DXq3zmQA5YQ">New Jersey Parentage Act</a> [text, PDF] requires a woman in that situation to adopt the child before she can be said to be a legal guardian. Lawyers for the parents in the case had argued that the law is discriminatory because it places infertile men and infertile women in a different legal position; under the same law, an infertile man is considered the legal guardian of a child that is conceived using a sperm donor and carried by his wife. The court determined, however, that the law does not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [text] of the Constitution because the different treatment of men and women is based on actual physiological differences between the sexes. 

<p>Courts around the world continue to grapple with legal issues surrounding surrogacy. In August a judge for Australia's Queensland District Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/australia-judge-makes-first-ruling-defining-conception.php">defined the term "conception"</a> [JURIST report] as the act of getting pregnant. The definition was crucial because the <a href="http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/S/SurrogacyA10.pdf">Queensland Surrogacy Act of 2010</a> [text, PDF] requires that surrogacy arrangements be signed "before the child is conceived." In May, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/new-york-high-court-expands-rights-of-nonbiological-gay-parents.php">issued two rulings</a> [JURIST report] expanding the rights of nonbiological gay and lesbian parents. In one case, the court <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/decisions/2010/may10/47opn10.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-0 that a lesbian can assert parental rights over the biological child of her partner, reversing a <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-partner.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST report]. In a separate case, the court <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/decisions/2010/may10/48opn10.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 4-3 that a lesbian could seek child support from her former partner.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, the three-judge panel <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/sns-rt-us-usa-campaign-finances-illinoisbre89o00w-20121024,0,1952994.story">refused to grant</a> [Reuters report] a request by the <a href="http://www.illinoislibertypac.org/">Illinois Liberty Political Action Committee</a> (ILPAC) [advocacy website] for a temporary injunction to block <a href="www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/96/PDF/096-0832.pdf">Public Act 096-0832</a> [text, PDF], or "[a]n act concerning elections." The court reasoned that ILPAC did not have a likely chance of success with regard to their claims that the state law violated free speech under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII  backgrounders] under the Fourteenth Amendment of the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html">US Constitution</a> [text]. The case will now be heard on remand in the <a href="www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website], which is where ILPAC's injunction attempt was <a href="http://libertyjusticecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Illinois-Liberty-PAC-District-Court-order.pdf">originally quashed</a> [opinion, PDF] only three weeks ago. Public Act 096-0832 was passed in December 2009 and places a $5,000 limit on political contributions from individuals, a $10,000 limit on unions and corporations and a $50,000 limit on political action committees.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=campaign+finance">Campaign finance</a> [JURIST news archive] has received significant national attention over the past year, especially in Illinois. In September the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-court-upholds-illinois-law-on-donor-disclosure.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a state law requiring all organizations to disclose their funding sources, including groups that do not focus on elections. In March a judge for the Northern District <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-strikes-down-portions-of-illinois-election-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] two recently enacted parts of the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=170&ChapterID=3">Illinois Election Code</a> [text] also designed to cap campaign contributions. Illinois Election Code revisions and campaign contribution restrictions were passed in 2009 as part of reform efforts following the indictment of former governor <a href="http://www.thepublicityagency.com/rod-blagojevich/index.htm">Rod Blagojevich</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blagojevich">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 on corruption charges that included the allegation that he conspired to sell the Senate seat left vacant by US President Barack Obama.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The site said that it will release "more than 100 classified or otherwise restricted files from the United States Department of Defense" over the next month. Wikileaks said that many of the documents that will be released exemplify US "policies of unaccountability." One of the first documents to be released is the standard operating procedure (SOP) manual for <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Wikileaks founder <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/7909793/Profile-Wikileaks-founder-Julian-Assange.html">Julian Assange</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile] said of the documents: <blockquote>The "Detainee Policies" show the anatomy of the beast that is post-9/11 detention, the carving out of a dark space where law and rights do not apply, where persons can be detained without a trace at the convenience of the U.S. Department of Defense. It shows the excesses of the early days of war against an unknown "enemy" and how these policies matured and evolved, ultimately deriving into the permanent state of exception that the United States now finds itself in, a decade later.</blockquote>The US government has not commented on this newest leak. 

<p>The US government has struggled to deal with the release of confidential files on Wikileaks. Army Col. Denise Lind in June <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-to-review-allegedly-withheld-evidence-in-wikileaks-trial.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution in the case against Pfc. <a href="http://www.bradleymanning.org/">Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bradley+manning">news archive</a>] to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly withheld from the defense during discovery. Manning is accused of transferring more than 700,000 confidential documents and video clips to Wikileaks, the largest intelligence leak is US history. Manning's defense has argued the leaks did not hurt US national security, but the US Army has responded that Manning's actions indirectly aided al Qaeda. Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-soldier-formally-charged-for-leaking-information-to-wikileaks.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] in February with 22 counts, including aiding the enemy, under the Espionage Act. In April 2011 WikiLeaks <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/wikileaks-releases-classified-guantanamo-documents.php">began publishing the Guantanamo Files</a> [JURIST report], a collection of more than 700 classified documents relating to the evidence and treatment of almost all detainees held at Guantanamo Bay between 2002 and 2008. In December 2010, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-chief-criticizes-actions-against-wikileaks.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] actions by governments and corporations worldwide to cut off funding to WikiLeaks, saying it could violate the website's rights to free expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge John Coughenour, who had twice had his sentences of Ressam <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/us-appeals-court-overturns-terrorist-sentence.php">vacated by the appeals court</a> [JURIST report], refused US attorneys' request for a life sentence, stating "I will not sentence a man to fifty lashes with a whip, and then fifty more for getting blood on the whip." Coughenour imposed the larger sentence after defense attorneys conceded their client's actions likely warranted a three-decade long sentence. 

<p>This is the third time Ressam has been sentenced for his terrorism conviction. In December 2008 the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] reissued a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/millennium-bomber-re-sentenced-to-22.php">22-year sentence</a>  which was later <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-millennium.php">rejected as too lenient</a> [JURIST reports] by a federal appeals court.

The court reversed the <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/federal-appeals-court-rejects-22-year.php">judgment</a> [JURIST report] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and ruled that Ressam could be convicted and sentenced under a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000844----000-.html">law</a> [18 USC &#167; 844 text] punishing the carrying of explosives while committing a felony even if the explosives were not related to the felony offense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The patents at issue involve both hardware and software features, and include one relating to the face of the Apple iPhone and one relating to its touch-screen technology. Samsung has repeatedly contended that a sales ban on its products would limit choice and raise consumer prices in America, but to no avail. The ruling by administrative law judge Thomas Pender now awaits approval from a full commission, which is scheduled to conclude its investigation of the patent infringements in February.

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world, with multiple rulings in the last month alone. Some commentators have noted that this legal strategy has been an effort to <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">influence the marketplace from the courtroom</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Earlier this week the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">Samsung did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent for user input and date manipulation through a "multi-touch" touch screen. Similarly, only a week ago, a UK court also ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">Samsung did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. Ten days ago, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of the month, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product. Likewise and only a week prior, a judge for the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-against-samsung.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung which banned the sale of its Galaxy Tab 10.1 product.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontgun.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday unanimously <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/11/11-10959-CV0.wpd.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a ban restricting federally licensed firearms dealers (FFLs) from selling handguns to people under the age of 21. The restrictions were codified in sections of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922">18 USC &#167; 922</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], which passed as part of the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OSEC/library/legislative_histories/1615.pdf">Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968</a> [text, PDF]. The <a href="http://home.nra.org/#/home">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website] challenged the statute and related regulations on two counts: first, that the ban violates <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] rights in light of the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] holding in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>], which prohibited the District of Columbia from banning private handgun ownership, and second, that the ban violates <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">equal protection</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The Fifth Circuit found that the statute passed an intermediate scrutiny test:<blockquote>We find that the government has satisfied its burden of showing a reasonable means-ends fit between the challenged federal laws and an important government interest. First, curbing violent crime perpetrated by young persons under  21&#8212;by  preventing  such  persons  from  acquiring  handguns  from FFLs&#8212;constitutes an important government objective. ... Second, Congress selected means that were reasonably adapted to achieving that objective. Congress found that the ease with which young persons under 21 could access handguns&#8212;as opposed to other guns&#8212;was contributing to violent crime, and also found that FFLs&#8212;as opposed to other sources&#8212;constituted the central conduit of handgun traffic to young persons under 21. Congress, in turn, reasonably tailored a solution to the particular problem: Congress restricted the ability of persons under 21 to purchase handguns from FFLs, while allowing (i) 18-to-20-year-old persons to purchase long-guns, (ii) persons under 21 to acquire handguns from parents or guardians, and (iii) persons under 21 to possess handguns and long-guns.</blockquote>The judge also rejected the equal protection claim, finding that the laws were rationally related to a legitimate state interest. The case was originally brought in the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website], where Judge Sam Cummings <a href="http://ia700503.us.archive.org/19/items/gov.uscourts.txnd.199403/gov.uscourts.txnd.199403.59.0.pdf">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] the NRA's challenge in September 2011.

<p>Challenges of state gun laws have been met with mixed success. In March a judge for the US District Court for the District of Maryland <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-rules-maryland-gun-law-found-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a portion of Maryland's handgun permit law was unconstitutional because it violated the Second Amendment. Judge Benson Everett Legg ruled that the law limited individuals' rights to obtaining a permit by requiring a "good and substantial reason," and that the requirement was not reasonably adapted to a substantial government interest of public safety or crime prevention. In July 2010 Chicago citizens <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/citizens-file-suit-against-chicago-gun-control-ordinance.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the city's gun control ordinance claiming it was unconstitutional. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/chicago-approves-new-handgun-regulations.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] just four days after the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government. The regulations were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-upholds-gun-limits-in-dc.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge who cited <span class="casename">Heller</span>, holding that the Second Amendment does not prohibit regulation of firearms where that regulation will "effectuate the goal of promoting public safety."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law is designed to protect the safety and privacy of individuals with mental illnesses. The law specifically aims to protect the identities and personal information of individuals receiving care in psychiatric facilities. The law is also designed to curb the wrongful institutionalization of individuals who are not mentally ill. China has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/report-china-psychiatric-facilities-detaining-patients-involuntarily-in-violation-of-human-rights.php">criticized by human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] for the state of its psychiatric care. Among the key criticisms were the lack of laws protecting the mentally ill and the lack of protection against forced detention in psychiatric facilities. Human rights advocates in China said the new law is an important step, but <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/10/26/china-passes-first-mental-health-law/">expressed concern</a> [WSJ report] that it does not do enough to prevent abuse of the system. 

<p>Human rights groups have expressed concern in the past about illegal detention in China. In June Human Rights Watch reported that China's chengguan, a para-police organization charged with enforcing non-criminal administrative regulations, is <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/hrw-china-para-police-abuse-power-overstep-authority.php">abusing its power</a> [JURIST report]. The report indicated that although the chengguan are not authorized to arrest citizens or use excessive force, they frequently do both. In March the NPC <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/china-passes-new-secret-detention-law.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] allowing police to detain certain suspects for up to six months in secret detention facilities commonly known as "black jails." In July 2010 Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-group-urges-china-to-investigate-xinjiang-riots.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government to launch an independent investigation into law enforcement conduct during the July 2009 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=xinjiang+riot">Xinjiang riots</a> [JURIST news archive], accusing police of executing arbitrary arrests and employing excessive force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bielefeldt's report documents his analysis of global <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43377&Cr=religion&Cr1=#.UIqQl4UarcE">patterns of abuses in the area of religious conversion</a> [UN News Centre report], detailing violations in which people are either restricted in their rights to conversion or are forced to convert or reconvert to become more "acceptable" to the society in which they live. The study points out that such abuses are usually carried out with an aim toward promoting national identity or protecting societal homogeneity, sometimes officially conducted under other pretexts such as maintaining political or national security. In his presentation Bielefeldt noted that those who exercise their right to convert are often subject to contempt and discrimination and other social pressures, but that the state can also impose "insurmountable administrative obstacles" to prevent converts from living out their religious conviction, sometimes involving criminal prosecution and in a few instances capital punishment for heresy or blasphemy. Regarding the right against forced conversion Bielefeldt expressed particular concern over pressure or threats experienced by women in the context of marriage negotiations, and stated that pressure on converts to reconvert to a previous religion is an undernoted issue. Bielefeldt further stated that the right of non-coercive persuasion to convert others to one's religion must also be protected, noting some states' imposition of tight legislative or administrative discriminatory restrictions on religious outreach activities.

<p>Special rapporteurs are independent experts honorarily appointed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] to examine and report in an unpaid capacity on a specific regional situation or human rights theme. Earlier this week Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/IDPIndex.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a> [official profile] made her annual presentation to the General Assembly, suggesting a policy of "strengthening the judiciary from within" in which governments develop anti-corruption bodies to ensure that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-expert-judicial-corruption-threatens-rule-of-law.php">judges act impartially and are free from political influence</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month the special rapporteur on human rights in Iran released a report indicating that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">government of Iran is torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] and threatening the activists' families with rape or death.

A US district court found that the Texas law infringed on Planned Parenthood's freedom of speech rights, but the Fifth Circuit disagreed and <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-texas-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">lifted the injunction</a> [JURIST report] in August, holding that Planned Parenthood is unlikely to succeed on its freedom of speech claim. The court's denial of a rehearing will allow Texas to implement the law immediately. Texas <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/17802/">applauded</a> [press release] the court's decision and said the state "will immediately begin defunding all abortion affiliates." If Texas implements the funding cuts, the federal government will no longer fund the state's Women's Health Program, but Perry has promised that he will <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/17020/">use state funds</a> [press release] to maintain the program. 

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">upheld an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law that would block Medicaid funding for abortion providers. Last week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">blocked a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have defunded Planned Parenthood in Arizona. In August the Fifth Circuit upheld Louisiana's Act 490, which allows the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/fifth-circuit-upholds-louisiana-abortion-clinic-restrictions.php">revoke an abortion clinic's license</a> [JURIST report] immediately after a regulation violation, rather than allowing the abortion clinic time to comply with the regulation. That same month, a Kansas judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-lawsuit-challenging-abortion-clinic-regulations.php">refused to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state's new abortion clinic regulations after state officials asked that they be upheld without a trial. In July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-blocks-mississippi-abortion-law.php">blocked a Mississippi law</a> [JURIST report] that would have effectively shut down the state's only abortion clinic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bensouda also expressed concern about witness intimidation and the "increasing climate of fear affecting those perceived to be ICC witnesses, their family members, as well as those perceived to be associated with the ICC." Kenyan government officials assured Bensouda that they would fully cooperate and would turn over the requested evidence in time so that the deadline for the final list of evidence on January 9 could be met. Bensouda stressed that the ICC was a fair and impartial body and that it was committed to bringing guilt individuals to justice:<blockquote>our motivation is those who are indisputably the real victims of Kenya's PEV&#8212;families, women, men, children and babies who have been beaten, killed, burned, raped, mutilated, and dispossessed. For them and for the sake of all Kenyans, it is crucial to break the cycle of impunity and violence. Ensuring justice and accountability can play a part. We stand ready to do our part, but we can not do it alone, it is up to Kenyans to decide to make this happen, within a strong and united Kenya. I hope I can count on Kenyans in this joint endeavour.</blockquote>Bensouda made this statement on the last day of the Nairobi segment of her <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-chief-procecutor-visits-kenya-to-prepare-for-post-election-violence-trial.php">visit to Kenya</a> [JURIST report]. The trial of former Kenyan minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Related+Cases/ICC01090111/ICC01090111.htm">William Ruto</a> and journalist <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Related+Cases/ICC01090111/ICC01090111.htm">Joshua Arap Sang</a> [case materials] will <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-sets-april-trial-date-for-kenya-post-election-violence-cases.php">begin</a> [JURIST report] on April 10, 2013, while the trial of Deputy Prime Minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Related+Cases/ICC01090211/ICC01090111.htm">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> and former civil service chief <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0109/Related+Cases/ICC01090211/ICC01090111.htm">Francis Muthaura</a> [case materials] is to begin on April 11, 2013.

<p>Bensouda was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fatou-bensouda-sworn-in-as-icc-prosecutor.php">sworn in as ICC Prosecutor</a> [JURIST report] in June. That month the ICC expressed its desire to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the March 2013 presidential election. In May the appeals chamber of the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/icc-rejects-jurisdiction-challenge-in-kenya-cases.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the jurisdiction challenges in the two cases presented by the defense, clearing the way for trial. The defense lawyers had argued that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the cases. The appeal stemmed from the pre-trial chamber's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icc-confirms-charges-against-4-suspects-for-kenya-violence.php">confirm the charges</a> [JURIST report] against the four men in January. The ICC claimed jurisdiction over the case despite Kenya's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">calls for dismissal</a> [JURIST report]. The Kenyan government argued that it was capable of prosecuting the accused men domestically.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecutors had asked for a sentence of <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/italy-prosecutors-seek-prison-sentence-for-berlusconi.php">three years eight months</a> [JURIST report], but the four-year prison term was reduced to one year because of an amnesty law passed in 2006. Both the prison term and a ban on taking political office will not take effect until <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215">all of his appeals are exhausted</a> [BBC report]. In addition to Berlusconi, 10 other individuals were on trial. Three individuals were acquitted, including the Mediaset chairman, three were found guilty along with Berlusconi and four were released because the statute of limitations had run. Berlusconi and his co-defendants were also ordered to pay 10 million euros (USD $12.9 million) in damages. Berlusconi stated that the verdict was the result of judicial harassment. Because of the statute of limitations and the fact that the case took six years to complete and two levels of appeals remain, Berlusconi is unlikely to ever serve his sentence.

<p>Berlusconi, who stepped down as prime minister last November, has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases but has never served a single prison sentence due to either successfully appealing or having the statute of limitations on the charge expire. In addition to the tax fraud charges, he is also facing charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports] and abusing his power by having the police release her. In January 2011 the Italian Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a immunity law backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary amnesty from any charges while holding office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The state had argued that the Memphis library is not an entity of the state as defined in the law as an approved provider of acceptable forms of photo ID. In examining the intent of the legislature the court ruled that allowing such local government entities to produce voter IDs is consistent with and furthers the goals of the legislation, and ordered that Memphis library cards immediately begin to be accepted at Tennessee polling places. The three-judge panel then upheld the constitutionality of the voter ID law over larger arguments that it represents an undue burden on individual voters under the Tennessee <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/about/docs/TN-Constitution.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF]:<blockquote>The legislature has determined, pursuant to its authority to secure the integrity of elections, that requiring photographic identification will advance the state's interest in preventing in-person voter fraud. We agree that the requirement bears a substantial relation to the state's interest. ... Showing a photo ID is not a significant intrusion or burden. ... The photographic identification requirement, in the context of the statutory scheme, serves the State's interest in the integrity of elections in the least intrusive manner possible.</blockquote>The court also rejected arguments that the ID requirement constitutes an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] violation akin to a poll tax, holding that the fees required for documentation to obtain a photo ID are not tied to voting in that such documents, such as a birth certificate, have "independent value separate and apart from voting." <a href="http://www.tn.gov/sos/">Secretary of State Tre Hargett</a> [official website] praised the decision to uphold the law but announced that the state would <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/story/19922678/tennessee-to-appeal-voter-id-law-over-library-card">appeal the library card order</a> [AP report] to the Tennessee <a href="http://www.tncourts.gov/courts/supreme-court">Supreme Court</a> [official website], effectively putting the order on hold pending further appeal.

<p>The issue of <a href="/feature/featured/voting-rights/">voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remains a contentious issue in the US, particularly in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election. At least <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id.aspx">30 states have passed laws</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/T/Commonwealth/">Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-blocks-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] preventing Pennsylvania's new <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2011&amp;sind=0&amp;body=H&amp;type=B&amp;bn=934">voter ID law</a> [HB 943 materials] from taking effect before the upcoming election. That same week Mississippi <a href="http://agjimhood.com/">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] announced that his state's voter ID law will <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/mississippi-voter-id-law-delayed-pending-federal-review.php">not take effect</a> [JURIST report] before the November election. Also this month the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] ruled that South Carolina's new <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/3003.htm">voter ID law</a> [A27, text] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">does not discriminate against racial minorities</a> [JURIST report], paving the way for the law to take effect next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, filed in <a href="http://www.co.travis.tx.us/courts/default.asp">Travis County Court</a> [official website], claims that a state law that denies funding to any organization participating in the state's <a href="http://www.texaswomenshealth.org/">Women's Health Program</a> [official website] that performs abortions contradicts a provision in Texas's <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/HR/htm/HR.32.htm">Human Resources Code</a> [Chapter 32, text]. Planned Parenthood <a href="http://austin.ynn.com/content/capital_tonight/288985/planned-parenthood-sues-over--affiliate-ban-rule-">contends</a> [YNN report] that Chapter 32 does not authorize the Texas legislature to adopt the Affiliate Ban Rule because the federal government did not previously approve the Rule. In the press release, Planned Parenthood warned of the negative consequences that the Affiliate Ban Rule would have on women in Texas seeking health care:<blockquote>If Planned Parenthood is banned from the Women's Health Program, it will jeopardize health care access for tens of thousands of Texas women. Research demonstrates community health centers would have to greatly expand their in order to offset the loss of Planned Parenthood from the program, which research shows is nearly impossible after cuts to women's health enacted in 2011.</blockquote>Texas <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/about/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official profile] <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/17804/">announced</a> [statement] that the state would ultimately prevail against Planned Parenthood's legal challenge. The Affiliate Ban Rule is scheduled to take effect on November 1.

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the US. On Thursday the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined to reconsider</a> its August decision to allow Texas to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-texas-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">defund Planned Parenthood</a> [JURIST reports]. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on Tuesday <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">upheld an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against an Indiana law that would block Medicaid funding for abortion providers. Last week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">blocked a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have defunded Planned Parenthood in Arizona. In August the Fifth Circuit upheld Louisiana's Act 490, which allows the Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/fifth-circuit-upholds-louisiana-abortion-clinic-restrictions.php">revoke an abortion clinic's license</a> [JURIST report] immediately after a regulation violation, rather than allowing the abortion clinic time to comply with the regulation. That same month, a Kansas judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/kansas-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-lawsuit-challenging-abortion-clinic-regulations.php">refused to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the state's new abortion clinic regulations after state officials asked that they be upheld without a trial. In July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-blocks-mississippi-abortion-law.php">blocked a Mississippi law</a> [JURIST report] that would have effectively shut down the state's only abortion clinic.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Second Circuit affirmed a district court ruling that Argentina breached a promise when it prioritized paying holders of its restructured debt over the bondholders who held its defaulted debt. The appeals court rejected a dozen appeals by Argentina, including a claim that forcing it to repay the bondholders would lead to another economic collapse:<blockquote>[N]othing in the record supports Argentina's blanket assertion that the Injunctions will "plunge the Republic into a new financial and economic crisis." ... Argentina makes no real argument that, to avoid defaulting on its other debt, it cannot afford to service the defaulted debt, and it certainly fails to demonstrate that the district court's finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous.</blockquote>The Second Circuit remanded the case to the <a href="http://nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] for further proceedings consistent with its decision.

<p>In August the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/second-circuit-rejects-argentina-sovereign-immunity-argument-upholds-judgments.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Argentina's attempt to prevent bondholders from acquiring bank documents regarding the country's assets outside US territory, declaring that sovereign immunity was not an acceptable defense in this case. In September 2011 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/second-circuit-rejects-argentina-sovereign-immunity-argument-upholds-judgments.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Argentina had to comply with subpoenas requested by <a href="http://www.nmlcapital.com/">NML Capital Ltd.</a> [corporate website], one of the bondholders of Argentina's debts, for the collection of five money judgments totaling about $1.6 billion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

France already fully pays for abortions for minors and low-income women, but this bill would <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_21867087/france-lawmakers-pass-bill-pay-abortions">reimburse all women</a> [AP report] up to &#8364; 450 (USD $580) for abortions. It would also pay for contraception for minors from age 15 to 18. The bill will now be sent to the Senate, where it is expected to pass.

<p>Although abortion is not a highly controversial topic in France, where it has been legal since 1976, it is a very controversial issue in other countries. Earlier this week, a US appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">refused to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] its decision to uphold a Texas law that cut off funding to clinics affiliated with abortion providers. Also this week, Uruguay's president <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uruguay-president-signs-bill-legalizing-abortion.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing abortion with no restrictions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

The plaintiffs, which include civil rights groups such as the <a href="http://www.lwv.org/">League of Women Voters</a> (LWV), the <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> and the <a href="http://www.homelessadvocacyproject.org/">Homeless Advocacy Project</a> [advocacy websites], are <a href="http://www.palwv.org/files/297_12-10-19JudgeAskedtoOrderStateToStopMisleadingVoters.pdf">seeking an injunction</a> [LWV press release] against voter ID ads that they allege are disseminating false information. The ads being challenged remind people to show their IDs when they go to vote, even though the court <a href="http://96f3e697978ac0286323-859e04de993a26326fac43911e731f2b.r95.cf2.rackcdn.com/2012/275/644/todays-full-ruling-on-pennsylvanias-voter-id-law.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-blocks-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">JURIST</a> report] earlier this month that the new law requiring photo ID will not go into effect before the upcoming elections. The judge has already reduced the time allowed for the state to respond to six days instead of the standard 30 days. He said in his order that since the plaintiffs' request for an injunction brings up new legal issues, he "felt it was prudent to afford respondents sufficient time to contemplate" them. The state must respond by next week and then the court will make a ruling.

<p>Voter ID laws have been a controversial issue this election year as many states have passed laws similar to Pennsylvania's. On Friday the Tennessee Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/tennessee-appeals-court-upholds-state-voter-id-law.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the state's voter ID law but upheld public library cards as a legitimate form of ID. Earlier this month a federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-court-allows-south-carolina-voter-id-law-to-take-effect-in-2013.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] South Carolina's voter ID law but ruled that it cannot take effect until 2013. That same week, Mississippi's attorney general said that state's law will <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/mississippi-voter-id-law-delayed-pending-federal-review.php">not take effect</a> [JURIST report] before this year's elections because it must be approved by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. The DOJ last month <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/doj-allows-new-hampshire-voter-id-law.php">approved New Hampshire's law</a> [JURIST report] requiring photo ID to be used in this year's election, but voters who cannot produce a photo ID will still be permitted to vote if they sign an affidavit and allow a picture to be taken of them at the poll.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lesaka and another member of the ETA were arrested in a hotel in Macon, France, about 70 kilometers from Lyon. They were both armed at the time of the arrest, and the police also found computer equipment and a stolen car. The ETA is listed as a terrorist group in the EU and the US and has engaged in a 40-year fight for independence in northern Spain and southwestern France that has claimed more than 800 lives, according to an AFP <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gW2oUU_-53Zzl1PBoGvyKv7YTY7w?docId=CNG.adb9ff56d5c1edfae8b9a4b7e819ccb1.531">report</a>. Last October, three members of the ETA read a statement declaring that the ETA would end the violence. Lesaka is believed to be one of the members who made the declaration.

<p>Since January, 24 suspected ETA members have been detained. Spain has been prosecuting ETA members for more than a decade. In July Scottish police <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/member-of-basque-terrorist-group-arrested-in-scotland.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] Benat Atorrasagasti Ordonez, an ETA member who was wanted by Spanish authorities since 2001. Ordonez was a "carrier" for ETA between 1996 and 2001, responsible for transporting people and materials between Spain and France. Last year a Spanish court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/former-eta-leader-sentenced-to-105-years-imprisonment-for-ordering-murder.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a former military leader for the group to 105 years in prison for ordering the murder of a Socialist political leader and his bodyguard. Two months earlier a group of ETA prisoners released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eta-prisoners-call-for-end-to-separatist-violence-in-spain.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for the ETA to stop violence and commit to a truce. In 2010 the Spanish government also <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/spain-judge-accuses-venezuela.php">accused the Venezuelan government</a> [JURIST report] of aiding ETA members in a plot to kill Colombian government officials in Spain. A Spanish judge also found earlier that year that a member of ETA had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/spain-judge-finds-eta-attempted-to-kill.php">attempted three times</a> [JURIST report] to kill Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar in 2001.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/HRW_Kyaukpyu_Damages_v1%20Copyright.pdf">detailed an arson attack</a> [materials, PDF] in the coastal Rohingya neighborhood at the edge of Kyaukpyu city. HRW also called on the government to do more to end the violence and protect the rights of the Rohingya, whose civil rights were effectively taken away with their citizenship in 1982. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, detailed steps the government should take:<blockquote>Burma's government urgently needs to provide security for the Rohingya in Arakan State, who are under vicious attack. Unless the authorities also start addressing the root causes of the violence, it is only likely to get worse. ... Deploying sufficient security forces to restore order impartially and protect basic rights in Arakan State is necessary, but not enough. Burmese government officials and opposition leaders need to condemn the violence and work for lasting solutions to Arakan's ethnic problems.</blockquote>The recent violence has displaced even more people to the already overcrowded internally displaced persons (IDP) settlement camps. While the violence is not one sided, HRW reported that the Rohingya have faced the worst of it. As a result of widespread discrimination, thousands of Rohingya and non-Rohingya Muslims have been driven from the larger cities and into these IDP camps.

<p>Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently. In August Physicians for Human Rights reported that Myanmar's <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">army is still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state. Earlier that month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-myanmar-forces-committed-human-rights-violations-following-mob-violence.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar security forces of human rights abuses against a minority religious community. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-myanmar-ethnic-clashes.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about both the continued violence in Myanmar and the country's human rights abuses committed in dealing with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gbagbo had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/26/us-ivorycoast-gbagbo-icc-idUSBRE89P0PE20121026">asked the court for allowance to leave</a> [Reuters report] the Netherlands while he recovers from alleged maltreatment received while detained by national authorities in the Ivory Coast before being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">surrendered to the ICC</a> [JURIST report] in November. Gbagbo is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1276751.pdf">charged</a> [ICC arrest warrant, PDF] with crimes against humanity on four counts including murder, persecution, inhumane acts and rape and other forms of sexual violence allegedly committed during the 2010 post-election violence in which Gbagbo lost but refused to cede power. Gbagbo's rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alassane+ouattara">news archive</a>] was declared the winner of the 2010 election and is now president. The ICC denied Gbagbo's leave request on determination that he posed a flight risk. 

<p>The violence that followed the 2010 election claimed approximately 3,000 lives. In August the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-rejects-ex-ivory-coast-presidents-jurisdiction-challenge.php">dismissed a jurisdiction challenge</a> [JURIST report] by Gbagbo, ruling that the court has the authority to hear the case. Also that month ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">again postponed Gbagbo's confirmation of charges hearing</a> [JURIST report] in order to determine if the former president remains fit to stand trial. Three medical evaluations of Gbagbo fitness were submitted on July 19, around three weeks after the Chamber appointed three medical experts following a defense request. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">first postponed Gbagbo's confirmation of charges hearing</a> in June, after his lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ivory-coast-ex-president-asks-to-postpone-icc-hearing.php">asked the court more time to prepare</a> [JURIST reports], complaining that they did not have enough resources to build their case in the amount of time given. Gbagbo's original <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">hearing date was set</a> [JURIST report] in December during his pre-trial hearing in ICC Pre-Trial Chamber III.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arroyo is accused of misappropriating $8.8 million in state lottery funds while in office. The judge entered the plea for Arroyo because she <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hRQTbpFqO68qVz1kQwBB9gdC_i_w?docId=CNG.58b8c125702c4aec97e0f33f169ab032.7a1">refused to enter a plea</a> [AFP report] and her counsel stated that the charges were illegal and baseless. The Philippines Supreme Court has yet to rule on a motion from Arroyo that the charges are illegal. This is the third corruption case pending against Arroyo, who <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/philippines-court-grants-bail-to-former-president.php">made bail in July</a> [JURIST report] after eight months of detention in an army hospital. However, Arroyo was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-former-president.php">re-arrested</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month on these new charges, which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. Arroyo has maintained her innocence in all cases, suggesting the charges are politically motivated.

<p>Former president Arroyo has been a target of anti-corruption efforts by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8674853.stm">President Benigno Aquino</a> [BBC profile]. Arroyo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-arrested-on-fraud-corruption-charges.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] last November on fraud and corruption charges in the hospital before she was able to leave the country to seek medical treatment. In April Arroyo and her husband Jose Miguel <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/philippines-ex-president-pleads-not-guilty-to-corruption-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to corruption charges before a special anti-graft court in the Philippines. The non-guilty plea came a month after a Philippines court <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-ex-presidents-husband.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] against Jose on bribery charges. He was accused of accepting bribes to support the $329-million national broadband network deal with ZTE Corporation. Arroyo faced the same charges in December when the country's authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/philippines-ex-president-faces-new-charges.php">filed a second criminal complaint</a> [JURIST report] against her alleging that she approved a $329-million national broadband network deal with the Chinese company in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks in 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report is based on the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr">Uniform Crime Reporting Program</a> (UCR) [official website]. The report found that violent crime decreased by 3.8 percent and property crime decreased by 0.5 percent in 2011 from 2010. The report further stated that there were approximately 1.2 million violent crimes, 9.6 million property crimes and 12.4 million arrests, excluding traffic violations, in the US in 2011. Furthermore, in 2011 64.8 percent of murders, 41.2 percent of forcible rapes and 56.9 percent of aggravated assaults were cleared. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] previously announced that both violent crime and property crime rates <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-violent-property-crime-rates-increased-in-2011-doj.php">increased from 2010 to 2011</a> [JURIST report] based on a report compiled by the <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> and estimates of data from the <a href="http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245">National Crime Victimization Survey</a> (NCVS) [official websites]. However, the FBI cautioned that the two reports <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/october/annual-crime-in-the-u.s.-report-released/annual-crime-in-the-u.s.-report-released">cannot be directly compared</a> [FBI report]:<blockquote>Both were designed to complement each other, providing valuable information about aspects of the nation's crime problem, but users should not compare crime trends between the two programs because of methodology and crime coverage differences. The UCR Program provides a reliable set of criminal justice statistics for law enforcement administration, operation, and management, as well as to indicate fluctuations in the level of crime, while the NCVS provides previously unavailable information about victims, offenders, and crime... including crimes not reported to police.</blockquote>The DOJ nonetheless stressed in the NCVS-based report that crime was still overall trending downward. The differences from the two reports come from the facts that they were created to serve different purposes, rely on different methodology and define some crimes differently.

<p>It is the fifth year in a row that violent crimes decreased according to the UCR-based report. The trend continued from the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/fbi-reports-another-year-of-decrease-in-violent-crime.php">Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report</a> [JURIST report] released in June and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/fbi-reports-decrease-in-violent-crime-for-2011.php">Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Report</a> [JURIST report] released in December. The report for <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fbi-reports-decrease-in-violent-crime-for-fourth-straight-year.php">2010</a> showed a decrease of 6.0 percent in violent crime and a decrease of 2.7 percent in property crime compared to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/fbi-report-shows-decrease-in-us-violent-crime-for-third-straight-year.php">2009 statistics</a> [JURIST reports]. The decrease began after <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-violent-crimes-up-in-2006-for-second.php">2006</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/fbi-reports-first-increase-in-violent.php">2005 statistics</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the secretary-general reminded the international community that the UN is doing everything it can to bring about a political solution in Syria, he again called on the country's warring parties to stop fighting immediately. Similarly, Ban also repeated a call to the <a href="www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a>  [official website] and all parties to support the mission of Lakhdar Brahimi, the Joint Special Representative of the UN and the League of Arab States, who is also working on a political solution to the crisis in Syria. The Security Council resoundingly <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sc10800.doc.htm">supported Ban's original ceasefire plea</a> [press release] last week.

<p>The Syrian government has been in conflict with the <a href="http://www.free-syrian-army.com/">Free Syrian Army</a> [official website] since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence. Ban and <a href="http://www.lasportal.org/wps/portal/las_en/inner/!ut/p/c5/vZLJcoJQFES_xQ-g3gAKLpHJBwFlVNhQSJBRUIIB-fpgVRbZaDaWt5ddfU8vGgRgUh1952nU5U0dVWAPgkUoLk3LYywacra0hASLZKNrGMMNPfn-Y59j_0nvwB4yoV3czmQsR6sYLa0TeeiMbq-L0s1xPE0vVupXOag2a-hGmcpClkaK117mY3PRUsKzA-ee-NkM2Ek9_QueEe997j58cDwEPgjYP_m5jCAxbc5cKQImHgbOCxs_ZcnojSz6fSwPvpSlgiCtmsO01N1HnA9io_eitLcOeN3nXRi3TneQsaCa7ao5x7aqVEl2RBzy23JxbceeK8zW6LWscyKqK2yl5rM6rxp1HiC6v7IGZmNCdiZykw1iRjsRPrdL08-pZZFZaRfeBjQcPZ-w4ZUSXHzymFHStxTl1oo7A8a6OSXgfHK_c4tDv6LTqfYP_PKIlQ!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/?pcid=2a817e00425e2b04b9dff9c0e4251219">League of Arab States Secretary-General Nabil El Araby</a> [official website] originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-secretary-general-calls-for-syria-ceasefire-for-muslim-holiday.php">called for a ceasefire</a> [JURIST report] between the conflict's parties last Friday, notably in light of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha.

The Grand Chamber of the ECHR <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-70442">ruled</a> [judgment] in 2005 by a 12&#8211;5 vote that the prisoner voting prohibition violates Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 of the <a href="<a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/CONVENTION_ENG_WEB.pdf">Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> [text, PDF]. Former prisoner John Hirst was also awarded costs and legal fees in the amount of &#8364;23,200. After much delay the government was ultimately given until November 22 of this year to respond formally to the court's ruling, but last week Cameron declared that he would <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/28/prisoners-legal-action-voting-rights?intcmp=239">not change the law</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. In addition to filing a lawsuit for damages Hirst's lawyers are reportedly also writing to the ECHR to bring its attention to Cameron's comments. Justice Secretary <a href="http://www.chrisgrayling.net/">Chris Grayling</a> [personal website] has stated that while it is possible for the UK <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">Parliament</a> [official website] to take no action, observing judgments of the ECHR is an international legal obligation arising by treaty and the government's reputation would suffer greatly in the case of such a breach.

<p>The ECHR was established under the Convention in 1959 to hear complaints that any <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] member state has violated human rights as defined in the Convention. Earlier this month the recently freed member of the controversial Russian feminist rock collective <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot+">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/freed-pussy-riot-band-member-submits-complaint-to-european-court-of-human-rights.php">filed a complaint with the ECHR</a> claiming violations of her right to freedom of speech and that she was illegally detained and prosecuted as one of three band members<br />
<a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">sentenced to two years in prison</a> [JURIST reports] for hooliganism in connection with a "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. Also in October the court ruled that a gay man was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/echr-rules-detention-of-gay-man-violated-rights-laws.php">detained in violation of Articles 3 and 14</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/hotline/2012/10/paul-johnson-echr-turkey.php">comment</a>] of the Convention when he was harassed and mistreated for his sexual orientation while held in a Turkish prison. In August the court <a href = "/paperchase/2012/08/europe-rights-court-hears-tymoshenko-appeal.php">held a hearing on the appeal</a> [JURIST report] of convicted former Ukraine prime minister <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Tymoshenko">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Upon considering whether the Australian government could transfer the former Nazi back to Hungary in light of his status as a war crimes suspect, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/australia-court-denies-hungary-extradition-request-for-alleged-nazi-war-crimes-suspect.php">upheld a lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Zentai could not be extradited under an offense that did not exist under Hungarian law in 1944. Zentai has <a href="http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289661">not yet specified the amount of damages he is seeking</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report], and he remains one of the 10 most wanted Nazi war criminals by the <a href="http://www.operationlastchance.org/">Simon Weisenthal Center</a> [advocacy website], a Jewish Human Rights organization.

<p>The deportation of alleged Nazi collaborators has recently become a contentious legal issue around the world. Last month <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/slovakia-police-begin-investigation-of-accused-nazi-from-hungary.php">police in Slovakia announced</a> [JURIST report] their plan to launch an investigation of a 97-year-old Hungarian man suspected of abusing and transporting Jews to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> [JURIST news archive] during the Holocaust. In July Slovakian authorities announced that they would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/slovakia-to-seek-extradition-of-accused-nazi-from-hungary.php">seek extradition</a> [JURIST report] of the same man, Laszlo Csatary, who was sentenced to death <em>in absentia</em> by a court in Czechoslovakia in 1948. The country, however, abolished the death penalty before dividing into Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Also in July Hungarian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hungary-charges-suspected-ex-nazi-with-war-crimes.php">charged Csatary</a> [JURIST report] with the "unlawful torture of human beings," a war crime that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. In January <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/german-prosecutors-ex-nazi-criminal-should-serve-life-sentence.php">German prosecutors filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to jail Klaas Faber, a Dutch native who fled to Germany after being convicted in the Netherlands in 1947 of Nazi war crimes. Last year Germany <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened investigations</a> into several former Nazi death camp guards, which stemmed from the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction of John Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST reports], a former guard at a camp in Poland who was deported to Germany to stand trial for his alleged Nazi crimes. Last September, alleged Nazi Sandor Kepiro <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/accused-hungary-nazi-dies-while-awaiting-appeal.php">died while he awaited an appeal</a> [JURIST report] on his acquittal on war crimes charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1025.pdf">Clapper v. Amnesty International</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/05/supreme-court-to-rule-on-standing-to-challenge-wiretapping-law.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments to determine whether advocacy organizations which represent or work with terrorist suspects, such as <A href = "http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and the <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] have standing to challenge a federal eavesdropping law. Parties included in the suit are attorneys, journalists and rights organizations, represented by the ACLU, who are facially <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-new.php">challenging</a> [JURIST report] Section 702 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sec_50_00001881---a000-.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [50 USC &#167; 1881(a) text], which was added by the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr6304">FISA Amendments Act of 2008</a> (FAA) [HR 6304 materials]. The law creates procedures to allow electronic government surveillance of individuals living outside of the US for foreign intelligence purposes. The Solicitor General, the petitioner in this case, argued that standing could only arise if the government had information obtained through wiretapping that could be "used" against one of the parties. Further, he urged trust in the <a href = "http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_special_fisc.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court</a> [official profile], a secret court allowed to survey the surveillance obtained through FISA. The attorney for respondents&#8212;a representative from the ACLU&#8212;disagreed, arguing that the professionals involved have to temper their practices immediately and risk confidences with clients due to the act:<blockquote>[Respondents] have standing here because there is a substantial risk that their communications will be acquired under the act and because this substantial risk has effectively compelled them to take immediate measures to protect information that is sensitive or privileged. [Respondents] are lawyers, journalists and human rights researchers who routinely engage in communications that the act is designed to allow the Government to acquire. [Respondents] communicate, for example, foreign intelligence information, the kind of information that the statute expressly authorizes the Government to collect, to retain and disseminate.</blockquote>The court had not granted any challenges to FISA until this hearing, and although many expected the court to be easily swayed by the Solicitor General, reports from oral arguments indicate a <a href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/10/argument-recap-sensitive-to-lawyers-dilemma/">divided court</a> [SCOTUSblog report]. Both the <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/today-supreme-court-right-challenge-warrantless-wiretapping">ACLU</a> and <a href = "http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/amnesty-international-usa-executive-director-calls-on-supreme-court-to-allow-challenge-to-the-us-gov">AI</a> [press releases] released statements on the arguments, with the ACLU declaring: "By jeopardizing their abilities to engage in confidential communications, the FISA Amendments Act injures our clients, as at least some of the justices seemed to recognize."

<p>The court also heard oral arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-697.pdf">Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &#38; Sons, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-copyright-protection-for-imported-goods.php>report</a>] to determine whether, under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/">Copyright Act</a> [text], a copyrighted work obtained legally outside the US may be sold in the US without the copyright owner's permission. Petitioner and Thai national Supap Kirtsaeng resold foreign-manufactured textbooks in the US that were published originally and only authorized for sale in other countries. His attorney argued that as they understand the law, "lawfully made under this title means made wherever, in a way that satisfies US copyright standards," so if a copyright owner sells a product somewhere, he/she loses distribution rights over it in any other country. The respondents argued that under the first sale doctrine, also quoting the "lawfully made under this title" portion of the law, there is a clear presumption that US Copyright law controls, and that sellers must not just satisfy it: "Now, when we just say lawfully made, you know, we need something to measure, well, how do we know whether it's lawfully made? Well, you look to the rules in the copyright law. So if you just&#8212;if you focus more on the lawfully word, lawfully made, and then under this title doesn't mean made in the United States, it means lawfully made under the rules of this title." JURIST Guest Columnists Beth Heifetz and David Cooper of Jones Day <a href = "/sidebar/2012/10/heifetz-cooper-copyright-kirtsaeng.php">analyzed the case</a> [JURIST comment] and suggested that copyright protections for the resale of goods should only apply to copyrighted goods first manufactured and sold outside the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1518.htm">Bullock v. Bank Champaign, N.A.</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/11-1518-Bullock-v.-BankChampaign-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will look at what degree of misconduct by a trustee will disqualify a debt made by the trustee from discharge under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/523">Bankruptcy Code</a> [11 USC &#167; 523(a)(4)]. In this case, Randy Curtis-Bullock was the trustee of his father's trust and breached his fiduciary duty and received a judgment against him. Judgments are normally dischargeable in a bankruptcy, and Curtis-Bullock attempted to file Chapter 7 to liquidate his debt. However, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Bullock_v_BankChampaign_NA_In_re_Bullock_670_F3d_1160_11th_Cir_20">found such a debt was not dischargeable</a> [opinion] since it was created by a trustee acting improperly, although in this case they found he had acted negligently, not maliciously.

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-10189.htm">Trevino v. Thaler</a> [docket; <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/11-10189qp.pdf">questions presented</a>, PDF] the court will again consider a defense counsel not putting forward mitigating factors in defense of his/her client. The court has limited the grant to question one, and will analyze under last term's decision in <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-rules-on-ineffective-assistance-of-counsel-claim.php">Martinez v. Ryan</a> [JURIST report]. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1999833791491978026">found</a> [opinion] that Carlos Trevino was not entitled to <em>habeas corpus</em> relief.</p>

<p>In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-43.htm">PPL Corp. and Subsidiaries v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-43-PPL-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will look at how to analyze foreign taxes. PPL Corporation is attempting to qualify for a foreign tax credit for paying a "windfall tax" in the United Kingdom, where they own a 25 percent stake in a utilities company. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/PPL_Corp__Subsidiaries_v_Commissioner_665_F3d_60_3d_Cir_2011_Cour">found</a> [opinion] the "windfall tax" did not apply under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/901">26 USC &#167; 901(b)</a> of the Tax Code, because it is "income, war profits, [or] excess profits." PPL Corporation is now asking the Supreme Court to review how foreign taxes are considered by US courts: "[should] courts ... employ a formalistic approach that looks solely at the form of the foreign tax statute and ignores how the tax actually operates, or should employ a substance-based approach that considers factors such as the practical operation and intended effect of the foreign tax."</p>

<p>Finally, in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-126.htm">McQuiggin v. Perkins</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-126-26714-gustafson-07-24-12-113-pm-Perkins-Cert-Petition_Final.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider if "actual innocence" is an exception to not pursuing a timely <em>habeas</em> claim under the <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/antiterrorism_and_effective_death_penalty_act_of_1996_aedpa">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a> (AEDPA) [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Perkins_v_McQuiggin_670_F3d_665_6th_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">found</a> [opinion] that actual innocence does toll statute of limitations: "Given the Supreme Court's rich jurisprudence protecting the rights of the wrongfully incarcerated, petitioners who seek equitable tolling based on actual innocence should not be treated in the same way as those seeking equitable tolling because of ineffective assistance of counsel, confusion of filing requirements, or other important, but less compelling reasons."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ingabire was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/opposition-leader-sentenced-years-rwanda-17596900#.UI_SGRh9n8B">acquitted on charges</a> [AP report] of terrorism and promoting ethnic division and a genocide ideology, while the judges found her guilty of belittling the 1994 Rwanda genocide [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>]. The prosecutor recommended a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20138698">life sentence</a> [BBC report], but Ingabire was allegedly given leniency after writing a personal appeal to Rwandan President Paul Kagame. Ingabire returned from exile in the Netherlands in January 2010 and was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010 and barred from participating in the country's elections. She did not attend the trial to hear her verdict, claiming that the trial was politically motivated. Her lawyer plans an appeal.

<p>In April the Rwandan court ruled that the case against Ingabire would <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rwanda-high-court-rules-opposition-leaders-trial-will-continue-despite-her-refusal-to-attend.php">continue</a> [JURIST report] despite her announcement that she refused to attend further proceedings.

The Interior Ministry announced this <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bahrain-bans-protest-gatherings-amid-violence-17594988#.UI_TSxh9n8A">emergency rule</a> [AP report] to stop the persistent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bahrain+protests">anti-government protests</a> [JURIST news archive]. This represents the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/10/2012103093735935103.html">broadest order</a> [Al Jazeera report] since martial law was enacted during the uprising last year. This order will most sharply effect the country's Shia Muslim majority who seek a more significant role in the government. Although Shia Muslims make up approximately 70 percent of the country's population, they claim to be denied political and security positions. The Interior Minister explained that this rule was a response to repeated abuse of the freedom of speech in Bahrain. This new rule could complicate Bahrain's relationship with the US and other western allies. 

<p>Bahrain has faced international criticism for its crackdown against dissidents since anti-government protests began last year. Last week, a Bahrain appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-upholds-convictions-against-two-teachers-for-organizing-strike-efforts.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] verdicts against two teachers for organizing a teachers' strike early last year to support anti-government protests. At their first hearing in front of a military tribunal, the pair were convicted of using their positions as vice-president and president of the Bahrain Teachers' Association (BTA) to attempt to overthrow the Bahraini government through a teachers' strike that halted the educational process and "incited hatred" against the regime. Last week Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged Bahrain's court of appeals to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-center-for-human-rights-urges-king-to-release-their-leader.php">overturn</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of human right advocate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nabeel+rajab">Nabeel Rajab</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

If the had amendment ever passed, it would have effectively outlawed all abortions, many forms of birth control, and various treatments for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages. In February the Virginia House of Delegates <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-house-of-delegates-approves-personhood-legislation.php">passed a similar "personhood" bill</a> [JURIST report] that defines "life" at the beginning of conception. Last fall, a similar lawsuit challenging the Mississippi personhood ballot initiative was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mississippi-high-court-upholds-election-to-define-personhood.php">dismissed</a> and eventually <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mississippi-voters-reject-personhood-amendment.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports]. In 2007 the Supreme Court of Colorado <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/colorado-high-court-oks-ballot.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] an anti-abortion group's personhood ballot initiative that similarly defined a fertilized egg as a "person."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court held that even without intention of insulting the Catholic Church, the musician violated the Article 196 of the country's Penal Code. Adam Darski, member of the heavy metal group Behemoth, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/29/entertainment-us-poland-blasphemy-idUSBRE89S19G20121029">condemned</a> [Reuters report] for his action by the Catholic church and its supporters who argued that he insulted religious feelings. Lawyers and supporters of Darski claimed in response that his actions were based on artistic expression rather than intent to attack the Catholic church. Moreover, they condemned the recent decision stating it is inappropriate in a democratic society which should not restrict freedom of speech. The lower court will now decide whether Darski is in fact guilty of blasphemy charges brought against him. If he is found guilty, he is most likely to face a two-year imprisonment pursuant to the country's penal code.

<p>Right to freedom of speech is an international concern. In August <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-urges-angola-to-respect-citizen-freedom-of-speech.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that the government of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732">Angola</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Angola">news archive</a>] is responsible for undermining freedom of speech protections for its citizens. In its 13-page <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/angola0812ForUpload.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], HRW summarized recent abuses directed at activists, journalists and protesters who expressed their criticism against the government. Journalists are frequently arrested, detained and questioned for covering protests while demonstrators are denied their exercise of peaceful assembly by the country's security forces. In July HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-iraq-draft-cybercrime-law-violates-free-speech.php">deemed a draft Iraqi cybercrime law</a> [JURIST report] to be in violation of the international standards protecting due process, freedom of speech and freedom of association. The proposed law regulates the use of information networks, computers, and other electronic devices and systems. It would allow authorities to impose criminal sanctions on individuals for publishing and sharing information that is considered a threat to governmental, social or religious interests. A month earlier the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-expert-concerned-over-free-speech-in-israel-palestine.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that people in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories are severely limited in free expression, both by the official governing bodies, and de facto authorities like Hamas. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law would abolish criminal penalties for media law violations but penalize any type of criticism against the country or neighboring governments with a fine of up to 1 million Qatari Riyals (USD $275,000). HRW alleges that the country's penal code, which penalizes anyone criticizing the emir with prison sentence, and the new draft law violate the international freedom of speech standard allowing criticism against governments. Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at HRW, also noted that the new draft law with its broad provisions does not meet the level of international standard contrary to the country's announced commitment to freedom of expression. The draft law was approved by Shura Council, Qatar's legislation, in June.

<p>Protection of free expression remains a key concern for international human rights advocates. In July the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy website] stated that <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/journalist-rights-group-concerned-about-press-freedom-in-maldives.php">press freedom in the Maldives</a> [JURIST report] has been deteriorating since the resignation of former president Mohamed Nasheed. The group noted that journalists in the Maldives have been subject to police brutality and attacks by political extremists. During the same month HRW urged the government of Sri Lanka to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">end arrests and office raids of journalists</a> [JURIST report] who publish content critical of the government. In June two reports were presented to the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] urging <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-experts-urge-greater-protections-for-journalists.php">greater protection for the right to life of journalists</a> [JURIST report] and media freedom. The CPJ in February <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/journalist-rights-group-concerned-about-press-freedom.php">released its annual Attacks on the Press report</a> [JURIST report], expressing concern about increased censorship of journalists worldwide in 2011. The CPJ criticized the growing trend of government censorship, especially Internet censorship. In May of last year, journalism rights group <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/middle-east-leaders-among-annual-list-of-threats-to-press-freedom.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual list of predators of press freedom, which included the heads of state of several countries in the Middle East and North Africa. In April 2011, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">released its 2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [JURIST report], listing many of the same offenders of free press as the RSF report.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The victim initially faced charges of unlawful intercourse by the Polish criminal justice system. The ECHR articulated four violations of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/CONVENTION_ENG_WEB.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The ECHR found two violations of Article 8's right to respect for private life when the girl was hindered in her attempts to obtain an abortion, and when one of the hospitals released details of her case to the media including her personal information. Further, the court found a violation of Article 5's right to liberty when she was placed into a juvenile home to separate her from parents who ostensibly advocated for the abortion. Finally, the ECHR found a violation of Article 3's prohibition against degrading treatment when she was forced to speak with a priest, when her mother was forced to sign a consent form stating that her daughter may die during the procedure, and when she was targeted for unlawful intercourse. The ECHR awarded money damages to the victim from the government of Poland.

<p>Last year the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/europe-rights-court-rules-against-poland-in-abortion-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Polish woman who had been denied genetic testing and an abortion was subjected to "inhuman treatment." The court found violations of Article 3 and Article 8. In 2010 the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Ireland failed to provide "effective and accessible procedures" to allow a Lithuanian women to assert her constitutional right to a lawful abortion. In 2007 Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski declared that Poland <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/poland-to-appeal-echr-abortion-ruling.php">planned to appeal</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/polish-woman-refused-abortion.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] by the ECHR that found Poland in violation of Article 8 for prohibiting a pregnant woman who had a serious risk of vision loss if she carried the pregnancy to term from obtaining an abortion. The ECHR later <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/echr-affirms-rejection-of-poland.php">rejected this appeal</a> [JURIST report], reinforcing that the Polish government did not provide any procedural framework to resolve a dispute concerning whether a medical exception should be granted, or to facilitate "effective mechanisms capable of determining whether the conditions for obtaining a lawful abortion had been met." JURIST guest columnist Gerolf Hagens has <a href="/hotline/2011/01/on-november-4th-1950-the.php">analyzed</a> [JURIST comment] the ECHR's rulings on abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gbagbo is the former Ivory Coast president and an alleged war criminal. His lawyer <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/gbagbo-lawyer-again-urges-international-criminal-court-to-release-former-ivory-coast-president/2012/10/30/90c9998e-22ae-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.html">told the court</a> [AP report] that Gbagbo would not be able to leave the area and escape justice because he lacks the resources to do so and is suffering from poor health. The lawyer did not provide additional information on Gbagbo's health. Gbagbo is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1276751.pdf">charged</a> [ICC arrest warrant, PDF] with crimes against humanity on four counts including murder, persecution, inhumane acts, and rape and other forms of sexual violence allegedly committed during the 2010 post-election violence in which Gbagbo lost but refused to cede power. Gbagbo's rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alassane+ouattara">news archive</a>] was declared the winner of the 2010 election and is now president. The ICC denied Gbagbo's leave request on determination that he posed a flight risk. 

<p>The violence that followed the 2010 election claimed approximately 3,000 lives. Last week the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-refuses-to-allow-pre-trial-leave-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Gbagbo's request to leave the Netherlands for medical recovery while he awaits trial. In August, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-rejects-ex-ivory-coast-presidents-jurisdiction-challenge.php">dismissed a jurisdiction challenge</a> [JURIST report] by Gbagbo, ruling that the court has the authority to hear the case. Also that month ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">again postponed Gbagbo's confirmation of charges hearing</a> [JURIST report] in order to determine if the former president remains fit to stand trial. Three medical evaluations of Gbagbo fitness were submitted on July 19, around three weeks after the Chamber appointed three medical experts following a defense request. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">first postponed Gbagbo's confirmation of charges hearing</a> in June, after his lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ivory-coast-ex-president-asks-to-postpone-icc-hearing.php">asked the court more time to prepare</a> [JURIST reports], complaining that they did not have enough resources to build their case in the amount of time given. Gbagbo's original <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">hearing date was set</a> [JURIST report] in December during his pre-trial hearing in ICC Pre-Trial Chamber III.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI suggested this should be done by gathering information about the victims to assess their needs, ensuring that proper medical and psychological care is available, amending the law on civilian victims to cover a broad array of injuries resulting from sexual violence, and making NGO's and other victims' associations available to provide support. AI emphasized that justice for the survivors requires both prosecution of the perpetrators and rehabilitation of the victims. While the RS is making progress in the prosecution, its silence on the issues directly affecting the victims of sexual violence is unacceptable for AI. 

<p>Bosnian courts have continued prosecuting individuals responsible for human rights abuses, especially surrounding the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/675945.stm">1995 Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica+massacre">news archive</a>].

In June the country's war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bosnia-court-sentences-former-soldiers-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four former Bosnian Serb soldiers for their involvement in the 1995 massacre. In May US resident Dejan Radojkovic was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/us-resident-deported-to-bosnia-to-face-war-crimes-charges.php">deported</a> [JURIST report] to Bosnia and Herzegovina to stand trial before the country's court for his actions as a police commander in Srebrenica during the 1995 massacre. He was arrested in 2009 after it was revealed that he did not disclose his involvement in the conflict and his appeal was rejected in February. He was the second to be deported after his commanding officer, Nedjo Ikonic, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/bosnia-court-indicts-serb-police.php">deported in 2010</a> [JURIST report].

Public officials convicted of abuse of office, bribery and exploiting government influence in return for favors or payments will receive increased prison sentences under the <a href="http://www.corriere.it/politica/12_ottobre_31/ddl-corruzione-approvato-legge_0f000198-235f-11e2-b95f-a326fc4f655c.shtml">new law</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report, in Italian]. The law also <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/uk-italy-corruption-idUKBRE89T1MS20121030">imposes higher sanctions</a> [Reuters report] for corruption in the private sector. Convicted officials are prohibited from running for public office. The law also requires that local administrations create plans for curbing corruption and demands transparency with respect to local finances, requiring these offices to post budgets and public works project costs online. Finally, the anti-corruption law protects the identities of whistle blowers. 

<p>The new anti-corruption law is part of Italy's effort to renew its reputation after corruption ran rampant during the rule of former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11981754">Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>]. Earlier this week Berlusconi was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/berlusconi-sentenced-to-4-years-for-tax-fraud.php">found guilty of tax fraud</a> [JURIST report] and sentenced to four years in prison on charges that his media empire <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_it.shtml/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian] purchased television rights for US movies through offshore companies and falsely declared the costs on its taxes. Berlusconi, who stepped down as prime minister last November, has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases but has never served a single prison sentence due to either successfully appealing or having the statute of limitations on the charge expire. In addition to the tax fraud charges, he is also facing charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports] and abusing his power by having the police release her. In January 2011 the Italian Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of an immunity law backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary amnesty from any charges while holding office. The Italian audit court, <a href="http://www.corteconti.it:80/la-Corte/index.asp">Corte del Conti</a> [official website, in Italian], announced in February 2010 that the number of corruption cases in Italy had <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/italy-court-says-corruption-cases-have.php">risen by 229 percent</a> [JURIST report] over the previous year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Perisic, the only Yugoslav officer to be convicted, was sentenced to 27 years in prison and appealed the conviction in April. Perisic began his appeal by denouncing the decision as <A href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/us-warcrimes-perisic-trial-idUSBRE89T15620121030">unprecedented</a> [Reuters report], stating that never before has a Chief of Staff been convicted for crimes committed by opposing forces. In his brief, Perisic made a similar argument:<blockquote>Momcilo Perisic's case is the only case before this Tribunal of a senior officer of one  army being found guilty for crimes committed by members of a distinct army in a foreign  country. It highlights the importance of a fundamental principle of national and international criminal law&#8212;that individual criminal liability is based on personal guilt, not state responsibility. This judgement ignores the reality that relations between states are often reinforced by the provision of significant military aid, in finding Perisic's provision of assistance  renders him individually criminally responsible for aiding and abetting the crimes committed during the war. Many foreign armies are dependent, to various degrees, upon such assistance to function. [...] If Perisic's convictions are sustained, it will have a chilling effect on international relations as under the Majority's reasoning a commander of any army can be found responsible for crimes committed by any troops of any nation simply by giving logistical or technical assistance to prosecute a war. The outcome of this appeal is not only of great importance to Perisic but also to political and military leaders throughout the world.</blockquote>Perisic is seeking a full acquittal.

<p>Perisic was found guilty of 12 out of 13 charges, including aiding and abetting murders occurring during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Srebrenica">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], inhumane acts, attacks on civilians, unjust persecutions and having knowingly supplied "extensive logistical assistance" to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) and the Army of Serbian Krajina (SVK) that would be used to torture and kill hundreds of Muslim civilians. He was also found guilty on the basis of command responsibility for the inhumane acts of his officers and subsequently failing to punish them. In March UN prosecutors demanded that <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-prosecutors-demand-life-sentence-for-ex-yugoslav-army-chief.php">Perisic receive a life sentence</a> [JURIST report] for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against Bosnian Muslims in the early 1990s. Perisic's <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/delayed-icty-war-crimes-trial-of-former.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008, and closing arguments concluded at the end of March. ICTY Prosecutor Mark Harmon said Perisic was one of the "principal collaborators" of late Yugoslav president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Milosevic">Slobodan Milosevic</a> [JURIST news archive], claiming in his opening statement that Perisic "created an environment of impunity, wherein his subordinates were encouraged and did persist to commit crimes, knowing there would be no consequences." Perisic turned himself in to the UN in 2005, <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/yugoslav-general-to-surrender-to-un.php">surrendering to officials</a> [JURIST report] from the ICTY.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court, which is charged with solving administrative concerns, <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/56807/Egypt/Politics-/Only-president-can-annul-peace-treaty-with-Israel-.aspx">determined</a> [Ahram Online report] that the issues were a matter of sovereignty which only the president had the authority to choose to enforce. The lawsuit was brought by Egypt's Revolutionary Youth Union who believe that the terms of the peace accord are contrary to the interests of Egyptian citizens and that those terms should be amended or discarded in entirety so that new arrangements might be made with Israel. The issue of greatest concern to the Revolutionary Youth is the restriction on troops in the Sinai Peninsula which the group believes is causing an increase in militant groups in the area.

<p>Despite the success of a peaceful presidential election, Egypt has faced continued political turmoil since the overthrow of former president Hosni Mubarak last year. In August a lawyer in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-lawyer-challenges-morsi-declaration.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging a declaration by Morsi granting himself <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">complete legislative and executive power</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in</a>, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the dissolved Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the country's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] dissolving it due to its finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Days before its dissolution, the Egyptian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-court-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-political-isolation-law.php">elected</a> a new constitutional council after lawmakers finally <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-reaches-agreement-on-constitutional-panel.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST reports] on the political composition of the council.

Yunus Rahmatullah, a citizen of Pakistan, was arrested by British forces in 2004 and was subsequently transferred to US officials who held him at Parwan prison without charges or trial for several years. The UK <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/rcj-rolls-building/court-of-appeal">Court of Appeal</a> [official website] had granted a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> to Rahmatullah in 2011, reasoning that Rahmatullah's detention was unlawful. It also held that, because he was captured by British forces, the UK judicial system has jurisdiction over his case. However, US officials failed to comply with the ruling despite acknowledging that Rahmatullah was not a security threat, and the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/uk-supreme-court-rejects-bid-to-force-us-to-hand-over-pakistani-man-detained-in-afghanistan/2012/10/31/a0434b62-234e-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.html">order has since been cancelled</a> [AP report]. The judges concluded that the order to cancel the <em>habeas</em> ruling was lawful because US authorities believed Rahmatullah's detention was lawful and were therefore unwilling to release the detainee to UK authorities. 

<p>A similar situation took place in May, when an Afghan detainee who was handed over to authorities in Afghanistan by UK forces <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-permits-afghan-detainee-to-challenge-legality-of-transfer.php">won permission</a> [JURIST report] to challenge the legality of his transfer. He argued that he had been tortured by Afghanistan officials until he confessed that he was a member of the Taliban. The <a href="http://www.soros.org/about/offices-foundations/open-society-institute-new-york">Open Society Institute</a> of New York and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aihrc.org.af/">Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/report-us-sending-afghan-detainees-to-prisons-known-for-torture.php">alleged</a> in March that US detainees were sent to a National Directorate of Security (NDS) facility in Kandahar, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-prisoners-facing-abuse-torture-un-report.php">condemned</a> [JURIST reports] by the UN in October for "systematically tortur[ing]" prisoners during interrogations. Afghan officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-government-denies-un-torture-allegations.php">denied the torture allegations</a> [JURIST report], claiming that there was no basis for the UN's findings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

His remarks broke the silence surrounding criticisms of the regime that has lasted for decades. The rally was in opposition to a controversial election law that the opposition claims is illegal and will establish a rubber stamp parliament. Despite stern warnings against further protests, the opposition is planning another rally after riot police broke up a rally on October 21 that is being called the largest in Kuwaiti history.

Judge Marijan Garac of the <a href="http://sudovi.pravosudje.hr/zszg/">Zagreb County Court</a> [official website, in Croatian] handed down the <a href="http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/192329/Default.aspx">sentences</a> [<em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> report, in Croatian] for the policemen who had been guards at a prisoner camp and were previously found guilty of abusing those detained. Former prisoners testified that they while they were held in the Kerestinec camp they would routinely be brought into what was called the "black room" where they would be beaten, subjected to electrical shocks and sexually abused by the guards. The camp, located just outside of the capital Zagreb, housed dozens of male and female prisoners detained by Croatian independence forces from December 1991 until May 1995.

<p>This case is underscored by the ongoing pressure from the EU for Croatia to sort out corruption and address human rights abuses from its war of independence before it joins the EU in July 2013. The <a href="/dateline/2012/04/ann-eisenberg-croatia-eu.php">push to join</a> the EU has been a <a href="/dateline/2012/05/dora-rotar-croatia-eu.php">primary focus</a> [JURIST op-eds] of the nation's rulers for years. In January of this year the Croatian people <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/croatia-citizens-votes-to-join-eu.php">voted in favor</a> of joining the EU a month after the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/croatia-signs-treaty-to-join-eu.php">signed a treaty</a> [JURIST reports] to finalize its EU accession. The EU <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eu-gives-final-approval-to-croatia-membership.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to Croatian membership in June after six years of negotiations. The EU had previously <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended accession talks</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 when it felt Croatia was not cooperating fully with International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia investigations into war crimes against its former military officers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The question in the first case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-564.pdf">Florida v. Jardines</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-to-rule-on-federal-payment-for-american-indian-tribes.php">report</a>], was whether police bringing a dog onto the front porch of a suspected grow house to sniff for drugs without a warrant and without probable cause constituted a violation of the suspect's rights. The <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/">Florida Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Jardines_v_State_73_So_3d_34_Fla_2011_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] last year that this action was unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. In oral arguments Wednesday, the US Supreme Court seemed to agree, as Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy were openly hostile to Florida's arguments that the dog sniff did not constitute a search and that being on the front porch was not the same as going into the suspect's home. Justice Elana Kagan also called the tactic used by the police "a lengthy and obtrusive process." JURIST Guest Columnist Jim Harper, Director of Information Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, argued that the Supreme Court, when deciding <span class = "casename">Florida v. Jardines</span>, <A href = "/hotline/2012/10/jim-harper-florida-jardines.php">must adopt a new test</a> [JURIST comment] to determine when an impermissible "search" has occurred.

<p>The second case heard by the court Wednesday was <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-817.pdf">Florida v. Harris</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-to-rule-on-drug-sniffing-dogs.php">report</a>]. In this case, the question was whether an alert by a well-trained narcotics dog constituted sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the purpose of searching a vehicle without a warrant. The Florida Supreme Court <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Harris_v_State_71_So_3d_756_Fla_2011_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] last year that in order for an alert by a drug dog to be sufficient to establish probable cause, a police officer must present ample evidence of the reliability and training of the dog, the officer's experience with the dog and the meaning of the training the dog has received. It ruled that the dog's reaction is sufficient if, but only if, together with all of this evidence, a court determines a police officer could reasonably believe the dog's reaction established probable cause. Florida's lawyer argued that, while a defendant should be able to raise questions about the reliability of a particular dog, the courts should not impose a prohibition on reliance upon a dog's alert as probable cause unless the police officer can provide ample evidence of the dog's reliability. The justices appeared more accepting of Florida's argument in this case, and showed more skepticism toward the argument of Harris' lawyer that the police officer should be required to prove the dog is sufficiently reliable in order to rely on its reactions as probable cause. The court is expected to rule on both of these cases by next summer. JURIST Guest Columnists Anand Agneshwar and Anna Thompson of Arnold &#38; Porter LLP have analyzed the <a href = "/sidebar/2012/10/agneshwar-thompson-florida-harris.php">possible implications of the Supreme Court's decision</a> [JURIST comment] in <span class = "casename">Florida v. Harris</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-lawmakers-expand-treason-definition.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by Russia's lower house last week raises the fine for illegally using state secrets from $6000 to $16000, imposes prison terms of up to four years and <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2012/10/31/Moscow-could-tighten-treason-laws/UPI-22381351692288/">expands the scope of treason legislation</a> [UPI report] to include international organizations. Critics of the bill have <a href="http://en.ria.ru/russia/20121031/177075075.html">expressed concern</a> [RIA Novosti report] that its language is unclear and gives the government too much power to suppress dissent. The bill will now go to <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian], who is expected to sign it into law.

<p>The Russian government has been cracking down on dissent in recent months. Members of Russian feminist rock band <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">news archive</a>] were given two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. Since the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-face-trial-for-controversial-protest-performance.php">beginning of the trial</a> [JURIST report], the group's lawyers and human rights groups have said the charges were politically motivated by Putin to discredit his opposition. In July Putin signed a bill into the law that <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-president-signs-law-re-criminalizing-libel-and-slander.php">re-criminalizes slander and libel</a> in the country after <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/putin-signs-law-labeling-ngos-as-foreign-agents.php">signing into law</a> [JURIST reports] a bill that labels all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive foreign funding as "foreign agents" and requires them to register with the Justice Ministry just a week earlier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the report, "Authority without accountability: The crisis of impunity in Sri Lanka," the ICJ contends that because Sri Lanka's government has exerted so much political pressure on the judiciary, victims of human rights abuses, particularly during Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war that ended in 2009, cannot obtain justice against their abusers. The report proclaims that the recent pistol whipping of a High Court justice who complained of political interference with the judiciary highlights how <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/11/01/uk-srilanka-justice-idUKBRE8A000H20121101">violent and corrupt</a> [Reuters report] the situation has become. The report states that by failing to bring perpetrators of human rights abuses to justice, Sri Lanka has not only wronged its own people but has also violated its international duty to protect human rights: <blockquote>It is increasingly difficult, in fact nearly impossible, for people who have suffered serious violations of their human rights to receive justice and accountability. Victims and survivors do not receive redress, and perpetrators are not brought to justice. The absence of justice removes an important deterrent to future perpetrators. This situation constitutes a serious breach of Sri Lanka's international obligation to protect and promote human rights.</blockquote>The ICJ also declared that judicial corruption is part of more widespread lack of political accountability in Sri Lanka.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war. Last month nearly 500 lawyers and judges in Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sri-lanka-judges-lawyers-protest-assault-of-outspoken-judge.php">held a protest</a> [JURIST report] to express their dismay over the assault of an outspoken judge. In July the government of Sri Lanka said that it may take up to five years to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">prosecute people accused of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder]. Earlier in July <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Sri Lanka to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">stop arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report]. In November the Sri Lankan government was subjected to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. In April 2011 a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In June 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-commissioner-calls-for-international-inquiry-into-sri-lanka-conflict.php">called for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the conduct of the Sri Lankan government during its civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The specific <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/11/01/sri-lanka-government-starts-process-to-impeach-chief-justice-amid-conflict-with/">charges were not revealed</a> [AP report], but spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella, confirmed that the impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake was approved by more than 75 members of parliament. Tension continues to grow between the Sri Lankan government and the judiciary after an outspoken judge was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sri-lanka-judges-lawyers-protest-assault-of-outspoken-judge.php">assaulted last month</a> [JURIST report]. At the end of September, Judicial Services Commission secretary and senior judge Manjula Thilakarathne had publicly expressed concern about his safety and the safety of his colleagues and also said that their judicial independence was being infringed. Thilakarathne was subsequently attacked on Sunday by unknown men in Mount Lavinia, a suburb of Colombo. According to local law enforcement, one person from a group of four conspirators exited a vehicle and beat Thilakaratne with a pistol while he was reading a newspaper in his car.

<p>Sri Lanka is still struggling to establish rule of law in the wake of a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009. The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war. In July the government of Sri Lanka said that it may take up to five years to prosecute people <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">accused of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder].

While <a href="www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website], located in Richmond, Virginia, is arguing that the PPACA violates the college's religious freedoms, the school's original claim was <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/OPINIONS/MOON/LIBERTYUNIVERSITYVGEITHNER.PDF">previously rejected</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>] by the <a href="www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] in 2010 and then <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/102347.P.pdf">deemed premature</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">report</a>] by the Fourth Circuit less than one year later. Although the circuit court's original ruling did not directly address the merits of Liberty's claim, the Supreme Court's upholding of the PPACA in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">National Federal of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">report</a>] in June consequently rejected all other pending PPACA appeals. Liberty's newest claim, filed after the Supreme Court's ruling, requests an evaluation of religious freedom under the PPACA based on the 5-4 decision. Specifically, the university is challenging the requirement that most individuals obtain health insurance or pay a penalty, as well as an additional provision that requires many employers to offer health insurance to their employees. The Fourth Circuit may now require both Liberty and the DOJ to file new legal briefs arguing the claim based on the Supreme Court's ruling.

<p>The PPACA has faced numerous legal challenges since its inception in March 2010. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/eighth-circuit-affirms-dismissal-of-health-care-law-challenge.php">upheld the dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a challenge to the PPACA by Missouri <a href="http://ltgov.mo.gov/">Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder</a> [official website] and six other citizens due to a lack of standing. In July the <a href="www.ned.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Nebraska</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-health-care-contraception-provision.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by seven state attorneys general challenging the PPACA's health care mandates, particularly those that require all employer health care plans, including those of religious institutions, to cover contraception. In June the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that declared the PPACA constitutional centered on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">"individual mandate" provision</a> [text] of the act, which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, or be subject to a fee equal to either a percent of that individual's income or flat rate of $695. In his opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts held that individual mandate is not a requirement that Americans buy insurance, since individuals who choose to pay the flat-rate fee are in full compliance with the law. The court's decision resolved four consolidated cases <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">accepted by the court</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, the Sunni ex-leader and his brother-in-law were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/01/us-iraq-hashemi-idUSBRE8A00TJ20121101">sentenced to hang</a> [Reuters report] for a charge related to inciting bodyguards to attach an adhesive IED to a ministry official's car. Al-Hashemi was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/iraq-vp-sentenced-to-death-after-murder-conviction.php">first sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] in September after being convicted on three counts of murder. That verdict, like Thursday's, was <a href="http://www.iraqinews.com/baghdad-politics/urgent-iscc-issues-death-penalty-against-hashimi-his-office-s-director/">issued <em>in absentia</em></a> [Iraqi News report] because al-Hashemi has been in hiding since his <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/12/19/iraq-politics-hashemi-idINDEE7BI0G020111219">arrest warrant was issued</a> [Reuters report] in December. Al-Hashemi, who is currently in Turkey to avoid trial in Iraq, denied accusations of being involved in death squads that targeted Shia officials and pilgrims. Though he has yet to issue a statement regarding the CCCI's second death sentence, he has long argued that the charges against him are politically motivated by the Shi'ite-led Iraqi government.

<p>Al-Hashemi is the highest ranking Sunni official with significant support from people in the region, as illustrated by the thousands who <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/23/184198.html">protested the charges against him</a> [Al Arabiya report]. The ex-VP's first death sentence came after attacks carried out across Iraq killed at least 64 people. In December al-Hashemi stated that he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/iraq-vp-refuses-to-return-to-baghdad-to-stand-trial.php">not going to return to Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] to stand trial on charges of inciting violence in the country. The statement came a week after an arrest warrant was issued against him by Shi'ite <a href="http://www.pmo.iq/">Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki</a> [official website, in Arabic].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Inspector General Michael Horowitz urged the immigration courts to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/01/us-usa-immigration-courts-idUSBRE8A01C420121101">use all resources available</a> [Reuters report] to maximize efficiency. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) conducted an evaluation of the DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review to evaluate the management and legal process of immigration cases. The OIG recommended keeping track of the amount of time that judges spend on each case and allocating staff to those cases accordingly. The review produced incomplete performance reports by the immigration courts, which makes assessing areas for improvement a difficult task. The criticisms detailed in the report include:<blockquote>Excessive delay in immigration case processing can undermine the fair administration of justice if witnesses are no longer available to testify, U.S. citizen relatives die, or documentary evidence is lost. Moreover, the failure to promptly resolve cases results in aliens with unsupportable claims for relief from removal remaining in the United States longer, while those with legitimate claims for relief remaining in legal limbo for unwarranted lengths of time.</blockquote>The OIG made nine recommendations to improve case processing and case descriptions.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has became a hot button issue over the past few years. Last month the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-denies-alabama-request-to-reconsider-immigration-law.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] from Alabama state officials to reconsider its August ruling partially <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">striking down</a> [JURIST report] the state's immigration law. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in September denied a request for a new injunction against a controversial provision of Arizona's immigration law which requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In August the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on two anti-illegal immigrant laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UNHRC alleged that Turkey has gone against international law standards by denying due process rights under its <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/11/01/uk-turkey-un-rights-idUKBRE8A011S20121101?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews">1991 Anti-Terrorism Law</a> [Reuters report]. UN rights experts allege that Turkey has been prosecuting activists, lawyers and journalists, holding them without cause and blocking access to a lawyer for pre-trial proceedings. There are currently nearly 100 journalists in Turkish prison, in addition to thousands of lawyers, activists, politicians and military officials. These prisoners are held in prison mainly on charges for plotting against the government or supporting Kurdish militants. The UN urged Turkey to modify its laws to ensure that they are compatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There is growing concern that Turkey is turning to authoritarian rule.

<p>Turkey has recently faced criticism for its human rights record. Last month the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/echr-rules-detention-of-gay-man-violated-rights-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in X. v. Turkey that a gay man was detained in violation of Articles 3 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In July a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/turkish-court-releases-16-individuals-accused-of-having-links-to-kurdish-militants.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the release of 16 individuals detained on accusations of having links to Kurdish militants. Also in July the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Francois Crepeau called on the government of Turkey and authorities in the EU to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-official-calls-on-turkey-eu-to-respect-rights-of-migrants.php">respect the rights of migrants</a> [JURIST report] in the continent. In June the Turkish ruling party planned to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/turkey-to-abolish-controversial-special-courts-report.php">abolish the special courts</a> [JURIST report] used in coup and terrorism trials. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) plans to present a reform package including the proposed abolition of special courts to the country's parliament before the recess.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-820.pdf">Chaidez v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-ineffective-assistance-of-counsel.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments to determine if <A href = "/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-rules-lawyer-must-inform.php">Padilla v. Kentucky</a> [JURIST report] applies retroactively to persons whose convictions became final before its announcement. <span class = "casename">Padilla</span> held that the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] guarantee of effective assistance of counsel requires a criminal defense lawyer to advise a non-citizen client that pleading guilty to an aggravated felony will trigger mandatory, automatic deportation. In this particular case, petitioner Roselva Chaidez's attorney's advice to take a plea deal resulted in her deportation. She contends had she known deportation was possible, she would not have taken his advice. The attorney for Chaidez argued that <span class = "casename">Padilla</span> was just an application of the longstanding precedent in <a href = "http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=466&invol=668">Strickland v. Washington</a> [text] and thus the more than 10 contrary circuit court decisions that were issued before <span class = "casename">Padilla</span> was announced are incorrect.<blockquote>Well, let me&#8212;let me try to work with your hypothetical. I think what I hear your hypothetical to say is that prevailing norms change, and they evolve to a certain point where certain kinds of advice is required, which is much what this Court said in Padilla about&#8212;about deportation advice. You would have&#8212;you would not have a new rule to simply recognize that at the time that attorney gave advice, that&#8212;that Strickland was violated. It would be a new rule, I think, Justice Kennedy, to say that Strickland requires relief, even though at the time the advice was given the prevailing norm had not yet crystalized into the degree that this Court requires.</blockquote>The Solicitor General argued that the previous decision interpreted <span class = "casename">Strickland</span> correctly and that <span class = "casename">Padilla</span> created a new rule that could not be applied retroactively.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-770.pdf">Bailey v. United States</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-detention-incident-to-search-warrnat.php">report</a>] on whether police officers may lawfully detain individuals incident to a search warrant when those individuals have left the premises before the search warrant could be executed. Police detained Chunon Bailey a mile away from his home, incident to a search warrant of his home. Bailey claims his <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights were violated, with his attorney arguing, "[b]ecause individuals who have left the scene do not pose an immediate threat to the safe and efficient completion of the search, the court of appeals erred by permitting their detention absent probable cause or even individualized suspicion," citing <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=837525223284584585&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Michigan v. Summers</a> [text]. The Solicitor General denied this understanding of <span class = "casename">Summers</span>: "So let me be very clear. In the government's view, <span class = "casename">Summers</span> is about current and recent  occupants, people whom police, when they are executing the warrant, find at the home or see leaving the home in the process of executing a warrant. And the question here is do the justifications apply equally as a departing occupant  steps away from the home and onto a sidewalk, a yard, a couple blocks away. And I think my friend's answer to that has a wonderfully abstract quality to it that doesn't engage any of the realities on the ground. [...]  The justifications for detention apply equally to departing occupants when they are seen by officers leaving in the process of executing the  warrant. [...] [T]he government is not contending that other connections to the residence, other than that kind of observed connection by the officers, could justify a detention under Summers."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The same court had issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-court-reduces-sentence-for-khodorkovsky-partner.php?edition=world">similar sentence reduction for Lebedev in August</a> [JURIST report], but the ruling was struck down and the court was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/01/us-russia-khodorkovsky-lebedev-idUSBRE8A012Y20121101">asked to reconsider</a> [Reuters report]. Lawyers for Khodorkovsky said that they will seek a similar sentence reduction for their client. Khodorkovsky has denied all the charges and maintains that he was falsely convicted as retribution for funding opposition parties during a former presidency of current <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">President Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile].

<p>In July a senior Russian judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-judge-orders-court-review-of-khodorkovsky-appeal.php">ordered a court to review</a> [JURIST report] Khodorkovsky's appeal. Opposition leaders and other groups have shown skepticism about the validity of Khodorkovsky's sentence. In December the Russia Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights under President Dmitry Medvedev called for the prosecutor general to petition to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/russia-rights-council-condemns-khodorkovsky-conviction.php">annul the conviction</a> [JURIST report]. Describing the verdict as fictitious, council member and former Constitutional Court judge, Tamara Morshchakova, noted the council found neither evidence nor substance to the charges brought against Khodorkovsky in the second trial. The council's decisions are non-binding and have seldom elicited action from Russian authorities. In July the council urged amnesty for economic crimes in a meeting with Medvedev that would include amnesty for the crimes of Khodorkovsky. Last year former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/%22">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister Vladimir Putin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the Communist Party without first getting approval to do so from the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In August Pre-Trial Chamber I <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">postponed Gbagbo's confirmation of charges hearing</a> [JURIST report] in order to determine if the former president remains fit for trial. Three medical evaluations of Gbagbo's fitness were submitted on July 19, around three weeks after the Chamber appointed three medical experts following a defense request. The court-appointed panel of experts who examined Gbagbo determined that he was healthy enough to take part in the proceedings:<blockquote>As indicated above, the Chamber considers that Mr Gbagbo is not physically unfit to take part in the proceedings against him. ... The Chamber ... bases its conclusions on Mr Gbagbo's mental fitness mainly on the written report and testimony of Dr Lamothe, which establish that Mr Gbagbo possesses the capacities to understand the charges against him, as well as the conduct and the possible consequences of proceedings against him, and is capable of giving instructions to counsel as well as of making a statement.</blockquote>Gbagbo is <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1276751.pdf">charged</a> [ICC arrest warrant, PDF] with crimes against humanity on four counts including murder, persecution, inhumane acts and rape and other forms of sexual violence allegedly committed during the 2010 post-election violence in which Gbagbo lost but refused to cede power. Gbagbo's rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alassane+ouattara">news archive</a>] was declared the winner of the 2010 election and is now president. 

<p>The violence that followed the 2010 election claimed approximately 3,000 lives. Earlier this week the ICC denied Gbagbo's motion <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-refuses-to-allow-pre-trial-leave-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">asking the court for allowance to leave</a> the Netherlands while he recovers from alleged maltreatment received while detained by national authorities in the Ivory Coast before being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">surrendered to the ICC</a> [JURIST reports] in November. The court denied Gbagbo's leave request upon a determination that he posed a flight risk. In August the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-rejects-ex-ivory-coast-presidents-jurisdiction-challenge.php">dismissed a jurisdiction challenge</a> [JURIST report] by Gbagbo, ruling that the court has the authority to hear the case. Also that month ICC  The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">first postponed Gbagbo's confirmation of charges hearing</a> in June, after his lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ivory-coast-ex-president-asks-to-postpone-icc-hearing.php">asked the court more time to prepare</a> [JURIST reports], complaining that they did not have enough resources to build their case in the amount of time given. Gbagbo's original <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">hearing date was set</a> [JURIST report] in December during his pre-trial hearing in ICC Pre-Trial Chamber III.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government filed the lawsuit last month, alleging that Wells Fargo deliberately concealed the nature of mortgages that were insured by the federal government, ultimately costing the government hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance claims. Wells Fargo alleges that the government's lawsuit was a violation of a <a href="http://www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com/">$25 billion settlement agreement</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/doj-hud-state-ags-file-foreclosure-settlement-in-federal-court.php">report</a>] reached earlier this year to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses.

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wells+fargo">Wells Fargo</a> [JURIST news archive] has been involved in many legal battles recently. In August the company was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sec-orders-wells-fargo-to-pay-65-million-for-improperly-selling-risky-mortgages.php">assessed a $6.5 million fine</a> [JURIST report] by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for improperly selling high-risk mortgage securities to investors during the housing market crash in 200. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed a lawsuit against several banks, including Wells Fargo, that <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-atm-fee-price-fixing-suit.php">accused the banks of price-fixing</a> [JURIST report]. In March the SEC <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/SEC-files-subpoena-enforcement-action-against-Wells-Fargo.php">filed a subpoena enforcement action</a> [JURIST report] against Wells Fargo to force the company to hand over documents connected to the company's sale of nearly $60 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities to investors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill's stated purpose is to <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/internet-restriction-law-comes-on-line/470892.html">block access</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] to child pornography and the encouragement of drug use or suicide. <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy website] <a href="http://en.rsf.org/russia-internet-access-barred-as-wave-of-01-11-2012,43627.html">criticized</a> [press release] the law, however, because of its vague definition of what content is banned and the unclear process of how websites are chosen to be blacklisted. Under the law, an undefined and anonymous group of experts picks which websites are blacklisted and an entire website can be banned if even a single page has material deemed to be offensive. Individuals can check which websites are banned on a <a href="http://zapret-info.gov.ru/">government website</a> [materials, in Russian]. RSF also expressed concerns that this law was just a single part of a series of legislation designed to restrict the right of freedom of information and called on the Russian <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] to halt its attempts to stop the dissemination of information.

<p>Internet freedom remains a controversial issue around the world. The UN Human Rights Council in July passed its first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">resolution to protect the free speech</a> [JURIST report] of individuals online. The resolution was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, which have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom. In June the Chinese Ministry of Information and Technology revealed its <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/china-government-proposes-new-regulations-restricting-internet-use.php">proposed changes to Chinese Internet law</a> [JURIST report] that seek to limit the ability of users to post anonymous comments on micro-blogs and forums. A Bangkok criminal court in May <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/thailand-court-sentences-webmaster-under-royal-insult-law.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Chiranuch Premchaiporn, webmaster of independent Internet news site Prachatai, to an eight-month suspended sentence for failing to delete defamatory comments against Thailand's royal family. Earlier that month, a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/netherlands-court-orders-internet-providers-to-block-file-sharing-website.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Internet service providers in the Netherlands to block the file-sharing website The Pirate Bay or else pay a fine of USD $12,750 per day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Syrian rebels killed 28 government soldiers in attack around the town of Saraqeb on Thursday. The video appears to depict the rebels <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/02/us-syria-un-idUSBRE8A10W120121102">executing</a> [Reuters report] some of the soldiers after they had surrendered. The UN official stated that once the soldiers surrendered they appeared to no longer be combatants, thus executing them was a war crime. The UN called for an investigation into the executions and for the offenders to be prosecuted. An estimated more than 32,000 people have been killed since the Syrian rebellion began.

<p>The Syrian government has been in conflict with the <a href="http://www.free-syrian-army.com/">Free Syrian Army</a> [official website] since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence.

The coalition, led by the <a href = "http://www.aha.org/">American Hospital Association</a> (AHA) [advocacy website; <a href = "http://www.aha.org/advocacy-issues/rac/index.shtml">case backgrounder</a>], alleges that <A href = "http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/recovery-audit-program/index.html?redirect=/RAC/">Recovery Audit Contractors</a> (RAC) [official profile], private contractors that assess overpayment and underpayments in Medicare reimbursements, are encouraged to prevent hospitals from obtaining appropriate reimbursements. The AHA argues that because RACs&#8212;which are managed by four private corporations that are then assigned to hospitals based on regional location&#8212;are paid on contingency fees they have a vested interest in denying funding. The complaint cites several examples where an RAC admitted that the patient's treatment was necessary, but should have been provided on an outpatient basis, and thus the hospital is denied reimbursement or expected to return previous reimbursements.<blockquote>The RACs are frequently wrong in their assertions about what a physician, confronted with a patient in need of medical treatment, should have done months or years earlier. Indeed, hospitals report that when they pursue appeals through the administrative appeals process&#8212;an expensive and burdensome exercise&#8212;they are successful in overturning RAC denials <em>75 percent</em> of the time. Despite this alarming error rate, when a RAC determines that a provider was paid for inpatient hospital services but that the patient in question should have been treated as an outpatient, [Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services] takes back the entire Part A payment. Moreover, CMS takes the position that once an inpatient claim that was paid under Medicare Part A is later&#8212;usually years later&#8212;denied, the hospital cannot receive Medicare Part B payment except for a few ancillary services. As a result, when a RAC concludes that a hospital should have provided items and services on an outpatient, rather than an inpatient, basis, the hospital ends up receiving little if any reimbursement for reasonable and medically necessary items and services provided. The RACs fare significantly better. They keep a contingency percentage&#8212;9 percent to 12.5 percent&#8212;of the entire Part A payment.</blockquote>The <a href = "http://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services</a> (CMS) [official website] <a href = "http://news.yahoo.com/hospitals-sue-government-over-private-medicare-audits-180842794.html">declined to comment</a> [Reuters report] on the suit.

<p>RACs were made permanent through the <a href = "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-109publ432/html/PLAW-109publ432.htm">Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006</a> [text] and were controversial at the time of enactment. RACs have a three-year lookback period and are the only Medicare audit option for hospitals in all 50 states. They were <a href = "http://www.cms.gov/apps/media/press/factsheet.asp?Counter=3292&intNumPerPage=10&checkDate=&checkKey=&srchType=1&numDays=3500&srchOpt=0&srchData=&keywordType=All&chkNewsType=6&intPage=&showAll=&pYear=&year=&desc=&cboOrder=date">implemented in 2008</a> [press release], with the CMS describing their goal as "to identify improper payments made on claims of health care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries." In the CMS's <a href = "http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Monitoring-Programs/Recovery-Audit-Program/Downloads/FY2010ReportCongress.pdf">2010 report to Congress</a> [pdf] it determined that RACs had "identified and corrected $92.3 million in combined overpayments and underpayments," with 82 percent being overpayments that were returned to the <A href = "http://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11396.pdf">Medicare Trust Fund</a> [Medicare backgrounder, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay expressed concern that the Chinese government is suppressing Tibetans' freedom of expression and that the government is using excessive force against peaceful protestors. Pillay also urged Tibetans to not resort to self-immolation or other extreme protest measures. In the press release, Pillay emphasized that mutual understanding, rather than force, is needed to ensure peace in Tibet: <blockquote>Social stability in Tibet will never be achieved through heavy security measures and suppression of human rights. Deep underlying issues need to be addressed, and I call on the Government to seriously consider the recommendations made to it by various international human rights bodies, as well as to avail itself of the expert advice being offered by the UN's independent experts on human rights.</blockquote> Pillay <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43399&Cr=China&Cr1=#.UJUknoVxs7A">suggested as a remedial measure</a> [UN News Centre report] that China allow independent monitors to assess the situation in Tibet.

<p>China has long imposed rigid restrictions on Tibet. In February <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/human-rights-organization-demands-china-release-tibet-prisoners.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that China release Tibetan prisoners who were forced into re-education camps. In November 2011, the UN formally <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-concerned-with-china-restrictions-on-Tibet.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over China's treatment of Tibet. In June 2011, concern over an influx of missing persons prompted a UN rights body to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-demands-china-report-on-missing-persons.php">demand a report on disappearances</a> [JURIST report]. That same month, the US requested China <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">release peaceful protesters</a> [JURIST report] arrested in Tiananmen Square. In July of 2010, HRW published a report alleging <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-used-excessive-force-in-suppressing-tibet-protesters-hrw.php">China violated international law</a> [JURIST report] in its treatment of Tibetan protesters. <a href="/hotline/2009/05/secrecy-in-chinas-trials-of-tibetan.php">Secrecy in China's judicial system</a> [JURIST comment] often raises human rights concern over prisoners being held there.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pennsylvania has been running ads that say "Show It" with much smaller letters that read "If you have it." Rights groups such as the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.advancementproject.org/">Advancement Project</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/Petition101912.pdf">argued before the court</a> [petition, PDF] that the advertisements are an attempt to mislead and confuse voters. Judge Robert Simpson, who enjoined the voter ID law on October 2, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/02/us-usa-campaign-pennsylvania-idUSBRE8A115L20121102">proclaimed</a> [Reuters report] however that the ad campaign is not intended to mislead, but instead is an "education effort" by the state. Pennsylvania voters are not required to show ID at the polls on November 6.

<p>Pennsylvania's voter ID law has been the subject of much legal controversy. Last week the Commonwealth Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pennsylvania-judge-rejects-request-for-expedited-ruling-on-voter-id-ads.php">rejected a request</a> [JURIST report] to expedite a challenge to the state's advertisements of the law. Two weeks ago JURIST guest columnist Sara Rose <a href="/hotline/2012/10/sarah-rose-pa-voter-id.php">opined</a> [JURIST comment] that the Commonwealth Court sent mixed messages when it enjoined the voter ID law from being implemented before the November 6 election but allowed state officials to ask for ID at the polls. The Commonwealth Court blocked the law after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pennsylvania-supreme-court-remands-voter-id-case-to-lower-court.php">vacated</a> an <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pennsylvania-judge-refuses-to-block-voter-id-law.php">earlier decision</a> [JURIST reports] by the  Commonwealth Court to uphold the state's new voter identification law and remanded for further consideration.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The city currently has only 1,700 officers, and the 500 who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mayor-of-mexicos-acapulco-resort-says-500-police-officers-to-be-fired-because-of-corruption/2012/11/02/94b10aae-2557-11e2-92f8-7f9c4daf276a_story.html">failed the test</a> [AP report] will be fired in January.

Acapulco is one of Mexico's top cities for tourism and has a population of more than 800,000 people.

<p>Combating issues with police corruption has been an ongoing struggle for the Mexican government. Last year, Mexico's National Human Rights Commission <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mexico-human-rights-body-alleges-regular-police-misconduct.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] describing a "systematic pattern" of illegal police activity in conducting searches for drugs.

The alleged corruption is tied to the government's efforts to combat a drug trade that has been the cause of an estimated <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/world/americas/mexico-updates-drug-war-death-toll-but-critics-dispute-data.html">47,515 deaths</a> [NYTimes report] in the country since 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DPRK, better known as North Korea, has struggled with securing its citizens' human rights, with no significant improvement since Kim Jong-Un <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-expert-calls-on-new-north-korea-leaders-to-address-human-rights-concerns.php">became the new leader</a> [JURIST report] earlier this year. Darusman expressed concern that the Jong-un continues to focus on funding the military before other priorities.<blockquote>He was also wary that Mr. Kim had declared that his first, second and third priorities were to strengthen the nation&#8217;s military. Moreover, the slow economic growth there, coupled with the military-first policy, was detrimental to its people. It was also concerning that the freedom of expression was restricted and some provisions of its criminal code were not in line with the international standards, Mr. Darusman said.  On the issue of abduction of Japanese and other foreign nationals, regrettably, there had been no further developments. He also noted that his report included a set of recommendations, which, among others, urged the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to ensure protection and promotion of human rights. His report also pressed the Government to cooperate with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to rethink its &#8220;military-first&#8221; policy and to allocate more resources to improving living standards.</blockquote>North Korea's UN delegate, Kim Song, <a href = "http://www.brecorder.com/general-news/172/1254419/">rejected Darusman's findings</a> [Reuters report] in a statement to the <a href = "http://www.un.org/en/ga/third/index.shtml">UN General Assembly Third Committee</a> [official website].

<p>Earlier this month, North Korea <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/south-korea-attempts-to-halt-distribution-of-anti-north-korea-leaflets.php">threatened military action</a> [JURIST report] against South Korea if South Korean activists carried out their plan to pass leaflets across the border via balloons. North Korea has faced ongoing international criticism for human rights violations. In June, the <a href="http://hrnk.org/">Committee for Human Rights in North Korea</a> (HRNK) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/north-korea-caste-system-leads-to-human-rights-violations-report.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that North Korea's caste system leads to abuses and human rights violations in the country. Darusman previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-expert-criticizes-north-korea-treatment-of-prisoners.php">criticized North Korea's human rights record</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011, focusing on the treatment of prisoners and echoing a UN General Assembly <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/gashc4032.doc.htm">resolution</a> [text] concerning the country's human rights conditions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Further, AI reaffirmed the prisoners' rights to adequate medical care throughout their hunger strike, which they plan on continuing until they receive their property and an apology.

In a report to the UN General Assembly, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran Ahmed Shaheed declared that human rights activists in Iran are being subjected to beatings, mock hangings, sleep deprivation and threats that their family members will be killed or raped. Also in October the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">urged Iran</a> [JURIST report] to halt all executions because the government has failed to provide the accused with fair trials and due process of law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontguantanamosign.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Depatment of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/MOU-Notice-of-Appeal.pdf">notice of appeal</a> [text, PDF] in the <a href = "http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] opposing a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] rejecting the government's argument that they should be allowed to set certain rules regarding <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainees' access to counsel. The administration's filing is to extend time for a decision to officially appeal. A representative of the DOJ spoke to <a href = "http://www.politico.com/">Politico</a> [media website] and stated a <a href = "http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/11/obama-appeals-to-set-rules-for-guantanamo-lawyers-148240.html">final decision has not been made</a> [Politico report]. The government is seeking authority to set visitation and communication rules for the detainees without court approval. They argue that, once a <em>habeas</em> petition is terminated, the 2008 <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_08-mc-00442/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_08-mc-00442-7.pdf">Protective Order</a> [order, PDF] expires and the executive has the prerogative of assuring counsel access. This argument was rejected in a harshly worded <a href = "/paperchase/GuantanamoMOU09062012.pdf">opinion</a> [PDF] by a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] that characterized the attempt as an overreach of executive power.

<p>The notice of appeal is the latest development in the Guantanamo Bay prisoner debate. Earlier in August the DOJ filed a brief with the court asserting that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/doj-argues-continued-attorney-access-at-guantanamo-is-government-decision.php">government should decide</a> [JURIST report] when a Guantanamo prisoner is granted continued regular access to legal counsel absent a detainee's ongoing habeas or other legal challenge. The challenge to the new restrictions was brought by six Guantanamo detainees, two of whose <em>habeas</em> petitions were denied and four dismissed with the possibility of reconsideration. At the time of the hearing lawyers for only six of the 170 detainees at Guantanamo had signed a <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Post-Habeas-MOU.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a> (MOU) [memorandum, PDF]. In the 10 years since the first detainees were brought to Guantanamo Bay, only a handful have been tried or convicted, and in the past few months there have been several calls by the UN and various foreign governments for some long-held Guantanamo detainees to be returned to their home countries, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-requests-release-of-its-last-citizen-held-at-guantanamo.php">Egypt</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-official-calls-for-transfer-of-khadr-to-canada.php">Canada</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/kuwait-lawyer-sues-government-officials-for-release-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">Kuwait</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protesters waved placards and shouted slogans calling on the government to <a href="http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/fullstory.php?nid=1009140144">halt to the impeachment</a> [AFP report]. Last week, a government spokesperson announced that the government had begun the process of impeaching Bandaranayake. The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/11/01/sri-lanka-government-starts-process-to-impeach-chief-justice-amid-conflict-with/">specific charges were not revealed</a> [AP report], but spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella confirmed that the impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake was approved by more than 75 members of parliament. It has been speculated that the impeachment was prompted by Bandaranayake's decision to <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\11\03\story_3-11-2012_pg14_5">strike down a bill</a> [AFP report] giving more powers to the economic development ministry, which is headed by the Sri Lankan president's younger brother. 

<p>Tension continues to grow between the Sri Lankan government and the judiciary after an outspoken judge was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sri-lanka-judges-lawyers-protest-assault-of-outspoken-judge.php">assaulted last month</a> [JURIST report]. Sri Lanka is still struggling to establish rule of law in the wake of a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009. In July the government of Sri Lanka said that it may take up to five years to prosecute people <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">accused of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder]. Earlier in July <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Sri Lanka to stop <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report]. Last November the Sri Lankan government was subjected to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. In April 2011 a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In June 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-commissioner-calls-for-international-inquiry-into-sri-lanka-conflict.php">called for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the conduct of the Sri Lankan government during its civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Business/Pages/WGHRandtransnationalcorporationsandotherbusiness.aspx">Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises</a> is a group of five independent experts established by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official websites] to explore remedies for those affected by international corporate activities, primarily through the three-year implementation of the UN "Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights" framework. In his presentation, Working Group head Puvan Selvanathan urged states and business enterprises to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43412&Cr=business&Cr1=#.UJfZeoUapFU">identify sector-specific human rights issues</a> [UN News Centre report] and to take measures to raise awareness, build capacity and implement the Working Principles within each sector:<blockquote>The Working Group is encouraged by the number of initiatives undertaken to embed the Guiding Principles into global governance frameworks since their adoption, and by dissemination and implementation initiatives led by stakeholders, some of which are outlined below. Notwithstanding, significant challenges and gaps exist towards achieving the effective dissemination and implementation of the Guiding Principles. Addressing these issues requires greater, sustained and scaled-up efforts from all stakeholders for long-lasting change to prevent, reduce and address adverse impacts on human rights linked to business activities.</blockquote>The group referred to at-risk groups such as children and the elderly, indigenous communities, migrant workers, journalists and human rights defenders, community activists, and minorities, among others.

<p>Last week the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief presented a report to the General Assembly urging all member states to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-expert-urges-promotion-of-freedom-of-religious-conversion.php">protect freedom of belief as applied to religious conversion</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that week Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/IDPIndex.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a> [official profile] made her annual presentation to the General Assembly, suggesting a policy of "strengthening the judiciary from within" in which governments develop anti-corruption bodies to ensure that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-expert-judicial-corruption-threatens-rule-of-law.php">judges act impartially and are free from political influence</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month the special rapporteur on human rights in Iran released a report indicating that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">government of Iran is torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] and threatening the activists' families with rape or death. Last month Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/WaterAndSanitation/SRWater/Pages/CatarinaDeAlbuquerque.aspx">Catarina de Albuquerque</a> [official profile] lauded a new California law that <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-expert-welcomes-california-safe-drinking-water-law.php">creates a right to safe drinking water</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

South Sudan reportedly ejected UN officer Sandra Beidas for allegedly <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-04/news/sns-rt-us-sudan-south-unbre8a30fz-20121104_1_south-sudan-barnaba-marial-benjamin-human-rights">writing false reports</a> [Reuters report]. It is possible that the expulsion was due to the release of an August report accusing the army of killing and abusing civilians. Secretary-General Special Representative for South Sudan <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sga1299.doc.htm">Hilde Johnson</a> [UN backgrounder] <a href="http://unmiss.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=UqAP9lGSgVc%3d&tabid=4041&mid=6878&language=en-US">criticized the decision</a> [statement, PDF] as a violation of the government's legal obligations to the UN and its mission in the country:<blockquote>The order is in breach of the legal obligations of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan under the Charter of the United Nations. I have therefore been in discussions with the highest levels of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan to seek clarification on the reasons behind the order and to protest against this decision ... Human rights monitoring, investigation and reporting, and building capacity, is a core element of the mandate of UNMISS which must be protected ... The United Nations is committed to continue assisting South Sudan in fulfilling this important promise to its people.</blockquote>The UNMISS wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 25 and Johnson has met with President Salva Kiir to address the matter, but the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43413&Cr=South+Sudan&Cr1=#.UJflWIUapFU">expulsion order has not yet been withdrawn</a> [UN News Centre report]. In the meantime the expelled officer has been redeployed to the UN Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, Uganda, pending a decision on her future status in South Sudan.

<p>South Sudan is still facing human rights violations and need for improving the situation with Sudan. In late June UNMISS <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/south-sudan-urged-to-adopt-plan-to-prevent-future-violence.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government to adopt a plan to <a href="http://unmiss.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=BnqdT-sQAJY%3D&tabid=3465&language=en-US">prevent further inter-communal violence</a> [press release] in Jonglei State. UNMISS provided nine recommendations for the country to avoid similar violence and conflicts in the future, including the development a "comprehensive, multi-sectorial plan with short, medium and long-term actions to respond to the main causes of the violence in Jonglei State" while maintaining support for the peace process that has already launched. In February Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-south-sudan-to-prosecute-those-responsible-for-ethnic-violence.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] South Sudan to investigate the ethnic conflict sparked by the attacks made on Murle villages and to prosecute those responsible for the violence. In December around 6,000 to 8,000 armed Lou Nuer youths calling themselves "White Army" invaded the Murle villages for 12 days, robbing and burning houses and killing thousands of people. In response the Murle groups initiated retaliatory attacks on Lou Nuer and Bor Dinka areas which lasted until February 4. In April the Sudanese government <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/sudan-declares-state-of-emergency-on-south-sudan-border.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] on the South Sudan border after the arrest of four people who the Sudanese claim were arrested for aggression against the north in the contested Heglig oil fields.</p>]]></content:encoded>

FIDH criticized the AHRD for stating that human rights freedoms must be considered based on different regional contexts and "bearing in mind different political, economic, legal, social, cultural, historical and religious backgrounds." FIDH further criticized the AHRD for limiting the grant of human rights freedoms based on "national security" and "public morality." FIDH argued that to limit the grant of human rights protections in this way goes against the entire point of these types of protections and that ASEAN has a duty under international law to guarantee broad grants of human rights freedoms. Other commentators have criticized the AHRD for <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/asia/2012/09/28/does-the-asean-human-rights-declaration-even-matter/">lacking an effective enforcement mechanism</a> [CFR report], not being clear in the drafting process, limiting the participation of outside groups in the drafting process and failing to mention groups that need protection. FIDH called on ASEAN to redraft the AHRD in a "transparent, deliberate and inclusive process" and comply with conventional international human rights protections.

<p>Although ASEAN agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/asean-agrees-to-extend-human-rights-protections.php">extend human right protections</a> [JURIST report] in April, several southeast Asian nations have been subject to close scrutiny on human rights recently. In August a report released by <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> (PHR) [advocacy website] found that Myanmar's army is <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state. Earlier that month a report released by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-myanmar-forces-committed-human-rights-violations-following-mob-violence.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Myanmar security forces committed killings, rape and mass arrests following an outbreak of sectarian violence in western Rakhine State. In July two UN Special Rapporteurs <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/philippines-urged-to-protect-human-rights-defenders.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Philippines to protect human rights defenders and ensure that they can pursue their work without interference. In April HRW urged the Philippines military to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/philippines-military-urged-to-act-on-human-rights-abuses.php">act on human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] and hold violators accountable. Also in April <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-sg-urges-cambodia-to-cooperate-with-new-genocide-tribunal-judges.php">urged the government of Cambodia</a> [JURIST report] to give its full cooperation to the judges that will be appointed to investigate the genocide during <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge regime</a> [BBC backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement appears to be a response to the recent decision by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pakistan-high-court-recommends-probe-of-1990-election-bribery-scandal.php">launch legal proceedings</a> [JURIST report] against a former army chief and intelligence director for their involvement in the country's 1990 election bribery scandal. Kayani's statement has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/pakistan-army-chief-warns-against-efforts-to-undermine-military-in-rare-public-statement/2012/11/05/af67652e-275e-11e2-ac64-5d52a2c5953e_story.html">generated concern</a> [AP report] because of the country's history of military coups and the fact that the Pakistan military is the largest and most powerful establishment in the country. However, experts suggest that the statement is merely an attempt to push back on the judiciary as the military has slowly ceded power recently. Kayani stressed the future and the role of the constitution:<blockquote>An intense discussion and debate is natural in this process. No individual or institution has the monopoly to decide what is right or wrong in defining the ultimate national interest. It should emerge only through a consensus, and all Pakistanis have a right to express their opinions. The constitution provides a clear mechanism for it. We all have a great responsibility to shoulder. We should learn from our past, try to build the present and keep our eyes set on a better future. We all agree that strengthening the institutions, ensuring the rule of law and working within the well defined bounds of the constitution is the right way forward. Weakening of the institutions and trying to assume more than one's due role will set us back. We owe it to the future of Pakistan, to lay correct foundations, today. We should not be carried away by short term considerations which may have greater negative consequences in the future.</blockquote>The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court did not back down from his position in a speech he gave in response to Kayani's comments and agreed that the country should proceed under the constitution, but reiterated that the constitution gives the judiciary supreme authority over other government institutions.

<p>This decision to bring charges against the former military chief comes in the wake of years of hearings dating back to the 1996 petition filed by Khan, a former Air Marshal. The petition <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/29/world/asia/pakistan-intel-election/index.html">resurfaced in the Supreme Court in February</a> [CNN report]. The 1990 election was a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7014433.stm">victory for the right-wing political party</a> [BBC timeline], the Islamic Democratic Alliance (IDA). It resulted in the defeat of a number of different PPP officials, including the highly-revered former Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2228796.stm">Benazir Bhutto</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Benazir+Bhutto">news archive</a>]. Bhutto was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/pakistan-ex-pm-bhutto-assassinated-at.php">assassinated</a> [JURIST report] in a suicide attack in 2007 at a rally in Rawalpindi while campaigning for her party in the lead-up to the 2008 parliamentary elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, the groups recommended that the country abandon the punishment "in law or practice by placing a moratorium on all executions" in December, the first opportunity for South Sudan to vote on a UN General Assembly resolution to establishing such a moratorium. In a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR65/006/2012/en/27fde438-5fdd-4257-bcc9-105f76e423dd/afr650062012en.pdf">letter</a> [letter, PDF] sent to South Sudan <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/+-Nhial-Deng-Nhial,833-+">Minister of Foreign Affairs Nhial Deng Nhial</a> [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> backgrounder], the rights groups expressed not only their concern that capital punishment "runs counter to the global move and commitment" to end such penalties, but also that the country's executions do not meet the minimum standards and safeguards provided by international law. While South Sudan has continued to use the death penalty, more than two-thirds of UN members states have abolished it in law or practice.

<p>The issue of the death penalty continues to be heavily debated on both national and international levels. Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-iran-must-halt-capital-punishment.php">urged Iran</a> [JURIST report] to immediately stop all executions, including 11 planned for the following day. The UN has repeatedly called on Iran to abandon the death penalty, but instead the country has increased the number of people it is executing. In August a UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-rights-expert-denounces-executions-in-iraq.php">condemned Iraq</a> [JURIST report] for the executions of 21 people and an additional five only two days later. Also in August UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-rights-chief-urges-gambia-to-halt-executions.php">urged the Gambia</a> [JURIST report] to enact a moratorium on the death penalty. In July <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/singapore-plans-to-relax-mandatory-death-sentences-in-certain-cases.php">Singapore announced</a> [JURIST report] it planned to relax mandatory death sentences in certain cases [JURIST report]. Only a week earlier UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-capital-punishment.php">end to capital punishment</a> [JURIST report]. In April, an initiative in California dealing with <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/california-to-put-death-penalty-repeal-on-november-ballot.php">overhauling death penalty laws in the state</a> [JURIST report] made it on to the ballot for a November vote.                                                </p>]]></content:encoded>

Sgt. Robert Bales was originally charged with <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/us-soldier-charged-with-17-counts-of-murder-in-afghan-civilian-shootings.php">17 counts of murder</a>, including women and children, in a Kandahar village, but <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-army-amends-charges-in-afghan-shootings-case.php">one charge was dropped</a> [JURIST reports] in June. Bales also stands accused of six counts of attempted murder, seven counts of assault, and illicit use of alcohol and steroids. Some speculate that Bales, who served three tours in Iraq prior to his tour in Afghanistan, may use symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder as a defense to the killings. The hearing to determine whether there is enough evidence for a trial is proceeding according to <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/ucmj/blart-32.htm">Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> [text].

<p>Bales allegedly went on a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/possible-death-penalty-for-us-soldier-accused-in-afghanistan-civilian-shootings.php">shooting rampage</a> [JURIST report] in a Kandahar village in March and immediately turned himself in at his base. He is not the first US soldier prosecuted in relation to deaths of civilians in Afghanistan. In February, the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-drops-charges-in-afghan-civilian-death-case.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against Army Specialist Michael Wagnon, the last of five soldiers to be charged in connection with the killing of three Afghan civilians. In November, US Sgt. Calvin Gibbs was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-army-soldier-convicted-of-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">convicted on 15 charges</a> [JURIST report] of murder, assault, and conspiracy in the same case. Before Gibbs was convicted, in March of last year, Army Specialist Jeremy Morlock <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-solider-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghan-civilians.php">admitted to three counts of murder</a> [JURIST report] as part of a plot with other soldiers to kill Afghan civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-864.pdf">Comcast v. Behrend</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-takes-10-more-cases-for-2012-term.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on how much judicial discretion is allowed when certifying a class for a class action lawsuit. In this case, the district court certified a class by judicial discretion, without resolving whether the plaintiff class had introduced admissible expert evidence, and the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed. The attorney for Comcast argued that although "abstract methodology, such as econometrics or regression analysis" might be used in the damages phase of a trial, it is too vague to use when certifying a class. The respondents argued that Comcast completely ignored the <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=827109112258472814&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Daubert standard</a> [opinion] for admissibility of expert evidence because it was inconvenient to its case. "The district judge has an obligation to serve as a gatekeeper whether there is a jury in the box or not. On a preliminary injunction, the court, if there is a proper <span class = "casename">Daubert</span> objection, must make the objection at that time."

<p>The Court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1085.pdf">Amgen Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-double-jeopardy-clause.php">report</a>] about whether, in a misrepresentation case under <a href="http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34ActRls/rule10b-5.html">Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5</a> [text], the district court must require proof of materiality before certifying a plaintiff class based on the fraud-on-the-market theory and whether a defendant should be given the opportunity to rebut such presumption at the class certification stage. An attorney for Amgen Inc., a pharmaceutical company, argued that a false statement or misrepresentation is not an acceptable substitute for materiality.<blockquote>[E]very one of the four predicates to the fraud-on-the-market theory, which is a shortcut that&#8212;that excuses plaintiffs from proving that I heard the statement and relied on it&#8212;every one of those predicates is common. Whether the market is efficient is common. Whether the statement is public is common. Whether the stocks were bought and sold during the period of market distortion is common. And materiality is common. ... The falsity of the statement is common, but it is not a predicate to whether or not you can prove reliance on a statement indirectly by relying on the integrity of the market price, because in an efficient market, material public statements, whether they are true or false, will presumably move the market price.</blockquote>Respondents argued that, "Because materiality always generates a common answer for all class members, it is the quintessential common issue that does not splinter the class or cause it to be noncohesive for purposes of understanding predominance."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Horne</a> [case materials] to consider a new Arizona <a href="http://azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=2036&Session_Id=107&image.x=0&image.y=0">abortion regulation</a> [HB 2036 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/arizona-governor-signs-bill-to-ban-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">report</a>] that would ban abortions after 20 weeks unless there is a medical emergency. A group of doctors, represented by attorney Janet Crepps from the <a href = "http://reproductiverights.org/">The Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website] opened the session by arguing that <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-744.ZS.html">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> and <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZS.html">Gonzales v. Carhart</a> [opinions] hold that "regardless of whether exceptions are made the State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy prior to viability. [The Supreme Court] described this rule as the central tenet of the abortion jurisprudence." Crepps also suggested, "There is no debate in the record: at 20 weeks, no fetus is viable. It's a government's intrusion into a woman's autonomy, and that is not acceptable." Defending the law, Maricopa County Attorney <a href = "http://www.maricopacountyattorney.org/">Bill Montgomery</a> [official website] argued that the increasing risk of hemmorage to the woman after 20 weeks, and the Arizona legislature's findings of "fetal pain" allow the regulation. Montgomery also argued that the law does not ban abortions after 20 weeks, it merely regulates them. The law provides for abortions in the case of "medical emergency" but also has stipulations imposing misdeamanors against doctors who perform abortions after 20 weeks if that condition is not met. Oral arguments would indicate that the judges were unmoved by Montgomery's arguments, as they repeatedly suggested to him that the regulation does not meet the standards of <span class = "casename">Casey</span> or <span class = "casename">Gonzales</span>. Judge Kleinfeld, particularly, argued to both parties during arguments that a future child's pain is a health interest that the regulation should cover, allowing abortions past 20 weeks: "[S]ometimes you can't discover a birth defect until 20 weeks, and sometimes the fetus will be born with a horrible birth defect, which means it's born into hell, gets several months&#8212;or years&#8212;of operations and pain and then dies, as a baby." The Ninth Circuit <a href = "/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-enjoins-arizona-abortion-law.php">enjoined</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of the law in August. 

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/feature/2012/04/reproductive-rights.php">reproductive rights controversy</a> [JURIST backgrounder], and Arizona has had two abortion regulations tested in the courts. Late last month the US District Court for the District of Arizona <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">enjoined Arizona</a> [JURIST report] from implementing a <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/2r/bills/hb2800p.pdf">public funding law</a> [HB 2800, PDF] that prohibits funding for health clinics that perform abortions. A <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">Texas</a> court upheld a similar law, while the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit enjoined an <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-blocks-indiana-planned-parrenthood-defunding-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] law last month. In addition to Arizona, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2012/05/georgia-governor-signs-bills-barring-late-term-abortions-assisted-suicide.php">Georgia</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks-of-pregnancy.php">Idaho</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/idaho-kansas-lawmakers-approve-bans-on-late-term-abortions.php">Kansas</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">Nebraska</a> and <A href = "/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports] have banned abortions in some form after 20-weeks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Hungary's Law No LXVII of 1997 on the legal status and remuneration of judge was amended in 2011 to require all judges, prosecutors and notaries to retire at the age of 62 instead of 70 as was previously stipulated in the law. Hungary said the change in the retirement age was intended to redress positive discrimination in favor of those persons affected because, in contrast to other public sector employees, they could not only continue to work until the age of 70 but could also, in several cases, combine their salary with the retirement pension to which they were entitled from the time at which they reached retirement age. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website], however, argued that the Hungarian legislation at issue violated Article 2 of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0078:en:HTML">Directive 2000/78/EC</a> [text] in that it gave rise to age-based discrimination between, on the one hand, judges, prosecutors and notaries who have reached the age-limit for retirement fixed by that legislation and, on the other hand, those persons who may continue to work. The ECJ said: <blockquote>The disputed national measures, pursuant to which the fact that a worker has reached the retirement age laid down by that legislation leads to automatic termination of his employment contract, must be regarded as directly imposing less favorable treatment of workers who have reached that age as compared with all other persons in the labor force. Such legislation therefore establishes a difference in treatment directly based on age.</blockquote>The ECJ went on to say that because the amended law on the retirement age of judges, prosecutors and notaries was not proportionate to the objectives Hungary was pursing Hungary failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 2 and 6(1) of Directive 2000/78.

<p>In 2007, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/eu-court-upholds-mandatory-retirement.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] mandatory retirement ages in the EU, saying that mandatory retirement policies do not violate the prohibition against age discrimination if the policy is intended to further the legitimate public interest of increasing employment and the retirees are provided with full pensions. The EU prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation. Directive 2000/78/EC is intended to implement the principle of equal treatment and eliminate inequalities within the EU, but does not prohibit national governments from instituting retirement ages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Special Rapporteur on Racism, Mutuma Ruteere told the General Assembly that an increase of hate websites inciting racial violence necessitates action. Ruteere called on governments, international bodies, private and public sector, and local communities to cooperate in developing a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43418&Cr=racism&Cr1=#.UJkh1himD8B">comprehensive approach to combating Internet hate speech</a> [UN News Centre report]. Ruteere stressed that the comprehensive approach needed to incorporate a firm legal framework that does not infringe on free speech. Ruteree stated that:<blockquote>Any restrictions, control and censorship of the content disseminated via the Internet should be done on a clearly defined legal basis and in a manner that is necessary, proportionate and compatible with States' international human rights obligations including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</blockquote>Ruteere urged states to educate their citizens about the problem with Internet hate speech and to promote tolerance.

<p>Internet restrictions have been subject to international controversy. Last week a controversial Russian Internet regulation law which gives the Russian government the ability to completely block access to certain websites went into <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-internet-regulation-law-takes-effect.php">effect</a> [JURIST report]. The bill's stated purpose is to block access to child pornography and the encouragement of drug use or suicide. In July the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] passed its first-ever <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/human-rights-council-passes-resolution-to-protect-internet-speech.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] to protect the free speech of individuals online. The resolution was approved by all 47 members of the council, including China and Cuba, who have been criticized for limiting Internet freedom. The resolution was written to guarantee Internet freedom, including the free flow of information and freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-05/business/sns-rt-us-google-patentbre8a419m-20121105_1_google-s-motorola-mobility-standard-essential-patents-smartphone-patent-wars">decision was issued</a> [Reuters] just hours before the trial was scheduled to start. Judge Barbara Crabb of the <a href="www.wiwd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5glbvgMw9e0_4kr11fmVUzR7wPoVw?docId=a4c25702d2084e93a26ff4c517c4db2d">did not give a reason</a> [AP report] for the lawsuit's dismissal. At stake were the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/technology/apple-patent-suit-is-dismissed.html">library of patents</a> [NYT report] that Google acquired along with Motorola for $12.5 billion in May of this year. Apple alleged that Motorola Mobility sought to institute unreasonably high license fees for the use of wireless technology patents.

<p>In October the Mannheim Regional Court in Germany <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/germany-court-rules-for-motorola-in-microsoft-patent-dispute.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Motorola Mobility in a lawsuit against Microsoft. The patent at issue, <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&date=20060823&DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&locale=en_EP&CC=EP&NR=1233343B1&KC=B1&ND=4">EP1233343</a> [text], is for technology that allows applications to work with different mobile communication hardware and cellular networks. This allows the same application to work with different mobile phones. The court found that Motorola did not infringe Microsoft's patent. Motorola has been very active in German courts both seeking to protect and asserting its intellectual property. In September <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] won an injunction against Motorlola for infringing <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/apple-wins-injunction-against-motorola-in-germany-court.php">EP2126788</a> [JURIST report] which covered "rubber-banding" technology in scrolling lists. In July a German court granted an injunction for Microsoft  against Motorola in a patent infringement case over <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-court-issues-injunction-against-motorola.php">EP0618540</a> [JURIST report] which involved technology relating to common names for long and short file allocation tables. Also in July a German court dismissed a patent infringement suit by Microsoft over <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-court-rejects-microsofts-case-against-motorola.php">EP1304891</a> [JURIST report] which monitors different functions on a smartphone and provides such information to other applications utilizing them. Another case that was brought by Microsoft against Motorola Mobility involving a patent on system input methods is postponed to September 20. In February Apple sued Motorola in the <a href="http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of California</a> [official website] seeking an <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/apple-sues-motorola-in-federal-court-over-patent-claims-in-germany.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] to stop Motorola from bringing patent claims against Apple in Germany, alleging that the German suit violates a licensing agreement between Motorola and Qualcomm.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This arrest came three days after the BCHR had <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/node/5495">released a report</a> [text] holding the king of Bahrain responsible for the spread of the culture of impunity within the country. Al-Muhafda's arrest also came only one month after his involvement at the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website].

The Turkish judge began the proceedings with <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/06/us-turkey-israel-trial-idUSBRE8A50Z420121106">testimony</a> [Reuters report] from people who were on board the flotilla, as well as from relatives of the deceased. Prosecutors have demanded <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/turkish-court-tries-israelis-gaza-flotilla-case-094017427.html">life in prison</a> [AP report] for the Israeli commanders involved in the May 2010 raid to enforce a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. The case illustrates tension between Turkey and Israel, which have previously maintained close diplomatic ties. Israel has criticized the trial of the four Israeli commanders, dismissing the proceedings as politically motivated. Hundreds of protestors showed up outside the courthouse to voice their opposition to the actions of these  commanders. Turkey has demanded an end to the Gaza blockade, a formal apology and compensation for the victims and their family.

<p>The Gaza blockade has been highly criticized by the international community. In July 50 aid groups and UN offices signed a joint statement <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-aid-groups-urge-israel-to-end-gaza-blockade.php">urging Israel to end its blockade</a> [JURIST report] of the Gaza Strip, calling it a violation of international law. Among the signatories were Amnesty International, the World Health Organization and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The joint statement followed a call by the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-official-israel-must-lift-blockade-of-gaza-strip.php">end the blockade</a> [JURIST report], which she argued deprives Gaza residents of basic humanitarian needs. Human Rights Watch in February <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-israel-to-end-residency-restrictions.php">urged Israel</a> [JURIST report] to change its policies that forbid Palestinians from traveling through and living in Gaza and the West Bank. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 94-14 vote in which 129 members were present, the bill was heavily criticized during the two-day debate for its possible detrimental effect on the country's current legal system. The proposal would have given same-sex couples some of the rights that heterosexual married couples already enjoy such as parental rights over children or inheritance rights after the death of a partner. Supporters of the bill <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFBRE8A50VF20121106">argued</a> [Reuters report] that it would give loving and responsible homosexual couples the legitimacy they deserve. In response, opposing parties condemned the bill of destroying traditional family values in a country in which the majority is Catholic. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] recognition has been a contentious issue both internationally as well as within the US. Thus far in 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/france-prime-minister-to-propose-same-sex-marriage-bill-in-october.php">France</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-proposes-several-marriage-rights-to-same-sex-unions.php">Germany</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/scotland-announces-plans-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage.php">Scotland</a> [JURIST reports] have all seen new efforts to get same-sex marriages recognized. In September an attempt by Australian legislators to legalize same-sex marriage was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/australia-lawmakers-reject-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">overwhelmingly voted down</a> [JURIST report]. During the same month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] asked the US Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/doj-asks-supreme-court-to-consider-two-additional-challenges-to-doma.php">consider two more challenges</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:/">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text], which prohibits federal recognition of same-sex marriages. In July a lesbian couple filed a lawsuit in the US <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] in a DOMA challenge that seeks to achieve for gay and lesbian couples the <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lesbian-couple-seeking-immigration-rights-sue-to-overturn-doma.php">same federal immigration rights afforded to heterosexual couples</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://batkivschina.com/index.php">Batkivshchyna</a>, the country's far-right nationalist party <a href="http://www.svoboda.org.ua/">Svoboda</a> and <a href="http://klichko.org/">Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform Vitaliy Klychko</a> [party websites, in Ukrainian] have organized protests outside the Central Election Commission's office to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/06/ukraine-election-idUSL5E8M68EK20121106">argue</a> [Reuters report] that the October parliamentary elections were won by fraud and pre-election bias in local media. The country's <a href="http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/">Prime Minister Mykola Azarov</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] responded by accusing the opposition of trying to repeat the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4061253.stm">Orange revolution</a> [BBC timeline]. The parliament also blocked the opposition's demand by ordering only a partial recount of five districts. Opposition leaders stated that they will keep pushing their demands. The country's authorities have until November 12 to announce preliminary results and until November 17 for binding official results pursuant to Ukraine's election law. 

<p>Ukraine's October election drew the focus of the international community in light of the ongoing trial prosecution of country's former prime minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tymoshenko">news archive</a>]. In September, the head of the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/europe-human-rights-overseer-urges-open-and-honest-elections-in-ukraine.php">advocated for free and fair parliamentary elections</a> [JURIST report] in Ukraine as he condemned the imprisonment of Tymoshenko. In August the Ukrainian <a href="http://www.scourt.gov.ua/">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-high-court-denies-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-appeal.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Tymoshenko's abuse of office conviction, reasoning that there would be no basis to rule in favor of the former prime minister and that the prison sentence is appropriate considering the charges against her. During the appeal the government denied allegations that the criminal proceedings against Tymoshenko were a measure initiated by Yanukovich to prevent her from participating in the October elections. The decision came only a day after the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/europe-rights-court-hears-tymoshenko-appeal.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] on Tymoshenko's appeal. During the same month, Ukrainian prosecutors urged the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-prosecutors-urge-court-not-to-hear-tymoshenko-appeal.php">not to hear her appeal</a> [JURIST report]. Prosecutors told the court that Tymoshenko's trial had already established her guilt in the case, and asked the judges to let stand a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">seven-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST report] in the case. Tymoshenko was not present at the hearing due to health concerns. The hearing <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/ukraine-court-postpones-tymoshenko-appeal-for-third-time.php">has been delayed</a> [JURIST report] in the past due to Tymoshenko's absence. Yanukovich was narrowly <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ukraine-pm-drops-lawsuit-challenging.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] over Tymoshenko in 2010. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-8976.pdf">Smith v. United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-conspiracy-case.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on the burden of proof in conspiracy cases. At issue is a jury instruction that allowed jurors to assume that the defendants did not abandon the conspiracy unless the defendants positively demonstrated that this was the case. The jurors convicted the defendants based on the fact that they had been members of the group during a time that was barred by statute of limitations. The attorney for the defendants, Calvin Smith and John Raynor, argued to the court that the doctrine of withdrawal from a conspiracy should control over the issue. "It's the statute of limitations that is the defense in the case. It's the doctrine of withdrawal that triggers&#8212;that is the triggering event for the statute of limitations, which sets the date for when the statute of limitations starts to run. Withdrawal in and of itself is not a defense. It's the statute of limitations that's the defense." The Solicitor General argued that the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] "does not require the government to disprove withdrawal outside the limitations period, because lack of withdrawal is not an element of the crime of conspiracy."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1327.pdf">Evans v. Michigan</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-to-hear-case-on-double-jeopardy-clause.php">report</a>] on whether <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/double_jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] attaches after a trial judge erroneously holds a particular fact to be an element of the offense and then grants a midtrial directed verdict of acquittal because the prosecution failed to prove that fact. An attorney for Lamar Evans argued that precedent dictates a judge's determination of not guilty is a final determination of an acquittal where double jeopardy is concerned, even if the judge commits errors of law or fact. The state of Michigan argued that, historically, this was the type of situation the double jeopardy clause was designed to prevent:<blockquote>The Jeopardy Clause is aimed at prohibiting certain governmental abuses that occurred historically. 12 One of them is when the government would terminate a trial that was not going well, without the consent of the defendant, in order to take another shot at it, to build a better case or perhaps get a better factfinder; and the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits that kind of conduct by establishing through this Court's cases that mistrials without the consent of the defendant bar retrial; that abhorrent practice is barred unless a manifest necessity is shown. ... But if there is consent, as there was in this case&#8212;the defendant asked the judge to terminate the trial without going to this jury, so he gave up his valued right to a decision by this tribunal&#8212;if he does that, then that&#8212;the other side of that coin is, that is ordinarily outcome-determinative the other way. A retrial is permissible unless the government has achieved the first harm by the back door, that is by goading the defendant into the mistrial.</blockquote>The Solicitor General also argued in support of the state of Michigan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum was championed by <a href="http://equalitymaine.org/">EqualityMaine</a> [advocacy website], who <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maine-to-put-same-sex-marriage-referendum-on-november-ballot.php">gathered enough signatures</a> [JURIST report] earlier this year to include the question on the November ballot. The Maine legislature passed a same-sex marriage bill in 2009, but <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-veto-same-sex-marriage.php">voters chose to overturn the measure</a> [JURIST report] by voting in a referendum.

<p>Maryland electorates also voted to legalize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] by a slim margin on Tuesday. Question 6, which asked voters whether they wanted to uphold the <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/2012rs/chapters_noln/Ch_2_hb0438T.pdf">Civil Marriage Protection Act</a> [HB 438, PDF], was answered in the affirmative by 50 percent of Maryland voters. Maryland <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/maryland-becomes-eighth-state-to-allow-same-sex-marriage.php">joined the seven states that allow same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] in March when <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us/">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> [official website] signed the Civil Marriage Protection Act. The Maryland <a href="http://www.elections.state.md.us/">Board of Elections</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.elections.state.md.us/petitions/Certification_Notice_civil_marriage.pdf">officially certified</a> [certification notice, PDF] a referendum petition in July seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/maryland-board-of-elections-approves-same-sex-marriage-repeal.php">challenge the state's same-sex marriage law</a> [JURIST report] in Tuesday's election. The law will take effect on January 1, 2013.</p>

<p>Washingtonians have unofficially approved the state's <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/r074.pdf">same-sex marriage law</a> [SB 6239 text] in Tuesday's election with nearly 52 percent of the tallied votes favoring the law. <a href="http://preservemarriagewashington.com/threat.php">Preserve Marriage Washington</a> [advocacy website] presented over 200,000 referendum signatures seeking to overturn the state's same-sex marriage legislation, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law by Washington Governor Chris Gregoire in February.

<p>Finally, Minnesota voters struck down a ballot initiative that would have outlawed same-sex marriages in the state. 51 percent of voters opposed <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bin/bldbill.php?bill=S1308.1.html&session=ls87">Amendment 1</a> [text], an amendment to the state's Constitution banning same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum was presented in a two-question format. Nearly 54 percent of Puerto Rican voters wanted to <a href="http://news.msn.com/politics/puerto-ricans-opt-for-statehood-in-referendum">change the island territory's relationship</a> [AP report] with the US, and a resounding 61 percent of voters selected the statehood option. Voters were given the opportunity to choose from three political status options, the other two being independence or sovereign free association. The referendum requires final approval from Congress.

<p>Puerto Rican <a href="http://www.fortaleza.gobierno.pr/">Governor Luis Fortuno</a> [official website, in Spanish], a supporter of statehood, <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/puerto-rico-governor-approves-political-status-referendum.php">signed legislation establishing the two-part referendum</a> [JURIST report] last December that would allow Puerto Ricans to voice their opinions regarding Puerto Rico's political status and connection to the US. The Puerto Rican House of Representatives voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/puerto-rico-to-hold-status-referendum.php">pass the legislation</a> [JURIST report] to permit the referendum that same month. The US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/done-us-house-passes-bill-on-puerto-rico-status-referendum.php">approved a bill to establish the referendum</a> [JURIST report] in April 2010, but it was never approved by the Senate. In 2007, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dpi/decolonization/special_committee_main.htm">Special Committee on Decolonization</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/gacol3160.doc.htm">called on the US</a> [press release] to resolve the island's political status and release political prisoners. Puerto Ricans last voted on the status of the island in <a href="http://electionspuertorico.org/1998/summary.html">1998</a> [results], with the "None of the Above" option winning 50.3 percent, statehood garnering 46.5 percent of the vote and independence only 2.5 percent. The island was established as a US commonwealth in 1952 after Congress adopted the Puerto Rican Constitution. Puerto Ricans have been US citizens since 1917, and the island has been under US control since 1898. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://pierluisi.house.gov/">Pedro Pierluisi</a>, Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, representing the territory in the US House of Representatives, contends that the <a href="/hotline/2012/02/pedro-pierluisi-referendum.php">Puerto Rico status referendum is historic</a> [JURIST comment] because it is the first to include only the viable status options and will be taken seriously by the federal government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Supporters of the proposal say that these affirmative action programs are no longer necessary to assure equal opportunity, while those opposed, such as the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Okla-voters-to-decide-affirmative-action-future-3967223.php">question the political motive</a> [AP report] behind the decision to put this initiative on the ballot.

<p>Affirmative action proposals similar to Oklahoma's have already passed in other states. Arizona voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-amendment-banning-affirmative-action.php"> approved an affirmative action ban</a> [JURIST report] in 2010. California also approved an affirmative action ban in 1996, which was most recently <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-california-affirmative-action-ban.php">upheld by the Ninth Circuit</a> [JURIST report] in April. The US Supreme Court in October <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case of <span class="casename">Fisher v. University of Texas</span> at Austin, where the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the school's affirmative action program. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the university's program and the US Supreme Court will <a href="/dateline/2012/05/james-craig-affirmative-action.php">ultimately determine</a> [JURIST op-ed] whether the program violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process Clause</a> of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill extends the rights of marriage, including adoption rights, to same-sex couples living in France without altering current legal marriage and adoptive relationships. The bill was pushed forward by <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Francois Hollande</a> [official website, in French] despite becoming a controversial issue. During his campaign, the president's support for same-sex marriage received wide backing, but his efforts have met opposition from religious leaders and the conservative opposition. In October <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/index.htm">Pope Benedict XVI</a> [official profile] urged French priests to oppose the bill. On Sunday in Lourdes, <a href="http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios2007.htm#Vingt">Archbishop Andre Vingt-Trois</a> [profile] preached in  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9659058/French-gay-marriage-plans-a-sham-that-will-smash-foundations-of-society.html">favor of traditional marriage</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report], claiming heterosexual parents are necessary for a child's development. As a result, support for the bill in the largely Catholic country has wavered. The bill will be sent to the legislature for final approval early next year. Last year the French National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-lawmakers-reject-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">rejected a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would have legalized same-sex marriage. France's <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/">Constitutional Council</a> [official website, in French] also dealt a blow to same-sex marriage supporters last year, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/france-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that a ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the constitution. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] rights remain controversial around the world. On Tuesday voters in Maine and Maryland <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] bills legalizing same-sex marriage within those states. Maine and Maryland join six states, as well as the District of Columbia, in extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. Also Tuesday Spain's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/spain-constitutional-court-rejects-same-sex-marriage-challenge.php">denied</a> an appeal challenging the constitutionality of Spain's same-sex marriage law, and the Slovakian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/slovakia-parliament-rejects-same-sex-partnership-bill.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] a proposal recognizing same-sex marriage rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-judiciary-in-detail/jurisdictions/military-jurisdiction">Judge Advocate General</a> for the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/judge-advocate-general">Military Court Centre in Bulford</a> [official websites] <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/order-anonymity-marines-a-e-07112012.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] Wednesday that five UK Royal Marines charged with murder are to remain anonymous throughout their court martial. The five are charged with killing a wounded Taliban fighter, who appeared in a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9607343/Five-Royal-Marines-charged-with-murder-following-video-footage-discovery.html">video</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] that features marines debating whether to give the fighter medical care. Judge Blackett issued an interim anonymity order in late October that came under review at a hearing on Tuesday where the court determined whether the public release of the defendants' identities would put them at risk. Blackett ruled that the anonymity order will remain in place throughout the proceedings to protect the defendants from harm:<blockquote>I am satisfied that, within the context of this case (including the unpredictability of terrorist attacks and the ongoing operations in Afghanistan) there would be a real and immeadiate risk to the lives of the Defendants were they to be identified by name. That risk is from Jihadist cells or extremists motivated to act alone either now or in the future and will increase significantly as the case progresses.</blockquote>The court will determine whether to keep the anonymity protection in place at the conclusion of the court martial.

These charges are the latest in a series of incidents arising out of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In February the <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-drops-charges-in-afghan-civilian-death-case.php">dropped all charges</a> [JURIST report] against an army specialist charged with killing Afghan civilians. Last November a US military court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-army-soldier-convicted-of-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] an army sergeant of three counts of premeditated murder.

Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, urged Obama to "make good the promise he made four years ago to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay." He also encouraged Obama to put an end to practices such as warrantless surveillance, drone strikes and indefinite detention:<blockquote>We congratulate President Obama on his re-election. This is his opportunity to reaffirm our constitutional principles and the fundamental American values of due process, respect for the rule of law and individual freedom. It is a time to once again be a nation where we can be both safe and free.</blockquote>Obama won reelection Tuesday over Republican challenger Mitt Romney and will serve until 2016.

<p>During his 2008 campaign, Obama stated that closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison would be a priority for his first term. Shortly after he assumed office, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] for the closure of the site within one year. According to Forum contributor David Frakt, the Obama administration is <a href="/forum/2012/09/david-frakt-guantanamo-detainees.php">not solely to blame</a> [JURIST op-ed] for Guantanamo Bay remaining open. The US Congress has, since 2009, "passed a series of increasingly stringent spending restrictions which have made it virtually impossible to transfer most detainees out of Guantanamo." Other scholars, including Forum contributor Jonathan Hafetz, have <a href="/forum/2011/04/failing-to-close-guantanamo.php">raised concerns</a> [JURIST op-ed] about how the failure to close Guantanamo Bay "has helped justify the policies of arbitrary detention and torture that spurred its creation in the first place."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[JURIST] Marijuana will become legal in <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] and <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">Washington</a> [Initiative 502, PDF] after voters passed ballot initiatives Tuesday to legalize marijuana for the first time on a statewide basis. In Washington voters approved an Initiative to the Legislature to allow the possession and distribution of marijuana through a state-licensing system of marijuana growers, processors and stores, where <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=8876577">adults can buy up to an ounce</a> [AP report]. The Colorado initiative actually introduces an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and to privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In nearby Oregon the <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">Cannabis Tax Act Initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] failed by <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [<em>Examiner.com</em> report] of the vote. Proponents of legalization claim that states could realize hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from marijuana sales, which will begin when state officials create specific regulations for the new market. Opponents note that marijuana is still illegal on a federal level and predict problematic clashes with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/index.shtml">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> [official websites]. <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medical+marijuana">Medical marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] has been <a href="http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/CDPHE-CHEIS/CBON/1251593017076">legal in Colorado</a> [materials] since voters legitimized it through a constitutional amendment in November 2000, but advocates desired to expand marijuana legality to recreational use as well.

Medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts for the first time Tuesday as over 60 percent of voters approved <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">Question 3</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF], an indirect initiated statute that will <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">allow marijuana use by patients</a> [<em>Harvard Crimson</em> report] with "debilitating medical conditions" and create 35 medical marijuana dispensaries. Conversely, the <a href="http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/Documents/2012%20Proposed%20Initiatives%20and%20Referenda/Marijuana%20Proposal%20Text%20for%20web.pdf">Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act</a> [Issue 5, PDF] was <a href="http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/232534/2/ISSUE-5-Medical-marijuana-measure-rejected">rejected by voters</a> [AP report] in that state by approximately a 52-to-48 percent margin. The measure would have allowed doctors to issue a certificate to anyone with a "qualifying medical condition" to grow, process and use marijuana. Also on the ballot in Montana is a veto referendum regarding a <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/2011/billhtml/SB0423.htm">2011 revision</a> [SB 423] of a 2004 law that established medical marijuana use in the state.]]></content:encoded>

The report was offered by UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/RashidaManjoo.aspx">Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile], who stressed the urgency for all levels of government to recognize female victims of rape and torture as a result of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] and to ensure that women have equal access to remedies and services, regardless of their ethnic or religious backgrounds. At the conclusion of her eight-day mission to the country, Manjoo suggested:<blockquote>As the government strives to assess and address the impact that the war had on men and how to ensure they do not place women at a higher risk of domestic violence, it should also recognize the experiences that women themselves faced during the war, and their entitlement to justice, reparations, and information and assistance on the missing and the disappeared.</blockquote>Manjoo will present the Human Rights Council with her final findings and recommendations next June. 

<p>BiH is still recovering from the impact of the Bosnian War which was fought from 1992 to 1995. Last week <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] called for reparations and greater recognition for <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/bosnia-and-herzegovina-time-republika-srpska-make-reparations-war-time-rape-2012-10-31">victims of sexual violence</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/amnesty-international-report-calls-for-reparations-for-victims-of-sexual-violence.php">report</a>] during the Bosnian Civil War. Bosnian courts have continued prosecuting individuals responsible for human rights abuses, especially surrounding the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/675945.stm">1995 Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=srebrenica+massacre">news archive</a>]. In June the country's war crimes court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bosnia-court-sentences-former-soldiers-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four former Bosnian Serb soldiers for their involvement in the 1995 massacre. A month earlier the same court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/two-bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-prison-for-roles-in-srebenica-massacre.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Dusko Jevic and Mendeljev Djuric for their role in the killing of 1,000 Muslim men during the massacre finding that the two Bosnian Serb ex-policemen were guilty of aiding and abetting genocide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='/topstoryphoto/frontalabama.jpg' vspace='3' height='107' width='107' hspace='0' border='1' valign='top' align='left'/><img src='/images/s.gif' height='113' width='2' align='left'/>[JURIST] Alabama voters rejected <a href = "http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011RS/Printfiles/SB112-enr.pdf">Amendment 4</a> [SB 112 text, PDF] on Tuesday, which would have removed references to segregation and poll taxes from the state's <A href = "http://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/">Constitution</a> [text], over concerns about language addressing the right to education. The amendment, rejected by a <a href = "http://www.gowbrc.com/election/race8.htm">vote of 61 percent</a> [Fox WBRC report], proposed to "delete those remaining 'Jim Crow' provisions of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, which have not been expressly repealed by vote of the people." The ballot text provided: "Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, to repeal portions of <a href = "http://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/CA-245806.html">Section 256</a> and <a href = "http://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/CA-888218.html">Amendment 111</a>, now appearing as Section 256 of the Official Recompilation of the Constitution of Alabama of 1901, as amended, relating to separation of schools by race and to repeal <a href = "http://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/CA-245809.html">Section 259</a>, <a href = "http://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/CA-245933.html">Amendment 90</a>, and <a href = "http://law.justia.com/constitution/alabama/CA-245952.html">Amendment 109</A> [texts], relating to the poll tax." All state laws pertaining to segregation and poll taxes were repealed by Federal mandate, thus their inclusion in the constitution merely serves as an anachronism. However, advocates against Amendment 4 were concerned that by repealing unspecified portions of Section 256, the amendment would also remove, "The legislature shall establish, organize, and maintain a liberal system of public schools throughout the state for the benefit of the children thereof between the ages of seven and twenty-one years," thus deleting the State's right to public education. Indeed, the amendment to Section 256 would have changed the language to allow the legislature a much broader freedom in public education: "The legislature may by law provide for or authorize the establishment and operation of schools by such persons, agencies or municipalities, at such places, and upon such conditions as it may prescribe, and for the grant or loan of public funds and the lease, sale or donation of real or personal property to or for the benefit of citizens of the state for educational purposes under such circumstances and upon such conditions as it shall prescribe."</p>

<p>The author of the bill, state Senator <a href = "http://www.arthurorr.com/">Arthur Orr</a> [official website] argued before the election that the amendment was solely about <a href = "http://blog.arthurorr.com/2012/11/there-is-no-good-reason-not-to-vote-yes.html">raising the status of Alabama globally</a> [official blog post] by erasing embarrassing racial references. "Old stereotypes and perceptions are dredged up to cast our great state in a bad light, at times discouraging companies from bringing new jobs here because of our past." The <a href = "http://www.myaea.org/">Alabama Education Association</a> (AEA) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://blog.al.com/school-journal/2012/10/support_amendment_two_but_vote.html">described the bill</a> [official blog post] as a "sheep in wolf's clothing": "Amendment Four would reinstate a former constitutional provision adopted in the 1950s that contains language eliminating the state's duty to educate all of the children of the state. This antiquated provision would again give life to words that say there is no right for our children to have a public education. Amendment Four could give education antagonists leverage to harm public education operationally and financially."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Before the referendum, the three strikes law would mandate a life sentence for a third conviction after two convictions for violent felonies. In practice, this resulted in a number of life sentences for "third strike" convictions that were lesser, often non-violent, felonies. It is estimated there are 3,500 inmates in California serving life sentences due to non-violent felony convictions. With the passage of Proposition 36, "third strikes" will result in twice the minimum sentence of the non-violent felony for which the citizen is convicted. Proposition 36 passed with <A href = "http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/ballot-measures/">68 percent</a> [state election materials] of the vote.

<p>California voters also declined to repeal the death penalty by rejecting <A href = "http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/34/">Proposition 34</a> [official ballot guide]. Proposition 34 would have repealed the death penalty and replaced it with life in prison without the possibility of parole. It garnered 47 percent of the vote. California has had several issues guaranteeing human rights for its prison population, including issues with <a href = "/paperchase/2012/09/california-urged-to-improve-prison-isolation-unit-conditions.php">prison isolation units</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/rights-group-sues-over-california-prison-solitary-confinement.php">solitary confinement</a> [JURIST reports]. In May 2011 the US Supreme Court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">ordered California to reduce its prison population</a> [JURIST report]. As of August it appears that California will be <a href = "/paperchase/2012/08/california-prisons-may-not-meet-standards-of-court-order-to-reduce-population.php">unable to fulfill that mandate</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Question 1 amends <a href = "http://law.justia.com/constitution/virginia/constitution.html#1S11">Article 1, Section 11</a> [text] of the state Constitution to "require that eminent domain only be exercised where the property taken or damaged is for public use and, except for utilities or the elimination of a public nuisance, not where the primary use is for private gain, private benefit, private enterprise, increasing jobs, increasing tax revenue, or economic development." It also amended the Constitution to require the government to define just compensation and prohibit the taking of more property than is necessary.

<p>Eminent domain has become a more contentious issue since the issuance of <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html">Kelo v. New London</a> [opinion] by the US Supreme Court in 2005. <span class = "casename">Kelo</span> held that "promoting economic development" was an acceptable "public use" taking under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text]. Since then, there have been various state and Federal attempts to limit eminent domain. In February, the US House of Representatives <A href = "/paperchase/2012/02/us-house-approves-bill-restricting-eminent-domain.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to prevent states from seizing private property for the purpose of economic development and create a private cause of action for property owners. Mississippi passed an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/mississippi-voters-pass-ballot-initiative-restricting-eminent-domain.php">initiative</a> [JURIST report] similar to Virginia's in 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A similar amendment in <a href="http://soswy.state.wy.us/Elections/Docs/2012/Results/General/2012_Statewide_Constitutional_Amendments.pdf">Florida</a> [Amendment 1, PDF; <a href="http://enight.elections.myflorida.com/Constitutional/Amendment.aspx">results</a>] was narrowly defeated by voters. The PPACA was a comprehensive <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">health care reform</a> [JURIST backgrounder] law passed in March 2010. The amendments seek to exempt residents from the PPACA's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">"individual mandate" provision</a> [text], which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, or be subject to a fee equal to either a percent of that individual's income or flat rate of $695. The measures are likely to be of only symbolic effect however, as the federal PPACA likely preempts state law.

<p>Earlier this year, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">report</a>] that the PPACA is constitutional, and that the individual mandate is a valid revenue-raising tax. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that was heard before the Supreme Court was brought by 26 states and additional organizations challenging both the individual mandate to purchase health insurance and Medicaid expansion included in the law. The ruling on the constitutionality of the act was highly anticipated by both politicians and the general public.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure, which was <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2012/11/07/montana-approves-measure-for-parental-notification-on-abortion/">passed</a> [<em>LifeNews</em> report] by 66 percent of Montana voters, would require abortion facilities and doctors to inform parents and legal guardians of minors under 16 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure. This requirement is not mandatory in case of medical emergency or if such notice is waived either by the minor in a sealed court proceeding or by parents. The new law would impose criminal prosecution and civil liability for violators. Also Tuesday Florida voters <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2012/11/06/florida-voters-do-not-approve-measure-to-stop-abortion-funding/">rejected</a> [<em>LifeNews</em> report] proposed <a href="http://doedoe.dos.state.fl.us/publications/pdf/2012/2012_Constitutional_Amendments_English_9-28-12.pdf">Amendment 6</a> [text, PDF] by a margin of 55-45 percent. The amendment would have prohibited public funds to be used "for any abortion or health-benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion." It specifically excluded situations of medical emergency, rape or incest.

<p>Abortion continues to be a heavily debated issue nationally and internationally. On Monday the US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] heard <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000616">Isaacson v. Horne</a> [case materials] to consider a new Arizona <a href="http://azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=2036&Session_Id=107&image.x=0&image.y=0">abortion regulation</a> [HB 2036 materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/arizona-governor-signs-bill-to-ban-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">report</a>] that would ban abortions after 20 weeks unless there is a medical emergency. Last month the US District Court for the District of Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">enjoined Arizona</a> [JURIST report] from implementing a <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/50leg/2r/bills/hb2800p.pdf">public funding law</a> [HB 2800, PDF] that prohibits funding for health clinics that perform abortions. In October the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/europe-rights-court-rules-against-poland-in-abortion-rape-case.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Poland's treatment of a 14-year-old rape victim who sought an abortion. The victim initially faced charges of unlawful intercourse by the Polish criminal justice system. The ECHR found violation of Article 8's right to respect for private life when the girl was hindered in her attempts to obtain an abortion. Uruguay in September <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/uruguay-lower-house-votes-to-legalize-abortion.php">legalized</a> [JURIST report] abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, subject to several conditions, by a vote of 50-49. In August South Korea's constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-korea-court-upholds-abortion-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] its abortion ban. Last year voters in Liechtenstein <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/liechtenstein-voters-reject-legalized-abortion.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to legalize abortion in the country after the acting Head of State expressed displeasure with the law and threatened to veto the proposed change.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In Maryland, <a href="http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2012/ballot_question_language.html#state4">Question 4</a> [text], often called "Maryland's Dream Act," passed with approximately 59 percent of the votes affirming the law's passage. The <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-11-06/news/bs-md-other-ballot-20121106_1_maryland-dream-act-congressional-map-tuition">measure</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report] allows for most undocumented immigrants who went to Maryland high schools for at least three years to "pay in-state tuition rates at a four-year public college or university if the student has first completed 60 credit hours or graduated from a community college in Maryland." The law was passed last year by the <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/">Maryland General Assembly</a> [official website] but was later recalled by a petition drive which suspended the law until a general referendum could be held by the state's electorate. The Maryland law is comparable to similar laws in other states but this is the first time a state's "Dream Act" law has survived general approval in an election.

<p>Voters in Montana also decided to affirm an immigration initiative on Tuesday. The state <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/montana-voters-approve-ballot-questions/article_5747ca00-252e-11e2-bad1-001a4bcf887a.html">voted overwhelmingly</a> [AP report] in favor of <a href="http://sos.mt.gov/Elections/2012/BallotIssues/LR-121.pdf">LR-121</a> [text, PDF] which requires proof of citizenship or documentation of being in the country lawfully before being eligible to receive "state services." The measure prevents illegal immigrants from obtaining student aid, state licenses, disability benefits, unemployment payments or employment with the state. Additionally, the measure requires that state agencies must notify the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website] of non-citizens who apply for state services.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/82Final.pdf">measure</a> [text, PDF] in Colorado will amend that state's constitution to declare that the people of the state find that "large campaign contributions to political candidates create[s] the potential for corruption," and seek laws to limit campaign spending, disclosure of contributions, and provide strong enforcement of campaign finance requirements. The Montana measure declares that state policy will be that corporations are not the same as human beings, and thus, are not permitted the same constitutional rights. The intended effect of the initiative is to "[prohibit] corporate campaign contributions and expenditures." The initiative further directs the state's Congressional delegation to introduce an amendment to the US Constitution that would similarly declare that corporations are not human beings. Earlier this year, Montana's century-old <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/mca/13/37/13-37-216.htm">campaign finance law</a> [MCA &#167; 13-37-216] <a href="http://peoplespowerleague.info/about/about.htm"> the 1912 Corrupt Practices Act</a> [PPL backgrounder] was struck down when the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-montana-campaign-finance-law.php">overruled</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/montana-high-court-re-affirms-ban-on-corporate-campaign-spending.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that upheld the Corrupt Practices Act.

<p>These actions come in reaction to the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>], which struck down a regulation that prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds for "electioneering communications" or for speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a political candidate. Some commentators have <a href="/dateline/2012/11/matthew-skeen-campaign-finance.php">noted</a> that states are resisting this constitutional interpretation by enacting statewide measures like these initiatives, and <a href="/dateline/2012/11/danielle-rudisill-campaign-finance.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-eds] for the need for increased regulation and transperency regarding campaign finances. However, the Supreme Court's decision in the Montana case likely extends the the ruling in <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> to the states, so the effect of the new measures is unclear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The issue in the first case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-982.pdf">Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-takes-10-more-cases-for-2012-term.php">report</a>], was whether a federal court has <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [text] jurisdiction over a party's challenge to the validity of a trademark if the owner of the trademark has agreed not to sue the party over alleged infringement. This case arose from <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/">Nike</a> [corporate website] challenging several shoes manufactured by Already, alleging that the company was using patented design techniques from Nike's "Air Force One" shoes. When Already filed a counterclaim challenging the validity of Nike's patent, Nike petitioned the court to dismiss its suit against Already as well as Already's counterclaim. Nike then issued a promise to Already that it would not pursue any further action because, as Nike's lawyer explained to the Supreme Court, "Nike concluded that [Already's] activities were no longer significant enough to warrant the cost of litigation." Already still wished to pursue its claim challenging Nike's patent, but Nike argued that since it vowed not to pursue litigation, there was no longer any "case or controversy" as required under Article III of the US Constitution. The district court agreed with Nike and dismissed both claims, and the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Nike_Inc_v_Already_LLC_663_F3d_89_100_USPQ2d_1621_2d_Cir_2011_Cou">affirmed</a> [opinion] that decision last year. The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> to determine both whether Nike's promise not to sue is broad enough to assure that it will not assert a future claim against Already if it infringes on the same trademark in a different way, and whether Nike has the ability to avoid an attack on its trademark validity by making a promise like this.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court also heard arguments on Wednesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1175.pdf">Marx v. General Revenue Corp.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/supreme-court-to-consider-challenge-to-attorneys-fees.php">report</a>]. In this case, the issue was whether a defendant who prevails in a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf">Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</a> (FDCPA) [text, PDF] case is entitled to attorney's fees even if the claim was not brought against them in bad faith. The FDCPA states that "[o]n a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award to the defendant attorney's fees." <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_54">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)</a> [text] establishes what is known as "the American rule," and does not allow attorney's fees to be collected by the prevailing party unless a statute, another federal rule or a court order awards them. In this case, the plaintiff is not alleging that the claim brought against her for collection of payments on her student loan were made in bad faith, but that she received phone calls and visits to her work that amounted to harassment. The district court ruled against the plaintiff and the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed that decision last year, ruling that the FDCPA requires bad faith in order for attorney's fees to be awarded, not just harassment. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on both of these issues after it finishes its fall term.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs, who worked for a private security firm in Iraq, were arrested in 2006 by military personnel after being suspected of dealing arms. The plaintiffs alleged that they were subject to torture tactics in military prison, including sleep deprivation, extreme temperatures, and denial of food and water. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs argued that Rumsfeld authorized harsh interrogation methods in Iraq and that victims of torture should be able to establish a private right of action against government officials. The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument as unworkable and contrary to the government's national security interests:<blockquote>[The plaintiffs] want a judicial order that would make the Secretary of Defense care less about the Secretary's view of the best military policy, and more about the Secretary's regard for his own finances. Plaintiffs believe that giving the Secretary of Defense a financial stake in the conduct of interrogators would lead the Secretary to hold the rights of detainees in higher regard&#8212;which surely is true, but that change would come at an uncertain cost in national security.</blockquote>Three judges dissented, arguing that the majority opinion set a dangerous precedent for future government immunity cases. The <em>en banc</em> decision reverses a Seventh Circuit ruling in August 2011 that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-rumsfeld-torture-suit-to-proceed.php">allowed the lawsuit against Rumsfeld to proceed</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Several Bush administration officials have been sued in recent years for alleged torture and illegal detention. In June 2011 the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website]  <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-rumsfeld-torture-suit.php">upheld the dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a torture suit against Rumsfeld brought by four Afghan and five Iraqi citizens alleging they were illegally detained and tortured. Also last year the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-98.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-98">Ashcroft v. al-Kidd</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that former US attorney general <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/ashcroft.php">John Ashcroft</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-ashcroft-immune-from-suit-over-witness-detention.php">immune from suit</a> [JURIST report] by a witness detained in a terror investigation. In February 2011 the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> and the <a href="http://www.ecchr.de">European Center for Human Rights</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the signatory states of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> [text] to pursue criminal charges against former president George W.

Other calls to investigate the criminal culpability of Bush and officials in his administration have been <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/mukasey-says-no-criminal-waterboarding.php">consistently rejected by US officials</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Manning was charged for allegedly leaking more than 700,000 classified government documents to WikiLeaks, which purports to be a whistleblower website. Manning <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/army-private-offers-guilty-plea-wikileaks-case-17670061#.UJvAtYVxs7A">offered his plea</a> [AP report] through a process called "pleading by exceptions and substitutions," in which the accused accepts lesser charges within the larger set of charged offenses. Manning's lawyer <a href="http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2012/11/pfc-mannings-offered-plea-and-forum.html">explained</a> [statement] that even if the government accepts the plea offer, it could still charge Manning with more serious offenses:<blockquote>If the Court allows PFC Manning to plead guilty by exceptions and substitutions, the Government may still elect to prove up the charged offenses. Pleading by exceptions and substitutions, in other words, does not change the offenses with which PFC Manning has been charged and for which he is scheduled to stand trial.</blockquote>Manning is scheduled to be tried by a military judge in February and faces a possible life sentence.

<p>Manning's case has engendered a great deal of controversy. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave argued that the <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">lack of transparency</a> [JURIST op-ed] in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June Army Col. Denise Lind, the judge in Manning's case ordered the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-to-review-allegedly-withheld-evidence-in-wikileaks-trial.php">withheld from the defense during discovery</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in June Lind <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-wikileaks-charges.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss eight of the 22 charges against Manning after his defense had argued they were unconstitutionally vague. In May UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez accused the US government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-the-un-special-rapporteur.php">cruel and inhuman treatment</a> [JURIST report] of Manning. The US military court referred Manning's <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-refers-intelligence-analyst%27s-wikileaks-case-for-court-martial.php">case for court-martial</a> in February after a US Army panel of experts declared Manning <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">competent to stand tria</a>l [JURIST reports] last April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The campaign featured pictures of Holocaust victims alongside images of animals kept in mass stocks. PETA argued that the use of the images was governed by <a href="http://human-rights-convention.org/our-rights-and-liberties/expression-2/">article 10</a> [text] of the <a href="http://human-rights-convention.org/">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [official website], which protects the freedom of expression. Under article 10 debates concerning public interest, such as animal rights, are afforded particular protection. The ECHR rejected PETA's argument, upholding the decision of a German court to bar use of the images in the campaign. The German court recognized the poster campaign was not meant to debase concentration camp inmates but found the "instrumentalisation" of the inmates' suffering violated the personality rights of survivors of the Holocaust. Furthermore, the German court found the use of the images could not be divorced from the historical and social context in which they were used and accepted the German government's special obligation towards Jews living in Germany. Based on these considerations, the ECHR decided the German court had provided reasons relevant and sufficient to uphold the injunction.  

<p>German courts have been called upon before to adjudicate disputes involving the freedom of expression and the Holocaust. In 2010 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/germany-court-convicts-uk-bishop-for.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] UK Bishop Richard Williamson of denying the Holocaust. Williamson's charges stemmed from a 2009 Swedish television broadcast in which Williamson doubted 6 million Jews were killed in gas chambers. Holocaust denial constitutes a crime under <a href="http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#130">Section 130 (3)</a> [text] of the German federal criminal code. As legislation is passed worldwide banning the denial of genocide, government's are increasingly being called to <a href="/forum/2012/02/vivian-curran-genocide-denial.php">balance freedom of expression and human rights</a> [JURIST op-ed].   </p>]]></content:encoded>

In her statement to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], Bensouda acknowledged the possibility that key Libyan war crimes suspects <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Saif+al-Islam+Gaddafi">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Abdullah+Al-Senussi">Abdullah Al-Senussi</a> [JURIST news archives] could be tried in Libyan courts rather than the ICC if Libya succeeds in its <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/libya-challenges-iccs-right-to-try-gaddafis-son.php">challenge to ICC jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report]. She encouraged Libyan authorities to take a stance against war criminals, regardless of which side of the revolution the perpetrator supported:<blockquote>My Office takes note of Law 38, granting amnesty at the national level for "acts made necessary by the 17 February revolution"; as well as Law 35, which purportedly ensures that any act found to be in contravention of international laws and human rights covenants will not be exempt. I encourage the new Libyan government, scheduled to be sworn in in the coming days, to ensure that there is no amnesty for international crimes and no impunity for crimes, regardless of who is the perpetrator and who is the victim.</blockquote>The prosecutor's office will continue its investigation of other allegations relating to the events and the aftermath of the 2011 revolution. Bensouda says she will decide the direction these other possible cases in the near future.

<p>The dispute over who will try key Libyan war criminals has strained relations between Libya and the ICC. In October,  Amnesty International urged the Libyan government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urged-to-turn-gaddafi-military-chief-over-to-icc.php">hand over Al-Senussi to the ICC</a> [JURIST report], expressing concern that he could not receive a fair trial in a national court. Earlier that month Libyan officials, in a hearing before the ICC, <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">promised a fair trial for Gaddafi's son</a> [JURIST report], Saif al-Islam, and urged the court to allow a national trial. Saif al-Islam said in August that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/gaddafi-son-says-he-will-not-receive-fair-trial-in-libya.php">prefer a trial in the ICC</a> [JURIST report] because he felt he could not get a fair trial in Libya. In June four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] by Libyan security forces. They were in custody for nearly four weeks. Upon her <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-staff-members-released-from-libyan-detention.php">release</a> [JURIST report], ICC lawyer Melinda Taylor said she did not believe Saif al-Islam would receive a fair trial in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled 7-0 against Pfizer on an appeal from Israeli-based <a href="http://www.tevapharm.com/Pages/default.aspx">Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.</a> [corporate website], the world's largest generic pharmaceutical company. The appeal was brought against Pfizer on the grounds that the company had not provided enough details of the active ingredients in Viagra when filing its patent, which was to run out in 2014. Justice Louis LeBel stated:<blockquote>The disclosure failed to state in clear terms what the invention was. Pfizer gained a benefit from the [Patent] Act&#8212;exclusive monopoly rights&#8212;while withholding disclosure in spite of its disclosure obligations under the Act. As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to 'game' the system in this way.</blockquote>The court agreed with Teva's claims, concluding that Pfizer "chose a method of drafting that failed to clearly set out what the invention was. Even now, in its factum to this Court, Pfizer offers no explanation as to why ... it elected to withhold that information." Without a valid patent for Viagra, the door has been opened for generic production of the erectile dysfunction drug. Barry Fishman, CEO of Teva Canada, declared in a <a href="http://www.tevacanada.com/Home/About-Us/CEO-Message/2012-02-17-ECC-Speech-February-16-2012_FA.aspx">recent address</a> [transcript, PDF] that with the rising cost of health care, "generic medicines are an important part of the solution&#8212;both now and in the future."

<p>Pfizer has appeared in court numerous times over recent years for issues of patent dispute and drug experimentation. Pfizer has successfully argued against Teva in the <a href="http://patentdocs.typepad.com/files/pfizer-v-teva-3.pdf">US</a> [complaint, PDF], Spain, New Zealand and Norway. In September 2009 Pfizer settled a <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/pfizer-settles-health-care-fraud-suit.php">health care fraud suit</a> [JURIST report] for a record $2.3 billion upon allegations that the company's drug Bextra was misbranded and promoted for "off-label" uses with the intent to defraud or mislead. In July 2009 Pfizer reached a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/pfizer-finalizes-settlement-with.php">final settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the Nigerian state of Kano over allegedly <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6721771.stm">illegal clinical trials</a> [BBC backgrounder] of the then-experimental antibiotic <a href="http://www.pfizer.com/files/news/trovan_fact_sheet_final.pdf">Trovan</a> [Pfizer fact sheet] conducted in 1996. The suit accused the company of administering meningitis medication to 200 Nigerian children, 100 of which included Trovan, without government authorization or guardian consent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California</a> (ACLU-NC) joined with the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [advocacy websites] to <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/docs/freedom_of_press_and_speech/prop_35_complaint.pdf">challenge</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/news/press_releases/aclu_and_eff_challenge_free_speech_restrictions_in_california%27s_proposition_35.shtml">press release</a>] portions of the <a href="http://www.caseact.org/">Californians Against Sexual Exploitation (CASE) Act</a> [campaign website], enacted by <a href="http://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2012/general/pdf/text-proposed-laws-v2.pdf#nameddest=prop35">Proposition 35</a> [text, PDF], that require all registered sex offenders, even those with decades-old misdemeanors and non-Internet related offenses, to turn in their Internet usage information to law enforcement. Focusing on the proposition's broadness and "constitutional infirmities," the complaint notes that Proposition 35 "require[s] registrants to provide information about online activities that have no possible relationship to criminality, such as the screen names they use to post comments about articles on a newspaper's website or names that they use to access political discussion groups." Judge Thelton Henderson found that plaintiffs' arguments merited a temporary restraining order (TRO):<blockquote>In this case, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have raised serious questions about whether the challenged sections of the CASE Act violate their First Amendment right to free speech
and other constitutional rights. In addition, the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of issuing a TRO. Defendant Harris's counsel represented to the Court that the State would be in no position to enforce the law until March 20, 2013. The harm to Defendants of a TRO therefore appears to be minimal. ... Plaintiffs, by contrast, would suffer the potential loss of their "ability to speak anonymously on the Internet," which is protected by the First Amendment.</blockquote>The EFF and ALCU-NC are careful to point out they support stopping <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=human+trafficking">human trafficking</a> [JURIST news archive], but disagree with some of the measures taken by this law. 

<p>Proposition 35 was <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/11/proposition-35-address-human-trafficking.html">approved</a> [<em>Los Angeles Times</em> report] 81 percent of California voters. The law seeks to increase criminal penalties on human traffickers, requires persons convicted of human trafficking to register as a sex offenders and implements human trafficking training for police officers. Some have <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/35/arguments-rebuttals.htm">criticized</a> [CA Secretary of State website] the proposition for being too broad, as it demands lifetime registration for even very minor sex offenses like public urination and can prosecute anyone for receiving financial support from a registered offender. This law might affect more than 73,000 Californians, who would also have to report any new accounts or usernames they create to law enforcement within 24 hours of their creation or face potential criminal penalties, including imprisonment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontgun.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Louisiana voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state constitution which creates the strongest protection of the right to keep and bear arms in the nation. With all 4,267 precincts reporting, unofficial results from the Louisiana Secretary of State show that <a href="http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11062012/11062012_Statewide.html">73.46 percent</a> (1,283,850 votes) [unofficial results] of the state's electorate supported the amendment. Before the amendment, <a href="http://senate.legis.state.la.us/documents/constitution/Article1.htm#">Article 1, Section 11</a> [text] of the Louisiana State Constitution read: "The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged, but this provision shall not prevent the passage of laws to prohibit the carrying of weapons concealed on the person." Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.legis.state.la.us/">Louisiana State Legislature</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://legis.la.gov/billdata/streamdocument.asp?did=812575">joint resolution</a> [text, PDF] proposing the amendment to the state's voters. With the amendment, Section 11 will now read: "The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms is fundamental and shall not be infringed. Any restriction on this right shall be subject to strict scrutiny." The legislature initiated the amendment process in response to the 2001 Louisiana Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.lasc.org/opinions/2001/99k3439.opn.pdf">State v. Blanchard</a> [opinion, PDF]. In that case the court  upheld a lower court's ruling on the powers of the legislature with respect to a citizen's right to bear arms say that the "right to bear arms is established by the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, &#167; 11 of the Louisiana Constitution. The State of Louisiana is entitled to restrict that right for legitimate state purposes, such as public health and safety."

<p>Gun control has been a controversial domestic and international issue in recent years. In 2010 the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1521">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] applied to states and municipalities as well as the federal government. The court's decision in <span class="casename">McDonald</span> followed its 2008 decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">JURIST report</a>], which held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self defense. Internationally, a deadline for approval of a UN arms treaty passed in July, after <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/deadline-for-un-arms-treaty-passes-without-consensus.php">treaty opponents in the US urged</a> [JURIST report] President Barach Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not to support the agreement if it contained provisions applying to civilian arms possession.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, the jury found that Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/">FaceTime</a> [product backgrounder] function, which is used on its iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Mac computer products, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/virnetx-says-jury-asks-apple-pay-368-million-183902692--finance.html">infringed patents</a> [Reuters report] held by <a href="http://virnetx.com/">VirnetX</a> [corporate website], a commercial software and technology solutions company located in Zephyr Cove, Nevada. In its defense, Apple unsuccessfully argued that its own technology is much different than that of VirnetX, which provides only a small part of a large array of complex technological products.This is the second million-dollar verdict for VirnetX, which <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/17/us-microsoft-virnetx-settlement-idUSTRE64G39620100517">won a $200 million settlement</a> [Reuters report] in 2010 from <a href="www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Corp.</a> [corporate website] regarding the same technology. Post-trial motions in the present case are expected to be heard within the coming weeks.

<p>Apple has been embroiled in continuous patent litigation, particularly with <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> [corporate website] in courts around the world, with multiple rulings within the last month alone. Some commentators have noted that this legal strategy has been an effort to <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">influence the marketplace from the courtroom</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] ruled that that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">Samsung violated the Tariff Act of 1930</a> [JURIST report] when it infringed four intellectual property patents held by Apple. Earlier in October, the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">Samsung did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] an Apple software patent for user input and date manipulation through a "multi-touch" touch screen. Similarly, a UK court also ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">Samsung did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. In mid-October, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of the month, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Despite <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/malawi-enacts-moratorium-on-anti-gay-laws.php">announcing a moratorium</a> [JURIST report] that would suspend the laws to allow the country to consider their permanent nullification, Malawai Minister of Justice Ralph Kasambara claims that there was <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-malawi-gaysbre8a70xj-20121108,0,1924656.story">no such announcement</a> [Reuters report]. Other ministry officials have asserted that the <a href="http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/regions/africa/malawi/mcc.html">Malawai Council of Churches</a> [World Council of Churches backgrounder], a group of 24 Protestant churches, has applied enough pressure to force the immediate change.The laws at issue, <a href="http://ilga.org/historic/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2008.pdf">Section 153 and 156</a> [ILGA backgrounder, PDF] of Malawi's Penal Code, stipulate 14 years or five years imprisonment, respectively, for anyone engaging in male homosexual activity or relationships. This year, the law prompted the international community to reduce their aid to Malawi.

<p>Homosexuality is illegal in 36 African nations, and South Africa is the only country on the continent where <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18118350">same-sex marriage is not prohibited</a> [BBC report]. In May Malawi President Joyce Banda <a href="http://www.nyasatimes.com/malawi/2012/05/18/malawi-president-bandas-state-of-the-nation-address-in-full/">announced in her first national address</a> [text] that she would <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/malawi-president-vows-to-decriminalize-homosexuality.php">decriminalize homosexual acts</a> [JURIST report]. This announcement came as a move to normalize relations with Malawi's development partners in response to <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">Obama Administration</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-to-use-foreign-aid-diplomacy-to-advance-lgbt-rights-globally.php">pledging to promote LGBT rights when granting foreign aid</a> [JURIST report]. In September 2010 UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The shooting also injured thirteen people, including former congresswoman <a href="http://www.giffordsforcongress.com/">Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AZ) [campaign website]. Judge Larry A. Burns <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/life-sentence-ariz-attack-wounded-giffords-191558574.html">sentenced</a> [AP report] Loughner to serve seven life sentences: six for the six people he killed and a seventh for his assassination attempt on Gifford. Loughner pleaded guilty to the charges, enabling him to avoid the death sentence. The shooting took place during a meet-and-greet outside a supermarket. Giffords was in the courtroom to hear Burns announce Loughner's sentence. It was the first time that Giffords had confronted Loughner.

<p>In August Loughner <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/jurist-the-man-charged-with.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST post] to 19 of 49 charges, including killing a 9-year-old girl and Chief Judge <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/john_roll/index.html">John Roll</a> [NYT backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website], as well as wounding Giffords. In ending an ongoing debate between prosecutors and defense counsel, the judge found that Loughner understood in court that he was responsible for opening fire during Giffords's local constituent meeting in an Arizona parking lot. Both sides then arranged Loughner's ensuing plea, which assuredly sidestepped the death penalty. Loughner was formally <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/charges-filed-in-shooting-death-of-arizona-federal-judge.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with the Tucson shootings in January 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Attorneys on both sides <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-11-08/federal-judge-urged-to-approve-bp-settlement">urged</a> [AP report] Judge Carl Barbier to approve the settlement agreement, under which BP is expected to pay approximately $7.8 billion to settle the claims against the company. BP also agreed to pay $600 million for the plaintiffs' attorney fees. The judge initially approved the settlement agreement in May, after which thousands of individuals opted out of individually pursuing their claims against BP. Barbier said that the hearing would help him to determine a fair settlement. He also indicated that some of the objections posed during the hearing were not made in good faith. Barbier is expected to rule on the settlement agreement in the next few days.

<p>In May Barbier signed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/dnp-1.php">case management order</a> [JURIST report] outlining the structure for the upcoming trial of Gulf oil spill claims, scheduled for January 14, 2013. Barbier divided the trial into two phases. In phase one, or the "incident" phase, the court will address issues arising out of the various parties' conduct leading to the incident and appropriation of their negligence. Barbier gave <a href="/2012/05/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-gulf-oil-spill-settlement.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to the proposed settlement agreement earlier that month. In April BP and a group of plaintiffs' attorneys <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/bp-asks-federal-judge-to-accept-terms-of-gulf-oil-spill-settlement.php">sought Barbier's preliminary approval</a> on the settlement, which they had <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/bp-reaches-settlement-agreement-with-gulf-oil-spill-victims.php">reached</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Krajisnik was <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 of persecution, extermination, murder, deportation and inhumane acts during the 1992-95 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive]. He was sentenced to 27 years in a British prison and given credit for time served since April 2000. A report on Krajisnik's conduct in prison stated that his behavior had been exemplary and that he should be released after serving less than two-thirds of his sentence. ICTY President <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ls/meron_bio.pdf">Theodor Meron</a> [official profile] rejected Krajisnik's request citing the gravity of the crimes he committed:<blockquote>Although there is evidence that Krajisnik has been rehabilitated and that the risk of his committing a new crime once released is low, Krajisnik was convicted of crimes of a very high gravity, involving widespread displacement of the non-Serb population in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which caused great suffering. Moreover, Krajisnik will not have served two-thirds of his sentence until August 2013, and the practice of the Tribunal is to consider the eligibility of a convicted person only after he has served two-thirds of his sentence.</blockquote>The severity of Krajisnik's crimes was also the stated reason for the denial of his <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icty-denies-early-release-of-former-serb-parliament-head.php">previous appeal</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Since his transfer to the UK, Krajisnik had previously been denied early release twice, in July 2011 and July 2010. At Krajisnik's 2006 trial, the ICTY found him not guilty on a charge of genocide for which prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/icty-prosecutors-seek-life-sentence.php">requested a life sentence</a> [JURIST report]. He was instead sentenced to 27 years imprisonment. Krajisnik was initially indicted together with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=plavsic">Biljana Plavsic</a> [JURIST news archive], the former Bosnian Serb president, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2003 after testifying against Krajisnik. Former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive], with whom Krajisnik worked closely, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested</a> in 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/karadzic-opens-defense-before-icty.php">currently faces war crimes charges</a> [JURIST reports] before the ICTY.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW: Abused migrant women fear deportation from Belgium</title>

The 57-page report, entitled "'The Law was Against Me': Migrant Women's Access to Protection for Family Violence in Belgium," found that women who immigrate to Belgium to join their spouse or partner are at risk of deportation if they report domestic violence while their residence status is being confirmed. The HRW report stated that Belgium's laws do not "protect family migrant women who flee violence when their application for family reunification is still being processed, or women whose violent spouse left the country after they sought help. Undocumented migrant women are also unable to benefit from the law." Additionally, HRW claims that these victims of domestic violence, especially those who remain undocumented, have inadequate access to shelters, limiting their ability to escape their abusers. According to the report, "the fear that reporting violence and leaving a partner may jeopardize immigration status means that migrant women who experience violence at the hand of their partners may choose to endure the abuse until they have a more secure legal status." Belgium has signed, but has not yet ratified, the <a href="http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm">Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence</a> [text], which requires countries to ensure the protection of all women regardless of migrant status. 

<p>Discrimination and violence against women continues to be a global issue. In October the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on discrimination against women</a> [official website] urged governments around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-un-working-group.php">repeal laws that criminalize adultery</a> [JURIST report]. In September HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-urges-reform-of-bangladesh-personal-laws-that-discriminate-against-women.php">urged Bangladesh to reform</a> [JURIST report] their discriminatory personal laws governing marriage, separation and divorce.  In June HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/sudans-death-by-stoning-violates-international-laws-hrw.php">called on the Sudanese government</a> [JURIST report] to reform its discriminatory laws and abolish both the death penalty and all corporal punishment after a young Sudanese woman was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. In March HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-human-rights-watch-hrw-1.php">urged the Afghan government</a> [JURIST report] to release about 400 women and girls who were imprisoned for "moral crimes," including flight from unlawful forced marriage or domestic violence in addition to "zina," which is a sexual relationship outside of marriage due to rape or forced prostitution. In July 2011 <a href="http://www.unwomen.org/">UN Women</a> [official website] released a report examining the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/women-still-facing-global-discrimination-un.php">persistent discrimination against women</a> [JURIST report] around the world and concluded that the rule of law does not provide adequate protection for women in practice. A month earlier a UN Special Rapporteur stated that even the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php">US is facing continued violence against women</a> [JURIST report], especially poor, minority and immigrant women. In May 2011 the <a href="http://hub.coe.int/web/coe-portal">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/council-of-europe-launches-international-treaty-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] the first international convention to combat violence against women. In the same month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-tunisia-egypt-to-protect-womens-rights.php">urged Tunisia and Egypt</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that women's rights receive constitutional protection.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The full range of <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/November12/LipkinPleaPR/Lipkin,%20Irwin%20S9%20Information.pdf">charges</a> [text, PDF] to which Lipkin has pleaded guilty include conspiracy to commit securities fraud, to make false filings with the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Security Exchanges Commission</a> (SEC) [official website], and to falsify statements in relation to documents required by <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/retirement/erisa.htm#.UJ1AhmcZysE">Employer Retirement Income Securities Act</a> (ERISA) [DOL backgrounder], as well as a substantive count of falsifying statements in relation to documents required by ERISA. The former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] employee has been accused by the FBI, Department of Labor, and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/">US Attorney for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] of working at Madoff's behest. US Attorney Preet Bharara commented:<blockquote>As only the third employee of BLMIS, Irwin Lipkin had a long history with Bernie Madoff, and he proved himself to be a loyal foot soldier&#8212;consistently and repeatedly breaking the law at his boss' behest, and leaving as his legacy a successor he personally taught to continue cooking the books. And the benefits went both ways&#8212;Lipkin was able to enrich himself and his family through fake trades, and no-show jobs during his tenure and thereafter. Today's guilty plea marks another step forward in our efforts to prosecute and punish anyone and everyone who we can prove participated in this breathtaking fraud.</blockquote>Lipkin faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, as well as criminal fines up to twice the gross gain or loss derived from the offenses. The sentencing is set for March 22. As part of the plea bargain, he has agreed to forfeit $170 billion of real and personal property, which will go towards compensating the victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme.  

<p>Lipkin is one of several former Madoff employees who have pleaded guilty to involvement in the Ponzi scheme. Madoff's brother, Peter, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/madoff-brother-pleads-guilty-in-connection-with-ponzi-scheme.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in June of this year. In March Madoff trustee Irving Picard and the owners of the New York Mets <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/madoff-trustee-reaches-settlement-with-mets-owners.php">reached a $162 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] for victims of the Ponzi scheme to avoid a trial. Former outside accountant for Madoff, David Friehling, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-madoff-accountant-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to fraud charges in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York in November 2009. Madoff himself <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">received a 150-year sentence</a> [JURIST report].

The Supreme Court's decision affirms the <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20121109_U_S__Supreme_Court_affirms_stay_of_execution_for_Hubert_L__Michael_Jr_.html">14-day stay of execution</a> [<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> report] allowed by the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] earlier on Thursday. The Third Circuit also requested that US District Judge John Jones III, a judge for the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website], explain his decision to allow Michael further appeals pursuing his stay of execution after initially denying the petition.

<blockquote>In addition to setting forth reasons supporting his request for access to interviews with the professionals identified in his previous motion, this petition also requested that Applicant be granted access to information concerning him provided to the Board of Pardons by the common pleas court, the Department of Corrections, and others; that Applicant's counsel be permitted to interview current and former corrections officers in preparation for the clemency hearing; that the hearing be stayed until these requests were accommodated; and that Applicant's execution be stayed to ensure a fair and meaningful hearing.</blockquote>Michael was convicted for the 1993 kidnapping and murder of 16-year-old Trista Eng.  

<p>US opinions on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] remain mixed. Earlier this week California voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/california-modifies-three-strikes-law-keeps-death-penalty-in-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Proposition 34, which would have repealed the practice in the state. In the wake of <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/connecticut-governor-signs-death-penalty-repeal-bill.php">Connecticut's repeal of the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] last April, Hotline contributor Ben Jones <a href="/hotline/2012/05/ben-jones-capital-punishment.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that "frustration with the practice had been growing for years." Connecticut became the seventeenth state to abolish the death penalty and the fifth to do so in the past five years. <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois</a> [JURIST reports] have all recently eliminated the death penalty, while 34 states retain its use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

From 2004 to 2009, MoneyGram processed thousands of transactions obtained by MoneyGram agents through fraudulent means: <blockquote>The scams&#8212;which generally targeted the elderly and other vulnerable groups&#8212;included posing as victim's relatives in urgent need of money and falsely promising victims large cash prizes, various high-ticket items for sale over the Internet at deeply discounted prices or employment opportunities as "secret shoppers." In each case, the perpetrators required the victims to send them funds through MoneyGram's money transfer system. Despite thousands of complaints by customers who were victims of fraud, MoneyGram failed to terminate agents that it knew were involved in scams.</blockquote>As part of the agreement, MoneyGram forfeited $100 million dollars that will go towards the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/vns/">Victim Asset Recovery Program</a> (VRAP) [official website]. MoneyGram also agreed to enforce US anti-fraud and anti-money laundering standards and maintain greater oversight of their agents' activity.

<p>Friday's announcement was the latest development in the federal prosecution of fraudulent practices. Last week <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">Wells Fargo</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/wells-fargo-challenges-lawsuit-by-us-government.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit filed by the US government to recover money from defective mortgages was barred by a previous settlement. In September a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/court-approves-settlement-in-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a settlement agreement between the DOJ and certain e-book publishers in a price-fixing suit. In late July a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-court-grants-emergency-order-freezing-trader-assets-in-sec-case.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an emergency order freezing the assets of foreign brokers accused of insider trading. Earlier that month, the DOJ and pharmaceutical giant <a href="http://www.gsk.com/">GlaxoSmithKline</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/glaxosmithkline-settles-health-care-fraud-case-for-3-billion.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a $3 billion dollar settlement in a series of criminal and civil healthcare fraud cases against the drug company.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the referendum was <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/politics/2019636466_gaymarriage09m.html">too close to call</a> [<em>Seattle Times</em> report] for most of the week, the measure to legalize same-sex marriage finally passed with approximately <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/results/current/Referendum-Measure-No-74-Concerns-marriage-for-same-sex-couples_ByCounty.html">52.55 percent</a> [materials] of the statewide vote.

<p>In June <a href="http://preservemarriagewashington.com/threat.php">Preserve Marriage Washington</a> [advocacy website] presented more than 200,000 referendum signatures to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/washington-same-sex-marriage-referendum-to-appear-on-ballot.php">put Referendum 74 on the ballot</a>, submitting the signatures and thus suspending the legislation <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/washington-same-sex-marriage-law-postponed-by-referendum-filing.php">one day before</a> [JURIST reports] the law was scheduled to take effect.

Holder</a> [docket, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-96-Shelby-County-v-Holder-Petition-for-a-Writ-of-Certiorari.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether Congress exceeded its authority when it renewed Section 5 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Section 5 requires jurisdictions with a history of preventing minority groups from voting to receive preclearance from the US <a href="http://justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> or a three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official websites] before making any changes to their voting laws. Shelby County, Alabama, which is a jurisdiction covered by Section 5, has contended that Section 5 violates state sovereignty under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentx">Tenth Amendment</a> and also exceeds Congress' authority under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxv">Fifteenth Amendments</a> [text]. The case is on appeal from the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] which <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12404661053692590457&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">upheld the constitutionality of Section Five</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/appeals-court-upholds-key-provision-of-the-voting-rights-act.php">report</a>].

<p>The court also agreed to hear <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/maryland-v-king/">Maryland v. King</a> [docket, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-207-Maryland-v-King-SCOTUS-petition-Final-Draft.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] which concerns whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] permits states to collect DNA samples from individuals charged with serious crimes. The respondent in the case, Alonzo King, challenged the validity of Maryland's <a href="http://www.goccp.maryland.gov/dna/documents/legislation.pdf">DNA Collection Act</a> [text, PDF] after state officials used his DNA to implicate him in a later crime. In July Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Chief Justice John Roberts</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/supreme-court-stays-maryland-injunction-on-state-dna-collection-law.php">issued a temporary stay</a> [JURIST report] that blocked a ruling by the <a href="http://www.courts.state.md.us/coappeals/">Maryland Court of Appeals</a> [official website] that barred police from collecting DNA from criminal suspects without a warrant.</p>

<p>The court also granted <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/peugh-v-united-states/">Peugh v. United States</a> [docket, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-62-Peugh-Pet-App-OK-TO-PRINT-7-16-12.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether a court violated the US Constitution's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ex_post_facto">Ex Post Facto Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] when it applied the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2011_Guidelines/index.cfm">US Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials] at the time of the sentencing rather than at the time of the offense. The petitioner in the case, Marvin Peugh, argued that the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] erred when it used the 2009 sentencing guidelines rather than the guidelines that were in place in 1998, the year he committed the crime in question. There is a circuit split among the US Courts of Appeals over whether a court violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it sentences a criminal defendant based on the guidelines at the time of the sentencing.</p>

<p>Finally, the court agreed to hear <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/american-express-co-v-italian-colors-restaurant/">American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant</a> [docket, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-133-American-Express-cert-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] which deals with whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [Cornell LII backgrounder] allows courts to nullify arbitration agreements if the agreements do not permit class arbitration of a federal law claim. The plaintiffs in the case are several retail businesses that have accepted American Express charge cards. They argue that American Express's arbitration clause, which forbids plaintiffs from filing as a class, violates the FAA. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/87ef44f0-26db-4347-82c1-6cfd46d1e6f5/2/doc/06-1871_2_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/87ef44f0-26db-4347-82c1-6cfd46d1e6f5/2/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in February that American Express's arbitration clause was unenforceable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This would end a seven-year class action against Visa and Mastercard alleging that they conspired with banks to fix the fees merchants pay when their credit cards are used. Although Visa and Mastercard representatives have said they are happy with the deal, some members of the merchant class, including <a href="http://www.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart</a>, <a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">Home Depot</a> and <a href="http://www.target.com/">Target</a> [corporate websites] have <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-09/visa-mastercard-fee-deal-falls-too-short-retailers-claim">expressed their opposition</a> [Bloomberg report] to the settlement. The <a href="http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=Dashboard&id=23&pmenu_id=17">National Retail Federation</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=Documents&op=showlivedoc&sp_id=7380">asked</a> [brief, <a href="http://www.nrf.com/modules.php?name=News&op=viewlive&sp_id=1444">press release</a>] the court earlier this month to reject the settlement agreement, said the proposed settlement "does nothing to keep these soaring fees from continuing to drive prices higher for American consumers, and would block merchants who believe in true swipe fee reform from ever having their day in court." Although it survived preliminary approval, the settlement will still be subject to final approval by the court.

<p>Earlier this year the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/presentation">European General Court</a> [official website], the EU's second highest court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/eu-court-rejects-mastercard-challenge-over-fees.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a challenge by MasterCard over its cross-border credit card fees. The court upheld a decision by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] that the fees violate EU antitrust rules. In 2010 the US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/doj-suing-credit-card-companies-for-antitrust-violations.php">filed a civil antitrust lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against MasterCard, Visa and <a href="https://home.americanexpress.com/home/mt_personal.shtml">American Express</a> [corporate website]. The lawsuit challenged rules utilized by the companies that prevented merchants from providing discounts and rewards for using credit cards with lower merchant fees. The DOJ contended that these rules unfairly inflate costs for both consumers and merchants. Visa and MasterCard agreed to a settlement that required the companies to allow merchants using their cards to express a preference for types of payments accepted, to offer discounts to consumers for using a particular card or type of payment and to provide consumers with information regarding the costs incurred by the merchant when a particular type of credit card is used. In 2008 Visa and Mastercard <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/visa-and-mastercard-settle-antitrust.php">settled an antitrust suit</a> [JURIST report] with <a href="http://www.discovercard.com/">Discover Financial Services</a> [corporate website] for $2.75 billion. The settlement was the result of a 2004 lawsuit filed by Discover after a DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f201200/201283.htm">suit</a> [opinion] determined Visa and Mastercard were in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by prohibiting banks from using Discover's services.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay said that since the government has not provided any evidence of serious misconduct by the staff member, it is in breach of its obligations under the <a href="http://unmiss.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=gpHXyf3LQ0k%3d&tabid=5100&language=en-US">2011 Status of Forces Agreement between the Government of South Sudan and the UN concerning UNMISS</a> [text], echoing the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-denounces-south-sudan-decision-to-expel-human-rights-investigator.php">statements of another UN official</a> [JURIST report] made last week. The South Sudan government said when the staff member was expelled that it was due to her publishing misinformation about human rights abuses to the international community. Pillay says this accusation alone is "utterly unsatisfactory and unacceptable." The expelled staff member is currently at a UN center in Uganda awaiting a decision on whether she will be able to return to South Sudan.

<p>South Sudan has repeatedly been criticized for its human rights abuses since becoming an independent nation. Last week <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/south-sudan-urged-to-abolish-death-penalty.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to a government official urging the country to abolish the death penalty and stating that its executions do not even meet the minimum international standards provided by law. After a visit to the country in May, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/un-human-rights-chief-comments-on-visit-to-south-sudan.php">noted concerns</a> [JURIST report] with the country's detention procedures, impunity among security forces, discrimination against women and minorities and capital punishment practices. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-south-sudan-to-prosecute-those-responsible-for-ethnic-violence.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the country's government in February for its failure to timely prosecute those responsible for an attack on ethnic minorities that killed thousands. South Sudan is still a new nation, only officially being <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-sudan-officially-gains-its-independence.php">recognized as an independent nation</a> [JURIST report] last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The conflict between the two companies arose after Apple initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/apple-files-patent-infringement-suit.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against HTC in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> [official website] in March 2010 alleging that <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/03/02Apple-Sues-HTC-for-Patent-Infringement.html">HTC infringed several of Apple's patents</a> [press release], and then Apple filed an additional suit to bar HTC from importing its products to the US. The CEOs of both companies stated that they were pleased to have settled the lengthy dispute and would now focus on innovation. The settlement terms are confidential. The companies also reached a 10-year licensing agreement covering the current and future patents of both corporations.

<p>The <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (USITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/apple-successful-in-barring-htc-from-using-five-patents-in-lawsuit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in June that HTC could not use five patents that it obtained from <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/">Google</a> [corporate website] last August in its case against Apple. In December, the USITC <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-trade-commission-rules-narrowly-for-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">ruled in favor of Apple</a> [JURIST report] in its claim against HTC for infringing its "data tapping" patents. A month earlier, the same agency <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-trade-commission-clears-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">found for Apple</a> [JURIST report] and held that the company did not infringe HTC's patents it obtained from acquiring the subsidiary S3 Graphics Co. In August HTC <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/htc-sues-apple-for-three-new-counts-of-patent-infringement.php">filed three patent complaints</a> against Apple after the USITC <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">ruled against HTC</a> [JURIST reports] for patent infringement relating to cell phones that run the Android operating system (OS) in July. After the initial lawsuit in March 2010, a second lawsuit was initiated by Apple in July last year when it <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/apple-files-trade-commission-complaint-against-htc.php">filed a claim against HTC</a> [JURIST report] with the USITC for patent infringement related to scrolling and touchscreen features.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to an exclusive <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jTkbDlRZVaYCWwMLmIJbl90JsJIw?docId=64bce3049ecf4994b1ba6486816c7dd4">Associated Press interview</a> [AP report], the ICC is specifically investigating crimes committed by rebel forces against Gaddafi loyalists and residents of Tawerga as well as further evidence against members of the former Gaddafi government. Tawerga was used to launch attacks on Libya's commercial capital, Misrata. The ICC is looking into allegations that rebel forces subjected civilians in Tawerga to killings, looting, torture and forced displacement. Bensouda also discussed <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Saif+al-Islam+Gaddafi">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> [JURIST news archive] who is currently being held by a militia group until he will stand trial. She urged the group to allow Saif al-Islam access to a lawyer and, while she encouraged the group to allow the ICC to prosecute him, should Libya proceed with the national trial the ICC "will continue to monitor what Libya is doing."

<p>The ICC, along with the international community as a whole, is closely monitoring the developments in the Libyan trial process. Earlier this week, Bensouda urged Libya <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-prosecutor-urges-libya-not-to-grant-amnesty-for-war-criminals.php">not to grant amnesty</a> [JURIST report] for war criminals on either side of the fighting. In October, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urged-to-turn-gaddafi-military-chief-over-to-icc.php">called upon</a> [JURIST report] Libya to hand over former military intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi to the ICC. Earlier that month Libyan officials, in a hearing before the ICC, <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/libya-urges-icc-to-allow-trial-for-gaddafis-son-in-libya.php">promised a fair trial for Gaddafi's son</a> [JURIST report], Saif al-Islam, and urged the court to allow a national trial. In June four ICC staff members who traveled to Libya to speak with Saif al-Islam were <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-staff-members-detained-in-libya.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] by Libyan security forces. They were in custody for nearly four weeks. Upon her <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-staff-members-released-from-libyan-detention.php">release</a> [JURIST report], ICC lawyer Melinda Taylor said she did not believe Saif al-Islam would receive a fair trial in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontireland.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Voters in Ireland on Saturday approved a <a href="http://www.referendum2012.ie/proposed-article/">constitutional amendment</a> [text] on children's rights that changes existing wording in the constitution to make certain rights more explicit. The new article focuses on making several case law principles explicitly protected in the constitution. First, the amendment repealed <a href="http://www.referendum2012.ie/other-articles-of-the-constitution/#article42-5">Article 42.5</a> [text] which outlines the cases in which the state may step in as guardian of the child. The <a href="http://www.referendum2012.ie/what-are-the-proposed-changes/explicit-obligation-to-protect-and-vindicate-rights-of-children/">new language of Article 42A.2</a> [Referendum Commission backgrounder] allows the state to take "proportionate" measures as guardian should the child's safety and welfare be at risk regardless of whether the parents are married. Second, the new article <a href="http://www.referendum2012.ie/what-are-the-proposed-changes/explicit-obligation-to-protect-and-vindicate-rights-of-children/">explicitly recognizes children's natural rights</a> [Referendum Commission backgrounder]. These rights were only implied through the constitution by the courts before the amendment. The amendment leaves the specific rights to be determined but uses stronger language to ensure existing rights are protected. Third, Article 42A.2 and 3 outline new measures to allow children of both married and unmarried couples to <a href="http://www.referendum2012.ie/what-are-the-proposed-changes/adoption/">place their children for adoption</a> [Referendum Commission backgrounder]. Previously, it was difficult for married parents to have their child adopted. Finally, Article 42A.4 <a href="http://www.referendum2012.ie/what-are-the-proposed-changes/best-interests-and-views-of-the-child/">explicitly recognizes</a> [Referendum Commission backgrounder] "best interest of the child" (BIC) as the primary factor in deciding these issues. While it was previously the common practice, BIC was not explicitly referred to other than in case law. In addition, the new article allows the views of the child to be given weight depending on their age and maturity. The amendment <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1111/breaking1.html">was passed</a> [<em>Irish Times</em> report] amid extremely low voter turnout and controversy surrounding the government's campaign for the referendum.

<p>The campaign for the referendum was highly contested. Controversy surrounding the government's information campaign prompted Ireland's Supreme Court to <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2012/1109/1224326366536.html">rule</a> [<em>Irish Times</em> report] that the information provided by the government was not impartial. After this ruling, several representatives <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1109/1224326364048.html?via=rel">called for the vote to be postponed</a> [<em>Irish Times</em> report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

This decision reverses a 2011 decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/philippine-high-court-to-allow-live-broadcast-of-maguindanao-massacre-trial.php">allow a live broadcast</a> [JURIST report] of the trial of several members of a clan accused of killing 57 people, including 31 journalists, who supported a rival political candidate. Philippines presidential spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said that the president is <a href="http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/381192/palace-asks-sc-to-allow-live-coverage-of-massacre-trial#.UKESEIY2REM">opposed to the high court's decision</a> [<em>Manila Bulletin</em> report], which could potentially impede the transparency of the trial. The 2011 decision to allow live broadcasting marked the <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20121112-383063.html">first time</a> [AFP report] in the Philippines that a trial would have been broadcast live.

<p>Although the high court's 2011 decision was hailed as a landmark decision, it did not give reporters free reign in the courtroom. At that time the court said it would not allow broadcasters to bring in their own cameras but would instead provide a single, stationary, widescreen camera. No panning or zooming was to be allowed, and broadcasters would have been obligated to show the entire proceedings from beginning to end each day, commercial free. The <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippines Department of Justice</a> [official website] had implicated Andal Ampatuan Sr., the leader of a Muslim clan in the Philippines' semi-autonomous southern province of Maguindanao, and several of his followers in the November 2009 slayings of campaign workers, journalists and supporters of family political rival Esmael Mangudadatu. The court noted that broadcasting the trial was important because of the impossibility of fitting the large number of interested parties into the courtroom, including the families of those killed and of the witnesses. Also in June 2011, a Philippine court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/philippines-court-freezes-23-million-assets-of-massacre-suspects.php">froze USD $23 million worth of assets</a> [JURIST report] owned by the Ampatuan family, who are accused of ordering the 2009 slayings, while investigators determine how the Ampatuans accumulated accumulated the assets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaker Rebecca Kadaga told the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/12/uganda-anti-gay-bill-2012-pass_n_2116584.html">Associated Press</a> [report] that the bill reflects the will of a majority of the Ugandan people. Religious figures in Uganda appealed to the parliament to pass the bill prior to Christmas as holiday gift, while protesters, including school children, paraded around Kadaga carrying placards that read "Homosexuality is an abomination." Kadaga said the bill will be considered in the next two weeks. Although homosexuality is already criminalized in Uganda, the bill envisages much more stringent punishments for homosexual acts. The bill includes <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16928608">life imprisonment for homosexual offenses</a> [BBC report] and subjects bystanders who fail to report homosexual acts to criminal liability. 

<p>The original text of Uganda's bill also included the death penalty for some offenses related to homosexual acts. In February of this year Ugandan MP David Bahati announced that clauses mandating the death penalty for "aggravated homosexuality" <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-to-drop-death-penalty-from-bill-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">would be dropped</a> [JURIST report] from the controversial bill. In November of last year the Ugandan High Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">sentenced a man to 30 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for beating to death prominent gay rights activist David Kato. In January 2011 the Ugandan High Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/uganda-high-court-rules-anti-gay-newspaper-article-violated-constitutional-rights.php">issued a permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] and awarded damages to three plaintiffs who were among 100 people alleged to be homosexuals by the Ugandan tabloid newspaper, <em>The Rolling Stone</em>. In January 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-proposed.php">criticized the original anti-gay legislation</a> [JURIST report], saying that it could harm Uganda's reputation internationally. In February 2010, US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">publicly denounced the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

His lawyer alleged that he has been denied access to his client for substantial periods of time, that Mahmoudi has been held in solitary confinement and that Mahmoudi has suffered a nervous background. Libya's government has stated that it is important for the country to try the previous regime's leaders to demonstrate that the country can provide fair trials and to help in the transition to the new government. If convicted Mahmoudi could face life in prison or execution. Mahmoudi joins <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/mauritania-extradites-libya-ex-intelligence-chief.php">Abdullah al-Senussi</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=senussi">news archive</a>], the former Libyan chief of intelligence, and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/libya-to-delay-trial-for-gaddafis-son-for-five-months.php">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Saif+al-Islam">news archive</a>] as former officials in the Gaddafi regime that are set to be tried by the Libyan government for their roles in the Libya conflict.

<p>Tunisia <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/tunisia-extradites-former-libya-pm.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] Mahmoudi to Libya in June. The extradition came a month after the Tunisian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/tunisia-to-extradite-libya-ex-pm-for-trial.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it was going to do so upon Libya's assurance that al-Mahmoudi would have a fair trial.

The judge ruled to not extradite Qatada because he could not receive a fair trial in Jordan where he is accused of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20295754">organizing bomb attacks</a> [BBC report]. Qatada has been described as "Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe," and UK officials believe he should be kept in prison for national security reasons. However, he has never formally been charged with an offense, and he has been in and out of custody either in prison or some form of house arrest. The judge stated that he did not believe that Jordanian authorities would mistreat Qatada, but Jordanian law allows the use of evidence gained as a result of the torture of others and thus Qatada could not receive a fair trial. Jordanian authorities had assured the court that they would not use any evidence gained from torture, but the court remained unconvinced. As a result of the ruling Qatada will be released on bail on Tuesday subject to a curfew and other restrictions. Qatada's lawyers stated that any restriction on Qatada's freedom was improper. UK prosecutors were very displeased with the ruling and announced that they plan to pursue an appeal and reiterated that they believed that Qatada was a very dangerous individual.

<p>The SIAC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada in May. In early February he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uk-court-sets-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] after he made an application for bail following the ECHR block of his deportation, but he was arrested again in April to begin deportation proceedings. Qatada was granted political asylum by the UK in 1994. When he was arrested in 2001 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, police seized a sizable sum of money in various currencies for which no explanation was given. Later in 2001, he went into hiding to avoid being arrested and detained under the then-proposed Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. He was arrested again in 2002 and held until March 2005 when he was released pursuant to a House of Lords judgment declaring his detention without trial to be unlawful. In February 2009 the ECHR ordered the UK to pay <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">&#163;2,500 in damages</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada after determining that his imprisonment violated the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=005&CL=ENG">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [materials]. Despite his previous grant of asylum and fears of torture and persecution, UK Law Lords in February 2009 ruled that Qatada <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-rules-muslim-cleric-can-be.php">could be returned</a> [JURIST report] to Jordan to face terrorism charges. The February decision overruled an April 2008 Court of Appeal decision <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-appeals-court-blocks-terror.php">blocking his deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Charges against <a href="www.moodys.com/">Moody's</a> [corporate website], a peer rating agency, were recently dropped after prosecutors conceded that there was a lack of evidence proving a manipulation of the market. This is the first European court case related to a nation's rating cuts.

<p>Rating agencies have received consistent criticism for not predicting the subprime mortgage debt crisis of 2008 and 2009. In general, many European policymakers contend that the agencies were too quick to downgrade EU nations in the face of various bailouts and austerity programs. In a procedural ruling last week, the <a href="http://www.cookcountycourt.org/HOME.aspx">Illinois Circuit Court of Cook County</a> [official website] <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324439804578105463318705392.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">ruled that the state's attorney general may proceed</a> [WSJ report] with a case accusing S&#38;P of misleading investors during the financial crisis. Also last week, an Australian court <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/news/2012/11/05/australian-court-finds-misled-investors/6krtHXsXxz9x6AneykwqvO/story.html">ruled that S&#38;P did mislead investors</a> [AP report] when it gave its highest investment rating to risky securities just before the global financial crisis. In August 2011, S&#38;P received considerable <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-36743736/post-downgrade-both-the-us-and-sp-are-defiant/">criticism from American policy makers</a> [<em>CBS News</em> report] after the agency downgraded the US credit-rating from AAA to AA+. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://apps.who.int/gb/fctc/PDF/cop5/FCTC_COP5_6-en.pdf">protocol</a> [draft text, PDF] was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20121112/as-skorea-who-tobacco/">approved by 176 countries</a> [AP report] during the <a href="http://www.who.int/fctc/en/">Fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the WHO FCTC</a> [official website], which is being held in South Korea this week. Pursuant to the protocol, signatories are encouraged to adopt and implement effective measures to control or regulate the supply chain of tobacco goods to prevent, deter, detect, investigate and prosecute illicit trade in such goods, and to take any necessary measures in accordance with their national law to increase the effectiveness of their competent authorities and services, including customs and police responsible for preventing, deterring, detecting, investigating, prosecuting and eliminating all forms of illicit trade in goods covered by the FCTC. Director-General of the World Health Organization Margaret Chan said:<blockquote>The protocol gives the world an orderly rules-based instrument for countering and eventually eliminating a sophisticated international criminal activity that costs a lot, also for health. Illicit trade is bad for health because it circumvents measures, like taxes and price increases, that are known to reduce demand. In other words, illicit trade seriously compromises effective implementation of the treaty.</blockquote>The protocol will go in to effect once it is ratified, but will not affect the US, Switzerland and a handful of other countries that are not <a href="http://www.who.int/fctc/signatories_parties/en/index.html">party to the FCTC</a> [list of signatories]. 

<p>The FCTC was adopted in May 2003 by the World Health Assembly and opened for signature through June 2004. In October Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev proposed legislation that would <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-pm-proposes-bill-banning-tobacco-advertising.php">ban tobacco advertisements</a> [JURIST report] and public smoking and raise taxes on tobacco products. Earlier in October the <a href="http://www.hcourt.gov.au/">High Court of Australia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/australia-high-court-upholds-tobacco-plain-package-law.php">published its reasons</a> for <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/australia-high-court-upholds-cigarette-packaging-law.php">dismissing a lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] brought by several large tobacco companies challenging new <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011A00148">labeling requirements</a> [TPP Act] that require cigarette packages to display graphic images warning of the dangers of smoking and ban brand logos. Similar issues have arisen in the US. In August the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that tobacco companies do not need to print graphic warnings of the danger of smoking, but in March the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that graphic cigarette <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/sixth-circuit-upholds-cigarette-warning-labels.php">label warnings are constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The court decided unanimously that the portions of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1256/text">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> [HR 1256 text], <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama in 2009 and designed to limit the tobacco industry's ability to advertise to children, are a valid restriction on commercial free speech. </p>]]></content:encoded>

During her visit to Indonesia, Pillay met with several government officials and the judges on the country's Constitutional Court. Although Pillay commended Indonesia for ratifying several international human rights treaties and for progressing in its democratic transition, she stressed the need to end discrimination in the country. Pillay voiced concerns over the violence in Papua and the country's crackdown on freedom of expression. In particular, Pillay emphasized the need for Indonesia to integrate its international human rights commitments into domestic law. Pillay stated: <blockquote>A fundamental principle of international human rights law is non-discrimination. This applies in all areas to all people. In terms of religion, the Constitution of Indonesia upholds this principle, stating that every person shall be free to choose and to practice the religion of his or her choice. Indonesia has a rich culture and history of diversity and tolerance. At the same time, it risks losing this if firm action is not taken to address increasing levels of violence and hatred towards religious minorities and narrow and extremist-interpretations of Islam.</blockquote>Pillay encouraged the government to set up ad hoc human rights courts and urged the government to respect the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression.

<p>In July an Indonesian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/indonesia-cleric-imprisoned-for-violating-blasphemy-law.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a Shia cleric to two years in prison on blasphemy charges. Chief Judge Purnomo Amin Tjahjo of the Sampang district court announced the sentence of Tajul Muluk, whose teachings were deemed to have deviated from mainstream Islam resulting in "public anxiety" over Muluk's pronouncements. In March the Jayapura district court in Papua, Indonesia <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/indonesia-conviction-of-peaceful-activists-draws-international-criticism.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] five men of treason for declaring the province's independence and raising an outlawed separatist flag at a peaceful pro-independence rally in October 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result of this delay, the EU will not require airlines to pay for CO2 emissions for the entirety of 2012 and will delay reporting obligations for these flights. The announcement came after the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Council met on Friday to discuss regulatory measures for curbing CO2 emissions from aviation. Following the meeting, EU Commissioner for Climate Action Connie Hedegaard announced that a policy group would be set up shortly and that there is reference to a regulatory Market Based Mechanism (MBM) that parties must agree to on a global level. The EU stated:<blockquote>Based on the encouraging results of the ICAO Council meeting 9 November&#8212;and the constructive engagement of our international partners in the relevant discussions&#8212;the EU is convinced that a global solution for addressing the fast growing aviation emissions from international aviation is within reach at the upcoming ICAO Assembly in 2013. As a gesture of good faith the EU will "stop the clock" on the implementation of the international aspects of its ETS aviation by deferring the obligation to surrender emissions allowances from air traffic to and from the EU by one year.</blockquote>The process of tracking and charging airlines for CO2 emissions will not begin until the 2013 Assembly in September or October of next year.

<p>Last December, the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/top-eu-court-upholds-airline-pollution-fines.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the EU law forcing foreign airlines using EU airports to pay fees for greenhouse gas emissions. The finding that the carbon emission fees do not violate international law, as several US and Canadian airlines had argued, was expected after ECJ Advocate General Juliane Kokott <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/eu-court-advisor-supports-pollution-fines-against-foreign-airlines.php">issued an opinion to that effect</a> [JURIST report] in October 2011. The foreign airlines had filed for judicial review of EU <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CB0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Feur-lex.europa.eu%2FLexUriServ%2FLexUriServ.do%3Furi%3DOJ%3AL%3A2009%3A008%3A0003%3A0003%3AEN%3APDF&rct=j&q=Directive%202008%2F101%2FEC&ei=zviNTuHRLuXi0QGntM0U&usg=AFQjCNG3d0Crac_UfZfi7exS3odpWjAwog&sig2=Pfb_AlcbjFFZ9ZjIxJY5Ng&cad=rja">Directive 2008/101/EC</a> [text, PDF], which announced that airlines would have to comply with heightened emissions regulations while using EU airports beginning on January 1, 2012. The airlines argued that the directive violated the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcgill.ca%2Ffiles%2Fiasl%2Fchicago1944a.pdf&rct=j&q=Chicago%20Convention%20PDF&ei=GfqNTsTdJerr0gHK2K0r&usg=AFQjCNENIqGbClCYwzTk-wSlqss58ZJrHQ&sig2=XM9RFDWQSRx1DIGo3UlFTg&cad=rja">Chicago Convention</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Funfccc.int%2Fresource%2Fdocs%2Fconvkp%2Fkpeng.pdf&rct=j&q=Kyoto%20Protocol%20PDF&ei=PfqNTsD-LaXj0QHlgpg0&usg=AFQjCNHukaAxko7B3nIYwCKVLF2Le2JGdA&sig2=sIy0HbXHMV_O8IdbDMyFHw&cad=rja">Kyoto Protocol</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gsa.gov%2Fgraphics%2Fogp%2FUS-EU_Transport_Agreement.pdf&rct=j&q=Open%20Skies%20Agreement%20PDF&ei=Y_qNTvGMKon30gHtr_A1&usg=AFQjCNHuTesv_YvOQG3zZnHFSAhRQQqMYQ&sig2=BjmxeDi7QO31r0HOtbYwRA&cad=rja">Open Skies Agreement</a> [text, PDF].

HRW not only emphasized the importance for ICC member countries to strengthen their efforts in making arrests of known suspects harbored within their borders, but also called upon the ICC to establish a stronger dialogue with the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] in order to facilitate arrests and prosecutions. According to HRW, the difficulty with generating arrests stems from procedural issues as well as political pressure brought against member countries and the UN Security Council. While the ICC must depend on member votes or referrals in order to initiate criminal proceedings, the Security Council may also refer cases to the ICC, but has been apprehensive in doing so due to, what the <a href="http://isn.ethz.ch">International Relations and Security Network</a> [official website] <a href="http://isnblog.ethz.ch/justice/missing-the-mark-the-icc-on-its-relationship-with-the-un-security-council">refers</a> [ISN article] to as, a constant struggle of "peace versus justice." HRW describes the civil unrest and violence in Syria as an example of a situation in need of accountability yet lacking in international response. Elizabeth Evenson, senior international justice counsel for HRW, was quick to point out that the ICC "has stumbled in getting the job done" while acknowledging the court's progress over the previous decade.

<p>The ICC recorded its first conviction in March 2012 in a case that not only sent Congolese militia leader <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/congo-militia-leader-found-guilty-in-landmark-first-icc-verdict.php">Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a> [JURIST report] to prison for his use of child soldiers, but also helped the court establish its guiding principles for providing reparations to victims. However, to the dismay of many, individuals such as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=joseph+kony">Joseph Kony</a> [JURIST news archive] of Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army and Congolese rebel leader <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-issues-new-arrest-warrant-for-congo-general.php">Bosco Ntaganda</a> [JURIST report] remain at large. Currently, the ICC has opened investigations in the Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, the Darfur region of Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Libya, and northern Uganda with 13 pending cases against 21 individuals from those countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearing was set to resume Tuesday, but the presiding judge <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/13/us-ukraine-tymoshenko-idUSBRE8AC0BK20121113">ruled</a> [Reuters report] that it was impossible to proceed in the absence of Tymoshenko and her lawyer. The prosecution accused the former PM of intentionally avoiding trial and stated that she ultimately has to stand against the charges. Defense counsel <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_13_11_2012_01">claimed</a> [press release], however, that the trial is fundamentally unfair because the judges have constantly ignored the defense's motions while frequently granting those of the prosecution and disregarding what occurs within the courtroom. Tymoshenko has been calling the trials against her politically motivated. The tax evasion trial <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/ukraine-ex-pm-on-trial-for-tax-evasion.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in April but has been postponed several times since then. 

<p>The trial against the former Ukrainian PM has sparked international criticism. In September the US <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">unanimously passed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.RES.466:">resolution</a> [text] calling for Ukraine to release Tymoshenko from prison. It condemned the current Ukrainian president <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/en/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website] for his role in the politically motivated imprisonment. In August the <a href="http://www.scourt.gov.ua/">Ukrainian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-high-court-denies-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-appeal.php">upheld Tymoshenko's abuse of office conviction</a> [JURIST report], reasoning that there would be no basis to rule in favor of the former PM and that the prison sentence is appropriate considering the charges against her. During the appeal the government denied allegations that the criminal proceedings against Tymoshenko were a measure initiated by Yanukovich to prevent her from participating in the October elections. The decision came only a day after the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/europe-rights-court-hears-tymoshenko-appeal.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] on Tymoshenko's appeal. Also in August Ukrainian prosecutors urged the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-prosecutors-urge-court-not-to-hear-tymoshenko-appeal.php">not to hear her appeal</a> [JURIST report]. Prosecutors told the court that Tymoshenko's trial had already established her guilt in the case, and asked the judges maintain her <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">seven-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] in the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report urged Libyan authorities to confront issues of xenophobia and racism, which may in part be inspired by the prevalent belief that some foreigners were "mercenaries" who had supported the ousted regime. The report is based on visits with 2,700 foreign nationals in detention centers throughout Libya between May and September of this year, including pregnant women, and unaccompanied minors held over migration offenses. According to AI, many detainees displayed bruises said to be linked to the abuse, such as being beaten with metal wires, water pipes and rubber hoses. Among other hardships, the report indicated women at the centers are vulnerable to sexual violence from male guards. According to Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at AI, despite the overthrow of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=muammar+gaddafi">news archive</a>] in 2011, undocumented foreign nationals currently face worse situations than before. 

<p>Violence and abuse in Libya has been a concern in the aftermath of the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST feature]. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-prosecutor-urges-libya-not-to-grant-amnesty-for-war-criminals.php">urged the Libyan government</a> [JURIST report] not to grant amnesty to war criminals. In March AI released a report accusing the ruling <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/libya-leaders-abusing-torturing-gaddafi-supporters-ai.php">allowing the abuse and torture</a> [JURIST report] of supporters of former leader Gaddafi by unofficial militias. Last year, AI released a report detailing similar <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-officials-urged-to-stop-prisoner-abuse.php">abuses faced by prisoners</a> [JURIST report] in Libya. The ICC also announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-no-immunity-for-perpetrators-of-crimes-against-humanity-in-libya.php">not grant immunity</a> [JURIST report] to any person perpetrating crimes against humanity in Libya. </p>]]></content:encoded>

One of Khalid Ali-M Aldawsar's possible targets was believed to be former US president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/georgewbush">George W. Bush</a> [official profile]. While Judge Donald Walter noted Aldawsari's youth and susceptibility to external influences, he found that the evidence was overwhelming, warranting a life sentence. A jury <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-usa-security-saudi-idUSBRE85Q1PG20120627">convicted</a> [Reuters report] Aldawsari in June of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. Aldawsari was arrested in February 2011 after federal agents found explosive chemicals, wiring, clocks, a hazmat suit and instructional videos on explosive devices in his apartment. Defense attorneys had argued that while Aldawsari had intent, he lacked a first "substantial step" necessary for conviction of the charges, but prosecutors pointed to the damage Aldawsari could have done with the explosives had Aldawsari successfully constructed a bomb.

<p>This is one of several recent cases dealing with attempted bombings in the US. Last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/millennium-bomber-sentenced-to-37-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] convicted terrorist Ahmed Ressam, the "Millennium bomber," to a 37-year prison sentence for a 1999 plot to blow up the Los Angeles International Airport on New Year's Eve. Also that month, <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nashiri">news archive</a>], accused of bombing the USS Cole while it was in port in Yemen in 2000, <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/accused-uss-cole-bomber-boycotts-pretrial-hearing.php">boycotted</a> [JURIST report] his pretrial hearing at the facility. In May a jury in the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/new-york-city-subway-bomb-plotter-found-guilty.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] naturalized American citizen Adis Medunjanin for his role in a conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway system in September 2009.

Bormes</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-federal-liability-for-credit-card-information-leak.php">report</a>] that the federal government does not automatically waive sovereign immunity through the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/tucker_act">Little Tucker Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] in the present case. The court held that the Tucker Act and the Little Tucker Act's waiver of immunity is set aside when a law that imposes monetary damages has its "own judicial remedies." The court determined this included the <a href = "http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/031224fcra.pdf">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA) [PDF], the law at issue here:<blockquote>Plaintiffs cannot, therefore, mix and match FCRA's provisions with the Little Tucker Act's immunity waiver to create an action against the United States. Since FCRA is a detailed remedial scheme, only its own text can determine whether the damages liability Congress crafted extends to the Federal Government. To hold otherwise&#8212;to permit plaintiffs to remedy the absence of a waiver of sovereign immunity in specific, detailed statutes by pleading general Tucker Act jurisdiction&#8212;would transform the sovereign-immunity landscape.</blockquote>The court did not determine if FCRA waived sovereign immunity and remanded the case to the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to determine that issue. Attorney James Bormes paid a client's filing fee through <a href = "https://pay.gov/paygov/">Pay.gov</a> [official website] and after completing the transaction, found the receipt exposed the last four digits of his credit card number, and the card's expiration, in violation of the FCRA.

<p>The court also issued several <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111312zor_l5gm.pdf">orders</a> [order list, PDF] on Tuesday. The court denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href = "/paperchase/2012/07/us-supreme-court-urged-to-hear-challenges-to-voting-rights-act.php">Nix v. Holder</a> [JURIST report], a <a href = "/feature/featured/voting-rights/">voting rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] case, after granting <em>certorari</em> last week in <a href = "/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-voting-rights-act-maryland-dna-collection.php">Shelby County v. Holder</a> [JURIST report]. The court also stayed the execution of Texas inmate Anthony Haynes to determine if his appeal will be affected by the recent <em>certiorari</em> grant for <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-grants-4-new-cases.php">Trevino v. Thaler</a> [JURIST report]. The stay provoked an unusual demonstration as Justice Sonia Sotomayor released a brief opinion on the stay and Justice Antonin Scalia dissented from the stay. Scalia argued that even if <span class = "casename">Trevino</span> could ultimately apply <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/supreme-court-rules-on-ineffective-assistance-of-counsel-claim.php">Martinez v. Ryan</a> [JURIST report] to Texas the issue in question has already been adjudicated for Haynes: "Even if the Fifth Circuit is incorrect and <span class = "casename">Martinez</span> does implicate Texas's system of post conviction review, a stay is unwarranted here because Haynes presents no plausible claim for relief. His complaint is that his trial counsel was ineffective at sentencing. The absolute most to which he would be entitled under Martinez is excuse of his procedural default of this claim, enabling a federal district court to adjudicate the claim on the merits. But that is precisely what the District Court already did on federal <em>habeas</em> review." Haynes was convicted of the murder of an off-duty police officer and has been on death row since 1999.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Richard Gergel asserted that <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Federal-judge-revisits-SC-immigration-law-4031469.php">90 minutes is too long</a> [AP report] to detain a vehicle, but that 38 minutes could be considered reasonable and may not violate the constitutional protections against unlawful searches and seizures conferred by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. In July Gergel <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-judge-declines-to-lift-injunction-against-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">declined to lift an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the law despite the recent US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision striking down most of the model <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">Arizona immigration law</a> [SB 1070, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>]. Gergel <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-blocks-portions-of-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">blocked provisions of the law</a> [JURIST report] from being enforced in December. Gergel is likely to issue his ruling in the next few days.

<p>The lawsuit against the South Carolina immigration law was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-judge-halts-south-carolina-immigration-lawsuit.php">put on hold</a> [JURIST report] in January pending the outcome of <span class="casename">Arizona v. United States</span>. <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a> is one of five states, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-governor-signs-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports] that modeled their recent immigration laws after Arizona's controversial SB 1070. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf">Arizona v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">report</a>] in June, lower courts have handed down a variety of rulings. In September, a judge for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-upholds-arizona-immigration-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial provision of Arizona's immigration law] that requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In August the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of Alabama's controversial <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama%20Immigration%20Law%202011.pdf">immigration law</a> [HB 56, PDF], upheld a few sections of the law and rejected part of Georgia's <a href="http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb87.htm">immigration law</a> [HB 87, text]. That same month, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on two anti-illegal immigrant laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The "State of World Population 2012" report details the reasoning for considering contraception a human right, the benefits of access to family planning and what this approach means for the international community going forward. The report specifically focuses on the benefits women and children in poor countries will receive should governments take certain steps to recognize the right to family planning. Investment in family planning, the report argues, is a necessary part of all reproductive health services. It argues:<blockquote>Recent estimates of unmet need indicate the significant levels of investment necessary to uphold the right of the world's people to family planning. High levels of unmet need for family planning will be increased in the coming years by the large generation of young people entering their reproductive years. Family planning has been shown to be one of the most cost-effective public health interventions ever developed. Thus any decision regarding how to invest in family planning must counterpose its costs against the range of benefits it brings to individuals, households and nations. ... Improved access to family planning extends life expectancy for both mothers and children, increases incentives to invest in schooling and other forms of human capital, creates opportunities for participation in labour markets, raises the return to participation in labour markets and results in higher incomes and levels of asset accumulation. These add up to significant benefits, particularly if declines in fertility occur quickly enough to generate a demographic dividend</blockquote>This is the first time the report has explicitly referred to access to family planning as a universal human right.

<p>The right to contraceptives, particularly funding issues, continues to be a global issue. Last month France <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/france-house-passes-bill-to-pay-for-abortions-contraceptives-for-minors.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to pay for contraceptive and abortion coverage for minors. The day before that, a US federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to rehear a Texas Planned Parenthood funding case. In September an Illinois appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/illinois-appeals-court-rules-pharmacists-can-refuse-to-dispense-birth-control-drugs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that pharmacists can refuse to dispense birth control drugs. Controversy still surrounds contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act <a href="/forum/2012/03/chad-flanders-religious-liberty.php">as it relates to religious freedom</a> [JURIST feature]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The WLEA is challenging the law, also known as the Budget Repair Bill, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/13/scott-walker-wisconsin-unions_n_2124723.html?">specifically as it pertains to law enforcement unions</a> [AP report] on the grounds that it violates their associational, speech, petition, advocacy and equal protection rights. The Budget Repair Bill was signed into law by Wisconsin <a href="http://walker.wi.gov/Home">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] in March 2011. The Wisconsin Trooper's Association, who, along with motor vehicle inspectors are exempt from this law, endorsed Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial election. The WLEA is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

<p>The Budget Repair Bill has been the subject of copious legal and political controversy since its passage in March 2011. A Dane County Circuit Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-judge-strikes-down-controversial-collective-bargaining-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the law as it applies to school district and local government workers in September. Wisconsin <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/wisconsin-ag-appeals-ruling-striking-down-collective-bargaining-law.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] days later. In July the <a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] refused to reopen a case challenging the Budget Repair Bill because of a justice's <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">refusal to recuse himself</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">upholding</a> [JURIST report] of the Budget Repair Bill in June 2011 overturned a Dane County Circuit Court's <a href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/host.madison.com/content/tncms/assets/editorial/0/f4/0ee/0f40eea6-87a7-11e0-8e93-001cc4c03286-revisions/4dde68047ba8a.pdf.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">report</a>] that struck down the law for violations of the open meetings rule.

After a week long investigatory <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/hearing-begins-for-us-army-sergeant-accused-of-killing-16-afghan-civilians.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/832">Article 32</a> [text], prosecutor Maj. Rob Stelle urged the presiding officer to subject Bales to a military court-martial where prosecutors will seek the death penalty. During the pre-trial hearing the court <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-robert-bales-hearing-afghanistan-20121113,0,2022106.story">heard</a> [LAT report] video testimony from witnesses to the attack who recounted stories of numerous shootings, stabbings and the immolation of still-living victims. Testimony was also given by other US soldiers who recounted drinking contraband whiskey and watching a Denzel Washington film about a man who goes on a retributive killing spree before Bales left the base in the middle of the night. At the conclusion of the pre-trial hearing prosecutor Stelle said the death penalty should be pursued because of the brutal nature of the act. Bales' civilian defense attorney, Lance Rosen, has challenged the assertions made in the hearing claiming that only one side of the story has been heard and suggesting that Bales' mental state might be at issue given that his toxicology report showed he had alcohol, steroids and sleeping aids in his system and that Bales may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The officer presiding over the hearing, Col. Lee Deneke, said he will submit a written opinion by Friday.

<p>Bales is not the first US soldier prosecuted in relation to deaths of civilians in Afghanistan. In February the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-drops-charges-in-afghan-civilian-death-case.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against Army Specialist Michael Wagnon, the last of five soldiers to be charged in connection with the killing of three Afghan civilians. In November US Sgt. Calvin Gibbs was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-army-soldier-convicted-of-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">convicted on 15 charges</a> [JURIST report] of murder, assault, and conspiracy in the same case. Before Gibbs was convicted, in March of last year, Army Specialist Jeremy Morlock <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-solider-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghan-civilians.php">admitted to three counts of murder</a> [JURIST report] as part of a plot with other soldiers to kill Afghan civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121114/AUTO01/211140366/Toyota-pay-25-5-million-settle-shareholder-suits?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE%7Cp">lawsuit</a> [<em>Detroit News</em> report] was brought by shareholders who argued that they were harmed by the company's recalls. They argue that the company's failure to disclose vehicle quality issues cost shareholders $30 billion in market capitalization. The settlement covers shareholders who bought shares between May 2005 and February 2, 2010. 

<p>In 2010 Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/toyota-agrees-to-pay-additional-32-million-in-fines-to-us-government.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] US federal investigations by agreeing to pay a record $32.4 million in extra fines for product defects and poor handling of a recall. The fines stem from two investigations conducted by the <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot7110.htm">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website]. The first, a fine of $16.375 million, concerned nearly five million vehicles with accelerator pedals entrapped by floor mats, which caused at least one fatal accident in California. The second, a fine of $16.050 million, resulted from Toyota's failure to notify the NHTSA of a safety defect in several Toyota models' steering relay rods. Toyota has been under federal scrutiny since December 2009, and has conducted several recalls. JURIST Guest Columnist Bruce Aronson says that recent corporate scandals in Japan, including the Toyota recalls, highlight the <a href="/forum/2011/11/bruce-aronson-corporate-governanace.php">need for the reform</a> [JURIST report] of that country's corporate governance structure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.sova-center.ru/en/misuse/news-releases/2012/09/d25412/">amendments</a> [SOVA backgrounder], called <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/%28SpravkaNew%29?OpenAgent&RN=129689-6&02">"On Amendments to the Criminal Code and Article 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation"</a> [legislative materials, in Russian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-lawmakers-expand-treason-definition.php">were approved</a> [JURIST report] by Russia's upper house of parliament, the <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/">Federation Council</a> [official website, in Russian] in October and make substantial changes to how treason is defined criminally. The new language of the law defines treason as "the provision of financial, material, technical, consulting or other assistance to a foreign state, international or foreign organization or their representatives in activities directed against the security of the Russian Federation, including its constitutional order, sovereignty, territorial and state integrity" which some fear could be interpreted to include giving even cursory assistance to any foreign national. Many feel this move by Putin is a thinly-veiled attempt to silence dissenting figures within Russia. 

<p>The Russian government has been cracking down on dissent in recent months. Members of Russian feminist rock band <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot">news archive</a>] were given two-year prison sentences after they were <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-punk-feminists-receive-2-year-prison-sentence-on-hooliganism-conviction.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August of hooliganism in connection with "guerrilla performance" of a protest song in February at the altar of downtown Moscow's Christ the Savior Cathedral. Since the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/russia-feminist-activists-face-trial-for-controversial-protest-performance.php">beginning of the trial</a> [JURIST report], the group's lawyers and human rights groups have said the charges were politically motivated by Putin to discredit his opposition. In July Putin signed a bill into the law that <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-president-signs-law-re-criminalizing-libel-and-slander.php">re-criminalizes slander and libel</a> in the country after <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/putin-signs-law-labeling-ngos-as-foreign-agents.php">signing into law</a> [JURIST reports] a bill that labels all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that receive foreign funding as "foreign agents" and requires them to register with the Justice Ministry just a week earlier.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdrc.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AFRICARegion/Pages/ZRIndex.aspx">UN Joint Human Rights Office</a> (UNJHRO) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/ZR/UNJHRO_HRVMasisi_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on Wednesday confirming the arbitrary executions of at least 264 civilians in Masisi Territory and North Kivu province of the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cg.html">Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (DRC) [CIA backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Democratic+Republic+of+the+Congo">news archive</a>]. The victims, including 83 children, were killed by armed groups in more than 75 attacks on villages between April and September of this year. UNJHRO teams conducting the investigations were unable to travel to most localities involved in the attacks prompting investigators to estimate the death toll. Thus, there is a possibility that the numbers are far higher than confirmed. Investigators have attributed the majority of attacks to the Raia Mutomboki and Mayi Mayi armed groups which have targeted ethnic Hutu civilians. Other attacks, targeting mostly ethnic Tembo civilains, have been attributed to opposing groups in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/fdlr.htm">Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda</a> (FDLR) [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. The report outlined other human rights violations in the area including large-scale looting, destruction of property, sexual violence and rape. According to the <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> (OCHA) [official website], at least 60,000 people have reportedly fled their villages in the region surveyed in the report. The ethnic element of the attacks is of particular concern in the region, which, for the last 15 years, has seen cycles of violence with strong ethnic character. Moreover, army desertions and the subsequent creation of the M23 armed group led the Congolese army to focus on efforts to contain this new rebellion, spawning an increase in violent attacks and human rights violations perpetrated by other armed groups in the region.

<p>The violence and unrest in the eastern part of the DRC has been a focus of the international community. Last month Ugandan officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uganda-official-denies-support-of-congo-rebels.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/index.shtml">UN Security Council</a> [official website] allegations that Uganda had helped assisting M23 rebels with troops and supplies in the DRC. Similarly in August, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court (ICC)</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/icc/">backgrounder</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-urged-to-investigate-rwanda-president-for-arming-drc-rebels.php">received requests</a> [JURIST report] to investigate Rwandan <a href="http://www.presidency.gov.rw/presidents-profile">President Paul Kagame</a> [official profile] for allegedly backing armed rebels in the DRC. In the same month, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/security-council-reaffirms-condemnation-of-democratic-republic-of-congo-renegade-soldiers.php">reiterated their condemnation</a> [JURIST report] of M23, demanding foreign entities cease aid to the rebel group.  In June, Rwanda was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/rwanda-urged-to-stop-assisting-drc-war-crimes-suspect.php">urged to stop</a> [JURIST report] assisting accused DRC war criminal General <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Situations+and+Cases/Situations/Situation+ICC+0104/Related+Cases/ICC+0104+0206/ICC+0104+0206.htm">Bosco Ntaganda</a> [case materials], who is wanted by the ICC.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In her statement, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Judiciary/Pages/IDPIndex.aspx">Gabriela Knaul</a> [official profile] noted that the situation of recent attacks on judges may escalate, seriously endangering the county's justice system. According to reports, investigations into the threats and attacks against the judiciary are insufficient to bring the perpetrators to justice. She stressed that the judiciary should be guaranteed independence from any inappropriate influence. In order to achieve this, the judiciary should not be subjected to dismissal or impeachment procedures except in rare circumstances, such as serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence. Even in those circumstances, the removal procedure should strictly adhere to due process and fair trial principles. With these principles laid out, Knaul also urged the local authorities to reconsider the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-to-begin-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">impeachment of Shirani Bandaranayake</a> [JURIST report], the chief justice and lone woman on the country's Supreme Court.

<p>The impeachment of Bandaranayake sparked heavy criticism among Sri Lanka's citizens. Earlier this month, hundreds of Sri Lankan lawyers and citizens <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-lawyers-protest-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] on the street in Colombo calling the government to halt to the impeachment. The impeachment was announced a week earlier after more than 75 percent of the parliament approved it, but specific charges against the chief justice were not revealed at that time. Tension continues to grow between the Sri Lankan government and the judiciary after an outspoken judge was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sri-lanka-judges-lawyers-protest-assault-of-outspoken-judge.php">assaulted last month</a> [JURIST report]. Sri Lanka is still struggling to establish rule of law in the wake of a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009. In July the government of Sri Lanka said that it may take up to five years to prosecute people accused of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder]. Earlier in July <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Sri Lanka to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">stop arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pakistan's Minister for Law and Justice, Farooq Naek, on November 9 submitted required documents and correspondence receipts to a five-judge bench headed by Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali. After review, the court officially <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/international/pakistan-supreme-court-withdraws-contempt-notice-against-prime-minister-ashraf/article4094716.ece">retracted the charge</a> [PTI report]. The court has sought the revival of charges against Zardari since January, but Ashraf delayed his <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/pakistan-pm-to-allow-switzerland-to-reopen-corruption-charges-against-president.php">promise to comply</a> [JURIST report] with the more recent June directive until September, when he assured the court that he would draft a letter to Swiss authorities urging them to reinstate charges against Zardari. The president is accused of using Swiss bank accounts to fund bribes of approximately USD $60 million. 

<p>Tensions between the country's judiciary and executive branch remain strong amidst the government's near year-long refusal to follow the high court's order to probe corruption allegations against the president. In August the Supreme Court granted Ashraf <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-high-court-grants-pm-additional-time-to-reopen-presidential-corruption-case.php">three additional weeks</a> [JURIST report] to urge Switzerland to revive corruption charges against Zardari. The court in April brought a similar <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/pakistan-high-court-convicts-pm-of-contempt.php">contempt charge</a> [JURIST report] against Ashraf's predecessor, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7310028.stm">Yousuf Raza Gilani</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Yousuf+Raza+Gilani">news archive</a>] for his refusal to follow the same January directive. After <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-pm-appeals-high-court-summons-in-contempt-case.php">failing to persuade</a> [JURIST report] the court that the president is immune from prosecution under the country's constitution, Gilani was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-court-disqualifies-prime-minister.php">disqualified</a> [JURIST report] from office and Parliament. As a result, some have since argued that Pakistan's judiciary is becoming too powerful. The conflict between the government and the court originally stems from an order that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2009, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nigeria-senate-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.nassnig.org/nass/index.php">Nigerian Senate</a> [official website] last year, and will undergo a clause-by-clause <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCRf89WaIa3yh95PdqUl-hEY111Q?docId=CNG.c99a1846a3c3c50df326c9cd3869f268.281">review</a> [AFP report] before it becomes finalized. The bill explicitly states that marriages entered into by persons of the same gender are prohibited and will not be recognized as valid, even if the marriage certificate is obtained in a foreign country. Individuals who enter into a same-sex marriage are liable for three years imprisonment each, and any person or group who aids a same-sex marriage contract is liable for a term of imprisonment of five years, a fine or both. Commentators have noted that the Nigerian criminalization of same-sex marriage would have ominous <a href="/hotline/2011/12/damian-ugwu-nigerian-marriage.php">implications for individual rights</a> [JURIST op-ed].

<p>Homosexuality is illegal in 36 African nations, and South Africa is the only country on the continent where <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18118350">same-sex marriage is not prohibited</a> [BBC report].

The report states that the four million women who have been forced out of their homes due to armed conflicts in the country are not adequately protected by Colombia laws and law enforcement. It claims that 37 percent of women in the country reported domestic violence in 2010, but for women who have been displaced the figure is higher, possibly up to 50 percent. HRW points out that even though the Colombian government has made progress in recent years enacting legislation to protect violence against women, the legal framework is often "not properly applied" and women are not receiving medical help or legal justice. HRW recommended that the president and legislative bodies of the country continue to implement laws aimed at providing more protections for women, and that agencies expand training and oversight of application of these laws and establish clear-cut "zero tolerance" policies to increase effectiveness of the legislation.

<p>Human rights groups have urged Colombia to improve numerous human rights situations in the country over the past few years, including putting an end to the country's internal conflict. Last month, the UN urged the country to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-experts-urge-colombia-to-reconsider-constitutional-reform-of-military-criminal-law.php">reconsider proposed constitutional amendments</a> [JURIST report] that would make it more difficult to administer justice for alleged human rights abuse victims. In February, the UN also documented <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-report-conflict-related-sexual-violence-is-a-global-risk.php">numerous sexual violence cases</a> [JURIST report] arising from the country's conflicts. Last year, the UN called for Colombia to end the violence following an announcement by the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/farc.htm">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] that it would release several hostages, believing that this action may be a sign that peace was within reach.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report raises many concerns regarding the UN's response to certain situations, including failure to meet the needs of civilians toward the end of the war. The report has been made public despite its criticism of the UN due to a desire for transparency by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website], who originally created the IRP. Ban said the UN is committed to improvement and learning from the report:<blockquote>Our obligation to all humanity is to overcome our setbacks, learn from our mistakes, strengthen our responses, and act meaningfully and effectively for the future. These principles and objectives drove me to establish the Panel and they will guide us as we take forward its outcomes.</blockquote>The UN still faces challenges in Sri Lanka, as approximately 20,000 people have been killed since protests against the country's president began less than two years ago.

<p>Despite the UN's admitted failed responses, the UN has urged Sri Lanka to improve its response to alleged war crimes since the end of the war. In July the country said it <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">may take up to five years</a> [JURIST report] to prosecute people accused of war crimes. In March the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-rights-chief-warns-sri-lanka-against-retribution-following-controversial-resolution.php">adopted a resolution</a> [JURIST report], which was rejected by Syria, threatening retribution if the country did not domestically investigate and cooperate with UN investigations of war crimes committed. The same day that Sri Lanka rejected the resolution, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-rights-council-urges-sri-lanka-war-crimes-probe.php">urged the country</a> to investigate its war crimes despite a Sri Lanka commission's release of a report last year that military officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/sri-lanka-report-says-military-did-not-target-civilians.php">did not intentionally target civilians</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Myanmar's state-run media reported that the government has released the prisoners on humanitarian grounds and as a goodwill gesture by the nation. However, Myanmar's main opposition party, the <a href="http://burmese.nldburma.org/">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) [official website, in Burmese] <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/myanmar-announces-release-of-452-prisoners/article/feed/2048399#.UKT6woVxs7A">criticized the government's decision</a> [AP report], saying that the government has not released any of the estimated 330 political prisoners currently incarcerated in Myanmar. It is unclear if any of the 452 prisoners released are political ones because the government has not provided details on which prisoners have been freed. Obama is scheduled to visit Myanmar on Monday. 

<p>Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently. Last month <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged the government of Myanmar to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-groups-call-for-end-to-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">end sectarian violence</a> [JURIST report] between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. In August Physicians for Human Rights reported that Myanmar's <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">army is still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state. Earlier that month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-myanmar-forces-committed-human-rights-violations-following-mob-violence.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar security forces of human rights abuses against a minority religious community. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-myanmar-ethnic-clashes.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about both the continued violence in Myanmar and the country's human rights abuses committed in dealing with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontscales.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Six Pennsylvania judges <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/113282218/pen-judges">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging a section of the <a href="http://sites.state.pa.us/PA_Constitution.html">state constitution</a> [text] which requires all justices and judges of Pennsylvania to retire at the end of the calendar year in which they reach the age of 70. The plaintiffs argue that this requirement is in violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]. In the complaint, the plaintiffs explained:<blockquote>The mandatory retirement provision (i) is not rationally related to furthering a legitimate state interest, (ii) does not further an important government interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest, and/or (iii) is not narrowly tailored and/or the least restrictive means to furthering a compelling government interest. The mandatory retirement provision of the Pennsylvania Constitution discriminates against persons aged seventy and older, and thus violates Plaintiff's equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</blockquote>The complaint asks the court to find the constitutional provision unenforceable and to restore the position of Pennsylvania Senior Judge Benjamin Lerner. 

<p>The US Supreme Court has previously considered the merits of a challenge to mandatory retirement provisions of a state constitution. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=872431609081984169">Gregory v. Ashcroft</a> [opinion], Missouri state court judges challenged a mandatory retirement provision in the state constitution, but the Supreme Court held that the provision did not violate equal protection. Mandatory retirement laws have been considered in European courts of law as well. Earlier this month the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official site] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-strikes-down-hungary-law-lowering-retirement-age-for-judges.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law which would have lowered the mandatory retirement age for judges in Hungary from 70 to 62, stating the law was not proportionate to the objectives Hungary was pursing. In 2009 the ECJ ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/europe-court-rules-uk-mandatory.php">UK's mandatory retirement laws were not discriminatory</a> [JURIST report], stating age-based classifications are justifiable in some circumstances. The ECJ also ruled in 2007 that the EU's <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/eu-court-upholds-mandatory-retirement.php">mandatory retirement policies</a> [JURIST report] did not violate the prohibition against age discrimination if the policy is intended to further the legitimate public interest of increasing employment and the retirees are provided with full pensions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking before 500 high-level officials at a ceremony for the tenth anniversary of the ICC, Ban praised the court for bringing perpetrators of human rights abuses to justice. However, Ban also emphasized that for the ICC to be effective, governments need to cooperate with the court to make sure its decisions are carried out:<blockquote>As we celebrate the Court's significant accomplishments, we must also acknowledge that there are still many forces that seek to undermine the edifice we have all striven so hard to create. ... This is why it is important to ensure that governments are committed to doing what it takes to enable the Court to carry out its work&#8212;from capturing and transferring to the Court those who are the subject of arrest warrants to supporting the Court's proceedings by making information and evidence available to the Prosecutor, the Defence and the legal representatives of victims.</blockquote>The ICC is currently <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43494&Cr=criminal+court&Cr1=#.UKUD5IVxs7A">investigating conflicts in seven nations</a> [UN News Centre report]: Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, the Darfur region of western Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kenya, Libya and Uganda.

However, to the dismay of many, individuals such as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=joseph+kony">Joseph Kony</a> [JURIST news archive] of Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army and Congolese rebel leader <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-issues-new-arrest-warrant-for-congo-general.php">Bosco Ntaganda</a> [JURIST report] remain at large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontireland.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Ireland's <a href="http://www.gilmore.ie/">Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.labour.ie/press/listing/13529859693449004.html">pledged</a> [official statement] Thursday to bring "legal clarity" to Ireland's abortion laws following the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">death of Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion. Ireland, a traditionally Catholic nation, has some of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/world/europe/17ireland.html">most restrictive</a> [NYT report] abortion laws in Europe. The <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ei00000_.html">Irish Constitution</a> [text] recognizes a right to life for the unborn as fundamental from the moment of conception and only permits abortions when a pregnancy jeopardizes the mother's own right to life. The subjective nature of the standard has caused confusion for many doctors and patients, and many hospitals have adopted very conservative policies in an effort to not run afoul of the law. According to Gilmore, Ireland needs to "provide clarity for medical professionals who must make judgment calls on these matters in the real-life situation of a hospital, and must hear the concerns they have about making a decision that may expose them to action if some person disagrees with it." Ireland's <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/">Health Service Executive</a> (HSE) [official website] released a <a href="http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/News/NIMT.html">statement</a> [text] on Wednesday extending its sympathies to Halappanavar's family and confirming a review of her death by the National Incident Management Team (NIMT) was forthcoming.

<p>The death of Halappanavar is the latest controversy surrounding Ireland's abortion laws, and abortion remains a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/world/europe/hospital-death-in-ireland-renews-fight-over-abortion.html">highly divisive</a> [NYT report] issue in Ireland. On Tuesday, the Irish Department of Health received an <a href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/taoiseach-expert-group-delivered-abortion-report-last-night-574183.html">expert group report </a> [Irish Examiner report] on how Ireland should deal with its abortion laws. The report was commissioned after a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">2010 ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website], which stated that Ireland failed to provide "effective and adequate procedures" to allow women to exercise their right to a lawful abortion and that the country's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12008623">legal situation</a> [BBC backgrounder] constituted a "chilling factor" for both women and doctors. The ruling came after a woman suffered complications when she had to travel from the Irish Republic to the UK in 2005 to seek an abortion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble signed the amended agreement at a ceremony in the Jewish Museum in Berlin. The amendments were initially approved by the Finance ministry in July after concluding negotiations with the <a href="http://www.claimscon.org/index.asp">Jewish Claims Conference</a> (JCC) [official website]. The new compensation agreement expanded the number of victims eligible for compensation, offering one-time payments to some victims who were able to escape their home countries before Nazi occupation. It also expands monthly compensation for current beneficiaries of the agreement. The Finance Ministry meets with the JCC each year to discuss the Luxembourg Agreement. 

<p>Countries around the world have continued to prosecute suspected Nazis. Police in Slovakia announced in September that they had <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] of 97-year-old Laszlo Csatary, who is suspected of war crimes in connection with the Holocaust. In July Hungarian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hungary-charges-suspected-ex-nazi-with-war-crimes.php">charged Csatary</a> [JURIST report] with the "unlawful torture of human beings," a war crime that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Csatary was at the top of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's (SWC) <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7958595.stm">list of most wanted Nazi war criminals</a> [BBC backgrounder], and the SWC had already called on the Hungarian government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/hungary-urged-to-prosecute-alleged-nazi-war-criminal.php">prosecute the Nazi war criminal</a> [JURIST report] when the center issued its annual report in April. In January the Ingolstadt Prosecutor's Office <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/german-prosecutors-ex-nazi-criminal-should-serve-life-sentence.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to jail Klaas Faber, a Dutch native who fled to Germany after being convicted in the Netherlands in 1947 of Nazi war crimes. Germany <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened investigations</a> into former Nazi death camp guards in October 2011, which stemmed from the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction of John Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST reports], a former guard at a camp in Poland who was deported to Germany to stand trial for his alleged Nazi crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2012/ag-speech-121115.html">emphasized</a> [statement] that the settlement includes a roughly $1.25 billion criminal fine, and also announced that two BP supervisors aboard the Deepwater Horizon during the spill have been charged with 23 criminal counts, including manslaughter as a result of the 11 workers killed aboard the rig during the April 2010 explosion. As part of the agreement, <a href="http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=2012968&contentId=7080497">BP has agreed</a> [press release] to plead guilty to 11 of the felonies related to the workers' deaths, a charge of obstruction of Congress and two misdemeanors. The deal includes payment of about $2.4 billion to the <a href="www.nfwf.org">National Fish and Wildlife Foundation</a>, $350 million to the <a href="www.nasonline.org">National Academy of Sciences</a> and roughly $500 million to the <a href="www.sec.gov">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [official websites]. Holder went on to say that the criminal investigations of BP by the <a href="www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] are still ongoing and that the current criminal settlement, which still needs to be approved by a federal judge, does not include the damages sought by the government under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> [text, PDF], the <a href="http://www.fws.gov/laws/lawsdigest/migtrea.html">Migratory Bird Act</a> [text] and other federal laws.

<p>Last week the <a href="www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-and-gulf-oil-spill-plaintiffs-urge-federal-judge-to-approve-settlement-agreement.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding approval of a class-action settlement agreement between BP and various individuals and businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon incident. There, attorneys on both sides urged Judge Carl Barbier to approve the settlement agreement, under which BP is expected to pay approximately $7.8 billion. It has been argued that the settlement is a <a href="/hotline/2012/05/tim-mcevoy-bp-settlement.php">step in the right direction</a> [JURIST op-ed] for compensating those affected by the oil spill. In May Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/dnp-1.php">signed a case management order</a> [JURIST report] outlining the structure for the upcoming trial of Gulf oil spill claims, scheduled for January 14, 2013. The judge divided the trial into two phases. In phase one, or the "incident" phase, the court will address issues arising out of the various parties' conduct leading to the incident and appropriation of their negligence. Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-gulf-oil-spill-settlement.php">gave preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to the proposed settlement agreement earlier that month. In April BP and a group of plaintiffs' attorneys <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/bp-asks-federal-judge-to-accept-terms-of-gulf-oil-spill-settlement.php">sought Barbier's preliminary approval</a> on the settlement, which they had <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/bp-reaches-settlement-agreement-with-gulf-oil-spill-victims.php">reached</a> [JURIST reports] in March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a split 8-7 decision, the court struck down <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-138_State_Prop_11-06_174276_7.pdf">Proposal 2</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=michigan+proposal+2">news archive</a>], which banned affirmative action in public employment, public education and state contracting. The court, sitting <em>en banc</em>, reasoned that Proposal 2 made the process for college admissions unequal by preventing universities from employing race-conscious programs, thus disadvantaging minorities. Proposal 2 modified the Michigan political process by banning any legislation that would be beneficial to minorities in the application process for employment and for university admissions. As a result of this burden on minorities, the legislation was examined under a strict scrutiny standard, meaning the Attorney General had to prove that the legislation was necessary to advance a "compelling state interest." Circuit Judge R. Guy Cole, Jr. wrote the majority opinion, stating:<blockquote>In Seattle, the Court did not consider whether a compelling state interest might justify a state's enactment of a racially-focused law that restructures the political process, because the government made no such argument. ... Likewise, because the Attorney General does not assert that Proposal 2 satisfies a compelling state interest, we need not consider this argument. Therefore, those portions of Proposal 2 that affect Michigan's public institutions of higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause.</blockquote>Although Proposal 2 also addressed employment policies, the court's decision was limited to the ban on race for the purposes of public university admissions.

<p>A three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-finds-michigan-affirmative-action-ban-unconstitutional.php">found the proposal unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] in July 2011. The panel ruled that the proposal unduly burdened minorities by abusing a political process where minorities were likely to have no redress. The ruling reversed a 2008 decision by the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/michigan-affirmative-action-ban-ruled.php">dismiss the challenge</a> [JURIST report] with prejudice. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/michigan-ag-appeals-decision-overturning-affirmative-action-ban.php">made a formal request for a rehearing</a> [JURIST report] in July 2011 stating that the Sixth Circuit's decision conflicted with prior decisions of the court. In September 2011 the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-to-conduct-rehearing-on-michigan-affirmative-action-ban.php">agreed to a rehearing <em>en banc</em></a> to determine the constitutionality of Proposal 2, which was <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/michigan-voters-approve-affirmative.php">approved by voters</a> [JURIST reports] in 2006. The US Supreme Court heard arguments last month in in <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-on-affirmative-action-challenge.php">Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin</a> [JURIST report], in which the plaintiff is challenging the constitutionality of that university's affirmative action program. A ruling is expected by June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Richard Gergel ruled that he would still <a href="http://www.live5news.com/story/20108449/federal-judge">prevent</a> [AP report] certain parts of the immigration law from taking effect. Gergel heard <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-hears-arguments-on-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] Tuesday on the part of South Carolina's controversial immigration law that permits law enforcement officials to detain motorists on the side of the road for a "reasonable amount of time" while the officer checks the driver's immigration status. During arguments, Gergel asserted that 90 minutes is too long to detain a vehicle, but that 38 minutes could be considered reasonable and may not violate the constitutional protections against unlawful searches and seizures conferred by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text].

The lawsuit against the South Carolina immigration law was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-judge-halts-south-carolina-immigration-lawsuit.php">put on hold</a> [JURIST report] in January pending the outcome of Arizona v.

Magistrate Judge Paul Grewal <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-11-15/apple-samsung-allowed-to-add-products-to-patent-lawsuit">allowed Apple to add claims</a> [Bloomberg report] that several of its patents are violated by a number of Samsung products, including the Galaxy SIII, Galaxy Note and the Jelly Bean operating system. Grewal also allowed Samsung to pursue claims that its patents are infringed by Apple's iPhone 5. Originally filed by Apple, the lawsuit alleges that the various Samsung smart phones and tablets infringe eight of Apple's patents, and in response Samsung has filed cross-compalints alleging that Apple's iPhone and iPad infringe eight of its patents. The lawsuit is one of two pending <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/lhk/applevsamsung">patent infringement cases</a> [materials] between the two companies, and is currently scheduled for trial in 2014.

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. In October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. In the same time frame Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed</a> a Tokyo District Court ruling [JURIST report] which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of October, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product. Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The five-judge appeals chamber <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/11145">ordered the immediate release</a> [press release] of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13035992">Ante Gotovina</a> [BBC profile] and Mladen Markac, who were <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/gotovina/tjug/en/110415_summary.pdf">found guilty</a> [judgment, PDF] in 2011 of crimes that included murder and illegally expelling Serb citizens as part of a criminal conspiracy. The appellate judges found that the trial chamber erred in multiple findings, most notably that prosecutors did not prove the existence of a criminal conspiracy, clearing Croatia's wartime leadership of war crimes in the 1990s operation known as Operation Storm. The 3-2 decision is one of the most significant reversals in The Hague-based court's 18-year history. Croatian prime minister <a href="http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/clanovi_vlade/zoran_milanovic">Zoran Milanovic </a> [official profile] said the ruling was "an important moment for Croatia" and proves that Operation Storm was a just war rather than an ethnic cleansing of Serbs.

<p>Gotovina and Markac were originally found guilty of charges including murder, plunder, persecution and deportation in 2011, and were sentenced to 24 and 18 years respectively. The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/former-croatian-generals-on-trial-at.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of Gotovina and Markac, along with Croatian militant commander Ivan Cermak, in 2008. Gotovina was indicted in 2001 and was the third most-wanted ICTY war crimes suspect until his <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/croatian-war-crimes-suspect-arrested.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 in Spain's Canary Islands. Established as an ad hoc tribunal, the ICTY was the first war crimes court created by the UN, and it opened its <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icty-opens-final-war-crimes-trial.php">final trial</a> [JURIST report] last month. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/gayle-v-napolitano-complaint">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/immigrants-rights/aclu-files-class-action-lawsuit-challenging-mandatory-immigration-lock">press release</a>] Thursday on behalf of New Jersey immigrants challenging mandatory detention procedures. The policy in question is <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1226">8 USC &#167; 1226(c)</a> [text], which mandates the detention of noncitizens during deportation proceedings, and such noncitizens are not entitled to a bond hearing, even if they pose no danger or flight risk. In its complaint, the ACLU claims that many of the individuals detained under the law ultimately do not qualify for deportation, and argues that the mandatory detention in unconstitutional. The complaint demands:<blockquote>In light of the significant constitutional issues presented by such detention, 8 USC &#167; 1226(c) should be read not to authorize the mandatory detention of individuals who have a substantial challenge to deportability or inadmissibility. It should also be read to require the opportunity for a constitutionally adequate hearing to determine whether an individual is properly subject to mandatory detention. This hearing should include adequate notice; require that the government bear the burden of establishing prima facie deportability or inadmissibility on a ground that triggers mandatory detention; provide the detainee the opportunity to demonstrate that he has a substantial challenge to deportability or inadmissibility on those grounds; and require that a contemporaneous record of proceedings be made and maintained so that the determination is amenable to meaningful review.</blockquote>Although the Supreme Court in 2003 determined mandatory detentions to be constitutional in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6530717710454372385">Demore v. Kim</a> [opinion], the ACLU has said that the situation in the case at hand is sufficiently distinct to merit the court's consideration.

<p>In recent years, the US has had great difficulty with its attempts to manage its immigration policies. Earlier this year the ACLU called out immigrant detention centers in <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/aclu-calls-for-immediate-remedy-of-arizona-immigrant-detention-conditions.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/aclu-criticizes-georgia-immigration-detention-centers.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports] for being unsanitary, failing to give inmates proper access to medical treatment and even denying inmates due process. Last year the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/third-circuit-rules-prolonged-detention-of-immigrants-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that imprisoned immigrants who are fighting deportation cannot be held indefinitely without a bail hearing and that the government must justify the need for the prolonged detention. In an effort to combat illegal immigration, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/ice-launches-voluntary-deportation.php">launched a voluntary deportation program</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 which would allow certain illegal immigrants to coordinate their removal from the US with ICE without the risk of home raids, arrest or detention. However, the program was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-immigration-authority-abandons.php">abandoned</a> [JURIST report] for its lack of success three weeks later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay expressed extreme concern over the continued use of indiscriminate Palestinian rocket fire taking place over the past week and the resulting increased aerial attacks by Israeli forces on populated areas of the Gaza strip. Pillay's statement echoed that of <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website], who on Monday <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=6412">called for an immediate cessation</a> [press release] of indiscriminate rocket attacks by Palestinian militants. The violence began to escalate on Wednesday with the killing of Hamas military chief <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/ahmed-jabari-hamas_n_2131265.html">Ahmed Jabari</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> backgrounder] in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/15/world/middleeast/israeli-strike-in-gaza-kills-the-military-leader-of-hamas.html?pagewanted=all">targeted air strike</a> [NYT report] by Israel Defense Forces. The next day Palestinian forces <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/15/us-palestinians-israel-hamas-idUSBRE8AD0WP20121115">responded with rocket fire</a> [Reuters report] aimed at multiple Israeli cities and towns. Pillay's statement urged a deescalation of hostilities and lamented the the loss of human life on each side of the violence. Both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority are <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&id=375&ps=P">signing members</a> [materials] of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/380">Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949</a> [text] committing to the protection of civilians in times of military conflict.

<p>Earlier this week Pillay visited Indonesia where she urged the government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-indonesia-to-end-discrimination.php">end violence and discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against Christians and Muslim minorities. Pillay commended Indonesia for ratifying several international human rights treaties and for progressing in its democratic transition but stressed the need to end targeted discrimination in the country. Last week Pillay urged South Sudan to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-south-sudan-to-reverse-expulsion-of-human-rights-officer.php">reverse an expulsion order</a> [JURIST report] against a <a href="http://unmiss.unmissions.org/">UN Mission in South Sudan</a> (UNMISS) [official website] staff member, claiming the government has given no good reason to support the order. Earlier in November Pillay expressed concern that the Chinese government is <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-china-to-address-human-rights-situation-in-tibet.php">suppressing Tibetans' freedom of expression</a> [JURIST report] and that the government is using excessive force against peaceful protestors, with Pillay calling on China to remedy long-held frustrations in Tibet that have led to recent extreme protest tactics, and urging Tibetans to not resort to self-immolation or other extreme protest measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the use of cannabis is legal in Uruguay, the growth and sale of the drug is not. The <a href="http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/236980/ley-de-marihuana-preve-multas-de-hasta--1200000-por-incumplirla/">bill proposed</a> [<em>El Observador</em> report, in Spanish] the creation of a National Cannabis Institute which would have the power to license individuals or companies for the production, storage, and distribution of marijuana. The National Cannabis Institute would also be responsible for imposing sanctions on rule-breakers and for creating policies to educate citizens on the risk of marijuana consumption. The state would have control over the management and regulation of the trade, with plans to track consumption through a confidential database. According to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/uruguay-lawmakers-consider-creating-cannabis-institute-with-goal-of-outselling-pot-dealers/2012/11/15/548724ac-2f68-11e2-af17-67abba0676e2_story.html">guidelines of the bill</a> [AP report], consumers would be able to purchase up to 40 grams of marijuana each month. The passing of this bill would make Uruguay legislation among the most permissive on drugs. A more restrictive marijuana bill was introduced in August, proposing that the production and sale of marijuana would be <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/uruguay-presents-bill-to-legalize-production-and-sale-of-marijuana.php">solely the responsibility of the government</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Marijuana use has created legal controversy around the world, especially in the US. In November, US voters passed ballot initiatives to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalize marijuana</a> [JURIST report] for the first time on a statewide basis in both Colorado and Washington. In June the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/about/council.html">Chicago City Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/chicago-votes-to-decriminalize-marijuana.php">voted to decriminalize</a> [JURIST report] the possession of small amounts of marijuana, detailing that police officers may issue tickets to individuals found to be in possession of 10 grams of marijuana or less. In May the Connecticut Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/connecticut-senate-approves-new-medicinal-marijuana-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing citizens to obtain marijuana for medical use under certain conditions, making Connecticut the seventeenth state to allow sale of marijuana for medical use. Other states that have passed similar laws have run into trouble with conflicting federal laws regulating the production and sale of marijuana. In March the <a href="http://www.caed.uscourts.gov/caednew/">US District Court for the Eastern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-rules-california-medical-marijuana-providers-not-shielded-from-federal-prosecution.php">dismissed a suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging US Attorneys' authority to prosecute medical marijuana providers in California. In January the <a href="http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Montana</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-court-rules-montana-medical-marijuana-law-does-not-shield-providers-from-federal-prosecution.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's laws allowing the sale of medical marijuana did not protect dispensers from federal prosecution. Connecticut has nevertheless been taking steps toward legalization of marijuana, last year passing a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/connecticut-senate-approves-marijuana-decriminalization-bill.php">decriminalizing possession </a>[JURIST report] of small amounts of marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/google-to-pay-ftc-million-fine-for-misrepresenting-privacy-protections.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month to <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/08/google.shtm">pay a record fine</a> [press release] of $22.5 million to the FTC. The settlement also required Google to disable the tracking "cookies" that it originally said would not be placed on buyers' computers. <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/">Consumer Watchdog</a> [advocacy website], a consumer advocacy nonprofit, <a href="http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/resources/consumerwatchdogftcgoog092112.pdf">opposed the settlement in court</a> [memorandum, PDF], requesting that the court reject the settlement because it failed to include a permanent injunction on Google's actions, failed to include a sufficient legal penalty, and wrongly included a denial of liability. The request for a review of the settlement was <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2012cv04177/257903/24/0.pdf?1350553141">granted</a> [order, PDF] on October 12. The judge <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/nov/16/judge-approves-ftcs-225m-fine-of-google/">approved the settlement</a> [AP report] hours after the final arguments concerning the validity of the settlement.

<p>This is one of many legal challenges Google has faced regarding the privacy of internet users. In February, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a suit filed by the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website], a consumer privacy group, that asked the FTC to block Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">proposed privacy changes</a> [text] that would allow a user's information to be shared among several Google products, including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps. Also in February, members of the <a href="http://markey.house.gov/issues/bipartisan-congressional-privacy-caucus-0">Congressional Bi-Partisan Privacy Caucus</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-congressmen-petition-ftc-to-investigate-google-privacy-practices.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to the FTC asking it to look into Google's possible unlawful privacy practices related to bypassing Safari settings to track users browser histories without their consent. The settlement allegedly violated by Google in this case was arranged in October 2011, and barred Google from misrepresenting the extent to which consumers can exercise control over the collection of their information. Several months prior, in March, the FTC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a similar settlement regarding Google's breach of consumer privacy rights by misleading users with Google Buzz, the company's then-social networking site. Previous concerns were raised in April 2007 when several internet privacy groups <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/privacy-groups-file-ftc-complaint-over.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the FTC to investigate the merger between Google and the advertising provider <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/">DoubleClick</a> [corporate website]. "Deceptive" and "unfair" advertising claims were also <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/consumer-groups-file-ftc-complaint.php">brought against Google</a> [JURIST report] by consumer groups in November 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

ASEAN will consider the declaration at its summit in Phnom Penh in Cambodia on Sunday, where it is expected that the document <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/11/17/despite-criticism-asean-set-adopt-rights-declaration.html">will be adopted</a> [Jakarta Post report]. The UN experts and others have expressed reservations that the declaration as drafted <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43520&Cr=human+rights&Cr1=#.UKfiNuOe_mo">lacks protection for fundamental human rights</a> [UN News Centre report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/human-rights-organizations-criticize-asean-proposed-rights-protections.php">report</a>] and that it leaves many provisions contingent upon domestic laws of its member nations. In an <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/SP/LetterASEAN_Nov2012.doc">open letter</a> [text, PDF] to ASEAN members states the UN experts noted that adoption of a human rights declaration would be a "significant step" for the organization, but it is "imperative" that when this happens the declaration be credible and in line with international standards. Director General for ASEAN Cooperation at the Foreign Ministry I Gusti Agung Wesaka Puja defended the declaration as a starting place to strengthen human rights protections, and noting that it is not an easy to garner consensus from all 10 member nations on such an issue.

<p>ASEAN has long worked to reform countries in Southeast Asia, a region that is often criticized for many types of human rights violations. In April ASEAN agreed at its annual summit to strive to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/asean-agrees-to-extend-human-rights-protections.php">strengthen human rights protections</a> [JURIST reoprt] for its <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/asean-member-states">member states</a> [ASEAN info page]. In 2009 it <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/asean-leaders-establish-human-rights.php">established</a> [JURIST report] its first human rights commission, the Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, to offer human rights education and device for government agencies, develop regional norms, collect information from member states and perform other tasks to promote adoption of higher human rights standards in its member nations. The commission was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/asean-ministers-discuss-rights-body.php">created during Thailand's chairmanship</a> [JURIST report] of ASEAN that year and determination of the commission's potential powers caused controversy within the organization.

Based on satellite imagery of Muslim communities in Myanmar's Arakan State, HRW claimed that in some cases, Myanmar soldiers destroyed Rohingya homes and committed violence against civilians. In the press release, HRW Asia Director <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/brad-adams">Brad Adams</a> [official profile] chastised Myanmar's government for claiming to respect human rights while simultaneously condoning ethnic and religious violence: <blockquote>The satellite images and eyewitness accounts reveal that local mobs at times with official support sought to finish the job of removing Rohingya from these areas. The central government's failure to take serious action to ensure accountability for the...violence fostered impunity, and makes it responsible for later attacks not only when security forces were directly involved but also when they weren&#8217;t.</blockquote>US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] is scheduled to visit Myanmar on Monday. HRW has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/rights-group-myanmar-forces-supported-attacks-17750795#.UKj5HIVxs7A">urged Obama</a> [AP report] to threaten sanctions against Myanmar unless the government stops its attacks on Rohingya. 

<p>Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently. Earlier this week Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/myanmar-frees-452-prisoners-ahead-of-obama-visit.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would free 452 prisoners ahead of Obama's visit. However, human rights groups <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/myanmar-announces-release-of-452-prisoners/article/feed/2048399#.UKT6woVxs7A">expressed disappointment</a> [AP report] that the government has not freed any of the estimated 330 political prisoners in Myanmar. Last month HRW urged Myanmar's government to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-groups-call-for-end-to-myanmar-sectarian-violence.php">end sectarian violence</a> [JURIST report] between the Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims. In August Physicians for Human Rights reported that Myanmar's army is <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-burma-continues-human-rights-abuses-against-karen-ethnic-minorities.php">still committing human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] against ethnic minorities in Karen state. Earlier that month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-myanmar-forces-committed-human-rights-violations-following-mob-violence.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Myanmar security forces of human rights abuses against a minority religious community. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-myanmar-ethnic-clashes.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about both the continued violence in Myanmar and the country's human rights abuses committed in dealing with it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmarijuana.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Several members of the <a href="http://house.gov">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://polis.house.gov/uploadedfiles/11-16_polis_ltr_to_doj_dea.pdf">sent a letter</a> [text, PDF] to the US <a href="http://justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) on Friday urging the federal government to respect recently passed state legislation on marijuana use. The representatives asked the DOJ and its subdivision, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/index.shtml">Drug Enforcement Agency</a> (DEA) [official websites] to refrain from prosecuting individuals and businesses in Colorado and Washington for using small amounts of marijuana after both states <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">legalized marijuana two weeks ago</a> [JURIST report]. The letter, signed by seventeen members of Congress, urges Attorney General <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Eric Holder</a> and DEA Administrator <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/about/leadership.shtml">Michele M. Leonhart</a> [official profiles] to recognize that voters in Washington and Colorado clearly indicated that they want marijuana decriminalized and that the federal government should not infringe upon the will of voters. The letter contends that Washington and Colorado's newly passed laws not only promote sound public policy, but also comport with the goals of federal drug laws: <blockquote>[Washington and Colorado] have chosen to move from a drug policy that spends millions of dollars turning ordinary Americans into criminals toward one that will tightly regulate the use of marijuana while raising tax revenue to support cash-strapped state and local governments. We believe this approach embraces the goals of existing federal marijuana law: to stop international trafficking, deter domestic organized criminal organizations, stop violence associated with the drug trade and protect children.</blockquote>It is unclear to what extent the DOJ and DEA will enforce federal marijuana laws against individuals in states that have approved the use of marijuana. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] was a hot-button issue in several states in the November 6 election. In Washington voters <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">approved an initiative</a> [Initiative 502, PDF] to allow the possession and distribution of marijuana through a state-licensing system of marijuana growers, processors and stores, where adults can buy up to an ounce. The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado initiative</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] actually introduces an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and to privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In Oregon the <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">Cannabis Tax Act Initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] failed by <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [Examiner.com report] of the vote. Medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts for the first time as over 60 percent of voters approved <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">Question 3</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF], an indirect initiated statute that will <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">allow marijuana use by patients</a> [Harvard Crimson report] with "debilitating medical conditions" and create 35 medical marijuana dispensaries. Conversely, the <a href="http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/Documents/2012%20Proposed%20Initiatives%20and%20Referenda/Marijuana%20Proposal%20Text%20for%20web.pdf">Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act</a> [Issue 5, PDF] was <a href="http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/232534/2/ISSUE-5-Medical-marijuana-measure-rejected">rejected by voters</a> [AP report] in that state by approximately a 52-to-48 percent margin. The measure would have allowed doctors to issue a certificate to anyone with a "qualifying medical condition" to grow, process and use marijuana. Also on the ballot in Montana is a veto referendum regarding a <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/2011/billhtml/SB0423.htm">2011 revision</a> [SB 423] of a 2004 law that established medical marijuana use in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This came after the most recent attack by the group in the eastern region of the DRC as they advance to Goma. The Security Council called for an end to all support for the rebel group and for M23 to end their attacks. In addition, the Security Council also demanded the M23 allow humanitarian aid to those displaced by the violence. There have been 4,000 more internally displaced persons <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43526&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo#.UKkqrOOe8wQ">since the outbreak of the current fighting</a> [UN News report]. This adds to the existing 80,000 already displaced in the region.

<p>The violence and unrest in the eastern part of the DRC has been a focus of the international community. Earlier this week, a UN rights body <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-investigation-in-drc-reveals-mass-execution-of-civilians.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] that confirmed the arbitrary executions of at least 264 civilians. Last month Ugandan officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uganda-official-denies-support-of-congo-rebels.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] UN Security Council allegations that Uganda had helped assisting M23 rebels with troops and supplies in the DRC. Similarly in August, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court (ICC)</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-urged-to-investigate-rwanda-president-for-arming-drc-rebels.php">received requests</a> [JURIST report] to investigate Rwandan President <a href="http://www.presidency.gov.rw/presidents-profile">Paul Kagame</a> [official profile] for allegedly backing armed rebels in the DRC. In the same month, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/security-council-reaffirms-condemnation-of-democratic-republic-of-congo-renegade-soldiers.php">reiterated their condemnation</a> [JURIST report] of M23, demanding foreign entities cease aid to the rebel group.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The agreement has been <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43520&Cr=human+rights&Cr1=#.UKk7KuOe8wR">widely criticized</a> [UN News report] by human rights groups who expressed concern that the agreement allows for violations and does not do enough to protect fundamental rights. Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/321909/asean-inks-contentious-human-rights-pact">praised</a> [Bankok Post report] the resolution as an important step in the human rights process. Director General for ASEAN Cooperation at the Foreign Ministry I Gusti Agung Wesaka Puja also defended the declaration as a starting place to strengthen human rights protections, noting that it was not easy to garner a consensus from all 10 member nations on such an issue.

<p>ASEAN has long worked to reform countries in Southeast Asia, a region that is often criticized for human rights violations. UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-expresses-concern-as-asean-considers-its-first-human-rights-declaration.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] with the human rights agreement earlier this week. In April ASEAN agreed at its annual summit to strive to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/asean-agrees-to-extend-human-rights-protections.php">strengthen human rights protections</a> [JURIST reoprt] for its <a href="http://www.asean.org/asean/asean-member-states">member states</a> [ASEAN info page]. In 2009 it <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/asean-leaders-establish-human-rights.php">established</a> [JURIST report] its first human rights commission, the Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights, to offer human rights education and device for government agencies, develop regional norms, collect information from member states and perform other tasks to promote adoption of higher human rights standards in its member nations. The commission was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/asean-ministers-discuss-rights-body.php">created during Thailand's chairmanship</a> [JURIST report] of ASEAN that year and determination of the commission's potential powers caused controversy within the organization. <br />

Alabama</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-rules-mandatory-life-sentences-for-juveniles-unconstitutional.php">report</a>], which held that sentencing minors to life without parole constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text], will not apply retroactively. The appeals court ruled that the Supreme Court decision "is not to be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review ... because the decision is procedural and not substantive in nature." The court also urged Michigan's legislature to bring the state's laws into compliance with the <span class="casename">Miller</span> ruling, noting that in <span class="casename">Miller</span>, a juvenile is defined as under the age of 18, but in Michigan a juvenile is defined as under the age of 17. Michigan is <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121117/METRO/211170352">among the top states</a> [AP report] for sentencing of minors to life without the possibility of parole, with more than 350 people currently serving life sentences without the possibility for parole for crimes committed in their youth. 

<p>In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] wrote a letter to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/rights-group-asks-pennsylvania-governor-to-veto-juvenile-life-sentence-bill.php">asking him to veto</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0850&pn=2475">legislation</a> [SB 850 text] which would maintain the sentence of life without parole as an option for child offenders. According to HRW, the bill would go against the spirit of the recent US Supreme Court ruling in <span class="casename">Miller</span>. In June the US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in two combined cases, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/miller-v-alabama/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Miller v. Alabama</a> and <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/jackson-v-hobbs/">Jackson v. Hobbs</a> [SCOTUS backgrounders] that mandatory life sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment. The decision has been seen by many as an important <a href="/forum/2012/09/perry-moriearty-juvenile-justice.php">step toward restoring principles of rehabilitationism</a> [JURIST op-ed] to a system that, over the last 20 years, has come almost entirely unmoored from its ideological foundations. Some observers have argued that the reasoning the court used in this case <a href="/dateline/2012/06/elizabeth-imbarlina-juvenile-parole.php">could easily be extended</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the future to abolish life in prison without the possibility of parole sentences for all juvenile homicide cases. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Li Bifing was <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1086118/china-court-gives-dissident-li-bifeng-12-year-sentence">sentenced</a> [AFP report] by the Shehong County Court in China's Sichuan province, according to a lawyer. Li <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/19/chinese-poet-li-bifeng-jailed">previously served five years in jail</a> [AP report] for his involvement in the 1989 protests on Tiananmen Square. Li was detained two months after his friend Liao Yiwu <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/29/writer-fled-china-friend-detained?INTCMP=SRCH">escaped from China</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in June and fled to Germany. Li was also sentenced to jail time in 1998 due to alleged fraud related to the sale of a safe-box from his workplace. This prison sentence arose after Li investigated a strike by textile workers and wrote an open letter to authorities about his findings. Li's lawyer Ma Xiaopeng said that Monday's court hearing was flawed. 

<p>Dissidents and human rights advocates have encountered significant legal problems in China. In September Beijing's Second Intermediate People's Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/china-court-rejects-dissident-artists-tax-evasion-appeal.php">denied an appeal</a> [JURIST report] by dissident artist Ai Weiwei challenging a 15 million yuan (USD $2.4 million) fine for back taxes. The Chinese government levied the fine against Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd., the company that promotes Ai's work. In June a Chinese intermediate court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/china-court-dismisses-fraud-charges-against-human-rights-lawyer.php">dismissed fraud charges</a> [JURIST report] against Ni Yulan, a human rights lawyer with disabilities, resulting in a two-month reduction to her two-year and eight-month sentence while upholding convictions against the lawyer for causing a disturbance. Ni had assisted victims of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/29/chinese-rights-activist-fraud-trial?newsfeed=true">government land seizures</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], including those displaced by the Beijing Olympics project, prior to their arrest in August 2011. The fraud charges included allegations that Ni received 5,000 yuan (USD $783) through fabrication of her identity as a lawyer. Ni and her husband, Dong Jiqin, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/china-activist-sentenced-to-prison-for-inciting-disturbance-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in April by a lower court on charges of fraud and inciting disturbance. The sentence faced criticism by human rights organizations such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], which for their immediate release. Also in June a Chinese court in the southwestern city of Chongqing <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/china-court-rules-detention-of-blogger-was-illegal.php">quashed</a> [JURIST report] the sentence against a Chinese blogger and former forestry employee for lack of evidence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint avers that eBay violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-1">Sherman Act</a> [15 USC &#167; 1 text; Cornell <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sherman_antitrust_act">backgrounder</a>], by entering into a no-solicitation and no-hiring agreement with business software producer <a href="http://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a> [corporate website] pursuant to which the companies agreed not to hire or recruit each other's employees. In particular, the DOJ challenges the legality of provisions that expressly prohibited eBay from hiring Intuit employees, even upon their affirmative inquiry to eBay for employment. The DOJ <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/November/12-at-1376.html">stated</a> [press release] that the these provisions "eliminated a significant form of competition to the detriment of affected employees who were likely deprived of access to better job opportunities and salaries." The complaint elaborates:<blockquote>Firms in the same or similar industries often compete to hire or retain talented employees. This is particularly true in technology companies in which particular expertise and highly specialized skills sought by one firm can often be found at another firm. Solicitation of skilled employees at other companies is an effective method of competing for needed employees ... eBay's agreement with Intuit eliminated this competition.</blockquote>According to the DOJ, former eBay Chief Executive Officer, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/meg-whitman/">Meg Whitman</a> and Intuit founder and Chairman of the Executive Committee, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/scott-cook/">Scott Cook</a> [Forbes profiles], were "intimately involved" in the formation and enforcement of the "handshake" agreement, which the DOJ characterized as an unlawful, "naked restraint of trade." The <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/">California Department of Justice</a> [official website], headed by <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/about">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official profile], worked closely with the US DOJ and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-files-lawsuit-against-ebay-anticompetitive">filed a similar suit</a> [press release] concurrently. 

<p>The DOJ has recently been involved in other lawsuits involving alleged violations of the Sherman Act. In early September a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/court-approves-settlement-in-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a settlement agreement between the DOJ and e-book publishers, including <a href="http://www.apple.com/startpage/">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/">Hachette</a>, <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/">HarperCollins</a>, <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/">MacMillan</a>, <a href="http://www.us.penguingroup.com/">Penguin</a> and <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/">Simon &#38; Schuster</a> [corporate websites] for alleged price-fixing violations under the Sherman Act. eBay has also been involved in litigation over trademark infringement in recent years as well. In July 2011 the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/">EU Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/eu-court-of-justice-rules-ebay-may-be-liable-for-user-infringement.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that eBay may be liable on the part its users for infringing cosmetic producer L'Oreal's trademarks. In July 2010 Connecticut company XPRT Ventures LLC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ebay-sued-for-38-billion-in-patent-infringement-case.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against eBay in the <a href="http://www.ded.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Delaware</a> [official website], claiming infringement of six patents for online auctions and payment systems.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report details the alleged abuses including arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions, extortion and torture. The military crackdown was in response to a series of coordinated attacks on military installations in August, allegedly committed by militants loyal to former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile]. HRW compiled its findings during a three-week mission to Abidjan beginning in late August after the military response was initiated. While HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/111517">says</a> [press release] that Ivorian authorities have the responsibility and right to respond to security threats, the Ivorian authorities have largely given that power to the country's military, the Republican Forces, which has no legal basis for arresting, interrogating and detaining suspects. In its official response to HRW, the Ivorian government stressed the the threat to the country and the need to support the military against the threat. However, authorities did promise an investigation into the report's allegations and said that prosecutions would result if anyone was suspected of human rights violations. HRW contends that the Republican Forces remain largely above the law that prosecuting those involved is an essential step toward returning to the rule of law and promoting reconciliation.

<p>Violence in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST news archive] has been continuous since the 2010 presidential election. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-finds-ivory-coast-ex-president-fit-to-stand-trial-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">found</a> Gbagbo fit to stand trial, which had been <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">posponed</a> [JURIST reports] since June. Gbagbo is charged with crimes against humanity on four counts including murder, persecution, inhumane acts, rape and other sexual assaults allegedly committed during the 2010 post-election violence. Through June 2012, violence <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ivory-coast-cross-border-violence-still-continues-hrw.php">continued</a> [JURIST report] from Gbagbo supporters along the Liberian-Ivorian border, killing at least 50 civilians. In February HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ivory-coast-post-election-violence-investigation-flawed-hrw.php">expressed concern</a> over the thoroughness of the investigation into the post-election violence, while in December 2010 the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-urges-calm-following-ivory-coast-election.php">urged</a> [JURIST reports] those in the Ivory Coast to refrain from further violence, which has yet to seize.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The decision by the Minister for Justice came after a 13-month review of the case.

The court <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/124/17162.pdf">decided unanimously</a> [press release, PDF] that Colombia has sovereignty "over the islands at Alburquerque, Bajo Nuevo, East-Southeast Cays, Quitasueno, Roncador, Serrana and Serranilla," finding that "the evidence of Colombia's acts of administration with respect to the islands" provides "very strong support for Colombia's claim of sovereignty." In regards to maritime control, the court recognized that the boundary lines they appropriated have the "effect of dividing the relevant area between the Parties ... in Nicaragua's favour." However, they found that the results were not so disproportionate "as to create an inequitable result."

<p>Nicaragua originally brought legal action against Colombia in December 2001, claiming that Colombia had no legal control of the islands. Public hearings were finally held between April and May of this year. A portion of Nicaragua's argument was rejected in 2007, when the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/icj-upholds-1928-nicaragua-columbia.php">upheld a 1928 treaty between Nicaragua and Colombia</a> [JURIST report] establishing that Colombia owned the islands of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/19/us-myanmar-prisoners-idUSBRE8AI05520121119">66 prisoners were to be freed</a> [Reuters report] in conjunction with the first trip to the country made by any sitting US president. While two-thirds of the prisoners were merely political dissidents, the remaining third was supposedly composed of former military intelligence personnel.

<p>Concern over Myanmar's human rights record has been growing recently.

There, a judge found that Kozlov had instigated a series of <a href="www.azattyq.org/content/kazakhstan_zhanaozen_unrest/24423801.html">violent clashes between police and striking oil workers</a> [RFE/RL report, in Kazakh] that left 15 people dead last December. In particular, the court found that the political activist had turned a labor dispute into a politicized strike on orders from billionaire Mukhtar Ablyazov, a rival of Kazakhstan <a href="www.akorda.kz">President Nursultan Nazarbayev</a> [official website, in Russian]. Despite his conviction and its <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i8z6RFkJkZZHc7vnorQ1AdbWAJWA?docId=3acb241116824444969bc31657d003df">affirmation</a> [AP report] by the courts, Kozlov has consistently denied the charges and proclaimed that his case was an attempt by the President to quell civil protests within the country.

<p>Kazakhstan has recently drawn criticism from the international community for its human rights record. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] claimed that oil workers in the country <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/hrw-kazakhstan-oil-workers-subject-to-mistreatment-repressive-laws.php">face mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] and repression at the hands of the government and oil companies. In August HRW urged Kazakhstan to ensure that the trials of Kozlov, another political activist, and an oil worker <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">comport with international legal standards</a> [JURIST report] for fair trials. In July UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-rights-chief-urges-kazakhstan-to-allow-independent-probe-into-december-unrest.php">called for an independent probe</a> [JURIST report] into the December unrest between oil workers and an oil company. In June HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-demands-kazakhstan-justify-charges-against-political-activists.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan publicly disclose the reason for bringing new charges against a group of labor activists and an oil worker who participated in the December unrest. The committee charged them with "calling for the forcible overthrow of the constitutional order." Earlier that month a court in Kazakhstan <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/hrw-kazakhstan-must-ensure-fair-trials-for-political-activists.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 13 out of 37 defendants to between three and seven years of imprisonment for their participation in unrest that occurred last December.

Karzai's statement urged Afghan officials to make efforts towards toward obtaining entire responsibility for <a href=" http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil">Bagram Prison</a> [official website]. Listed abuses included Afghan detainees held by US forces despite Afghan rulings to the contrary and the continued arrest of Afghans by US forces. The statement comes less than a week after negotiations began on a bilateral security agreement that will govern US military presence in the country after the majority of US troops withdraw from Afghanistan after 2014. The US has delayed the handover of detention facilities to Afghanistan citing both lack of preparation by Afghan leaders in detention center management and discrepancies over treatment of detainees the US deems too dangerous to release. Both countries agreed to sign the bilateral security agreement within a year.  

<p>The rights of Afghan detainees at Bagram has been a controversial issue as of late. JURIST Guest Columnist Ken Roach recently discussed the issue of prisoners <a href="/forum/2012/11/kent-roach-rahmatullah-detention.php"> seeking substitute justice</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the courts of other democracies. In September the US <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-transfers-control-of-bagram-prison-and-a-third-of-prisoners-to-afghanistan.php/">handed over Bagram</a> [JURIST report] to Afghanistan but retained control over 600 prisoners. In February 2011 District Judge John Bates of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-grants-motion-for-Bagram-detainees-to-amend-habeas-petitions.php/">granted a motion to amend</a> [JURIST report] petitions for writs of <em>habeas corpus</em> for four detainees held at Bagram. In May 2010 a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that detainees held at Bagram <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/federal-judge-lets-afghanistan.php">could not bring <em>habeas corpus</em> challenges in US courts</a> [JURIST report]. In January 2010 the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-releases-names-of-bagram-detainees.php/">released a list of names</a> [JURIST report] of 645 prisoners then detained at Bagram in response to a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/aclu-lawsuit-demands-information-on.php/">filed</a> [JURIST reports] by the ACLU in September 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Addressing the UN Security Council, Eliasson noted three areas of concern that warrant immediate action: 1) better coordination, information-sharing and trust-building among countries and agencies involved in counter-piracy operations; 2) stronger capacity to prosecute piracy cases and imprison those convicted in accordance with international human rights standards; and 3) the establishment of a framework governing the use of privately contracted armed security personnel on board vessels. According to the <a href="http://www.imo.org/Pages/home.aspx">International Maritime Organization</a> [official website], there were 291 attacks against ships in the first 10 months of 2012, and pirates are still holding 293 seafarers hostage. This marks the first time the UN Security Council has debated the issue of maritime piracy.

<p>Last month the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court of Hamburg <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/germany-court-convicts-10-somali-pirates.php">issued sentences</a> [JURIST report] for 10 Somalis who were involved in the hijacking the German freighter MS Taipan off the coast of Somalia two years ago. Also in October an appeals court in Kenya concluded that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kenya-appeals-court-allows-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">Kenyan courts have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to try international piracy suspects. In July the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/icc/imb">International Maritime Bureau</a> (IMB) [official website] reported that the number of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/international-maritime-bureau-reports-global-piracy-down-by-half-in-2012.php">global pirate attacks fell sharply</a> [JURIST report] in the first half of 2012, the <a href="http://icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre">IMB Piracy Reporting Centre</a> [official website] having received <a href="http://icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report">reports</a> [materials] of 177 incidents in the first six months of this year, compared to 266 incidents for the same period in 2011. In May a United Arab Emirates court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/somali-pirates-sentenced-to-life-in-uae.php">sentenced 10 Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report] to 25 years in prison. Also that month six <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/accused-somali-pirates-face-trial-in-paris-court-for-hostage-incident.php">accused Somali pirates went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in a Paris court in connection with the 2008 hijacking of the cruise ship Le Ponant in the Gulf of Aden.The US government in March <a href="jurist.org/paperchase/2012/03/us-hands-suspected-somali-pirates-over-to-seychelles-for-prosecution.php">handed over</a> [JURIST report] 15 suspected Somali pirates it captured in January to the Republic of Seychelles for prosecution. Last year the UN Security Council adopted a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-security-council-resolution-urges-stricter-anti-piracy-measures.php">resolution</a> encouraging states to criminalize and punish piracy after maritime piracy hit an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/maritime-piracy-at-all-time-high-somalia-waters-driving-explosion.php">all time high</a> [JURIST report] in 2010. The UN has also donated <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">$9.3 million to fund piracy courts</a> [JURIST report] in Kenya and the Seychelles, the only two nations with such unique judicial bodies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Ivan Turudic found Sanader <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20121120-croatian-ex-pm-gets-10-years-graft">guilty</a> [AFP report] beyond a reasonable doubt and also ordered the former PM to pay a fine of &#8364;611,000 to Croatia. Sanader was charged with taking &#8364;10 million (USD $12.7 million) in bribes from the Hungarian energy company, <a href="http://www.mol.hu/en/">MOL</a> [corporate website], and for profiting from Croatia's war against the Serbs from 1991-1995. During the time these allegations took place, Sanader was serving as the deputy foreign minister for Croatia. Prosecutes sought the maximum 15-year sentence for the charges against Sanader, who denied all the allegations against him, criticizing charges as politically motivated. This judgment makes Sanader the highest ranking official to be convicted of corruption charges since the country gained independence in 1991.

<p>In September, Croatian prosecutors announced that they <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/croatia-ex-prime-minister-indicted-on-fifth-corruption-charge.php">charged Sanader</a> [JURIST report] with embezzlement relating to a real estate deal that took place during his time in office. Sanader was accused of using government funds to purchase a building in the capital city of Zagreb at an inflated price and stealing the surplus. Sanader and three associates, including former Farming Minister Petar Cobankovic, allegedly embezzled the funds in excess of the state-owned building's market value, with Sanader himself pocketing approximately &#8364;2.3 million (USD $2.8 million). Croatia is close to achieving membership in the EU, and Kosor hopes Sanader's trial will help ease pressure from Brussels for Croatia to sort out corruption and speed investigations. Sanader's trial is the first criminal proceeding prompted by EU pressure for Croatia to crack down on corruption. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/trial-postponed-for-former-croatia-pm.php">trial was postponed</a> [JURIST report] in October 2011 for health reasons. Sanader <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/croatia-ex-pm-pleads-not-guilty-to-additional-corruption-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] last November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law requires Russian NGOs financed from abroad and involved in political activity to be <a href="http://rapsinews.com/legislation_news/20121120/265436930.html">registered as foreign agents</a> [RAPSI report]. Some activists are already in the process of <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/russian-activists-to-challenge-ngo-law-at-europe-rights-court">appealing</a> [Reuters report] to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] over the law. According to Mikhail Fedotov, the head of <a href="http://www.president-sovet.ru/">Russian Presidential Council for Human Rights</a> [official website, in Russian], the law <a href="http://rt.com/politics/foreign-agents-bill-mistakes-152/">contains errors</a> [RT report] and must be amended. The new law entails fines of over USD $15,000 for organizations that fail to comply with the law. The word "foreign agent" in Russia is nearly synonymous with the word "spy" and many observers believe the law is <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20121120/177597400.html">intended to discredit</a> [RIA Novosti report] the work that NGOs do in Russia. To date not a single NGO in Russia has registered as a "foreign agent." 

<p>In August, Executive Director of Greenpeace International Kumi Naidoo called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/putin-urged-not-to-implement-ngo-foreign-agents-law.php">refrain from implementing</a> [JURIST report] the new law. Greenpeace International is not alone in its views of Russia's new "foreign agents" law. In July the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/21/us-russia-putin-ngos-idUSBRE86K05M20120721">claimed</a> [Reuters report] it had "deep concern" about the new bill, but was likewise reminded by Moscow that such an issue involves domestic rather than international policy. Russia's <a href="http://www.council.gov.ru/eng/index.html">Federal Council</a> [official website], the upper house of parliament, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-approves-bill-labeling-many-ngos-foreign-agents.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in July much to the dismay of Putin's critics, who consider the bill an effort to <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/russian-federation-council-approves-foreign-agent-ngo-bill/24649114.html">curb free speech</a> [RFE/RL report] and the right to assemble. Additionally, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/18/us-un-pillay-russia-idUSBRE86H0VB20120718">stated</a> [Reuters report] that Putin's recent regime is regressing into a more restrictive, Soviet-style type of government where freedoms are not recognized. The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-parliament-passes-bill-restricting-ngos-and-re-criminalizing-libel.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/">State Duma</a> [official website, in Russian], the lower house of parliament, only a few days prior.

The girl was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-20/pakistan-court-scraps-blasphemy-case-against-christian-girl-1-.html">charged</a> [Bloomberg report] under Pakistan's blasphemy law for allegedly burning pages for a Koran. She was released on bail in September after an Iman was charged for allegedly framing the young girl. The judge explained that no one had seen the girl burning the Koran. Pakistan passed a blasphemy law in 1987, which outlaws insulting either the Koran or the Prophet Muhammad. A violation of this law is punishable by imprisonment and even death. No one has been executed under this law so far. This case has sparked criticism both within Pakistan and around the world that the blasphemy law is being used to suppress Pakistan's Christian minority population. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blasphemy+law">Blasphemy laws</a> [JURIST news archive] in Pakistan carry <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/pakistan-president-blasphemy-laws-must-not-be-misused.php">penalties</a> [JURIST report] ranging from a fine to capital punishment. In August, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said that the country's blasphemy laws would not be misused to persecute religious beliefs. Zardari's comments came after the young girl's arrest. Police said after the girl's arrest that she may have Down syndrome. Blasphemy laws are currently in effect in several countries around the world. In July the US Department of State <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/us-state-department-releases-religious-freedom-report.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual International Religious Freedom Report, documenting threats to religious freedom throughout the world. The report documents current international threats to religious freedom&#8212;particularly laws that punish religious traditions and blasphemy laws that are often used to punish religious tolerance. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay expressed acute concern over the surge in the number of Palestinian civilians killed and injured over the past 48 hours as a result of Israeli military action. As to whether any of these attacks constitute war crimes, the High Commissioner emphasized that it would depend on the specific circumstances, particularly a given party's effort to distinguish between combatants and civilians, precautions to avoid civilian casualties, and refraining from launching an attack when it is expected to cause excessive loss of civilian life in relation to the anticipated military advantage. In <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/20/palestinians-israel-humanitarian-idUSL5E8MK6MG20121120">response</a> [Reuters report] to the rising civilian death toll and the dozens of Gazan schools and religious sites damaged by the bombings, <a href="http://www.unicef.org">UNICEF</a> [official website] said that children in Gaza were suffering from severe psycho-social distress that refrain them from sleeping, going out in public and engaging in social activities.

<p>Last week Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohammed+Morsi">news archive</a>] announced that peace talks were progressing toward a ceasefire in the recent escalation of violence in Gaza and Southern Israel, and reports Tuesday indicated that an agreement is close at hand. The ceasefire discussions between Morsi, the Quatari emir, Turkish <correction num=1><a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/site/yonetim/genel-baskan">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official profile, in Turkish]</correction> and former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal came a day after Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-calls-for-ceasefire-in-gaza.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] a cessation of the continued indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilians. In Israel, rocket fire from Gaza has resulted in three deaths as well as many counts of civilian injury and damage to civilian property. In August <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/israel-urged-to-investigate-mistreatment-of-palestinian-detainees.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its treatment of Palestinian detainees, alleging that two had been mistreated.

Limaj allegedly ordered the torture and killings of Serbian detainees in 1999. The Supreme Court panel consisted of three <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/en/front/">European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website] judges and two local judges and was presided by a EULEX judge. Limaj was originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/kosovo-politician-on-trial-for-war-crimes.php">tried</a> in 2011 and was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/kosovo-politican-acquitted-on-war-crimes-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Much of the prosecution's case relied upon the testimony of a former member of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), who was found hanged in September in an apparent suicide. The panel ruled that the former KLA member's testimony would be admissible on retrial. 

<p>EULEX has been <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">investigating war crimes</a> [JURIST report] since December 2008. An influential figure in the ruling <a href="http://www.pdk49.com/index.php?page=1,1">Democratic Party of Kosovo</a> [official website, in Albanian], Limaj was excluded from a cabinet position following international pressure not to include corrupt officials but was elected into the Kosovo parliament. Limaj is an ex-member of the KLA and is viewed as a liberator by many ethnic Albanians. In 2005, Limaj was acquitted of similar charges by a war crimes tribunal in The Hague because of insufficient evidence. An EU judge in September 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-judge-places-senior-kosovo-politician-under-house-arrest-on-suspicion-of-war-crimes.php">placed Limaj under house arrest</a> after EULEX <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/eu-kosovo-authorities-charge-10-for-war-crimes.php">charged 10 former members of the KLA</a> [JURIST reports], including Limaj, with war crimes for their actions during the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The criminal charges were brought in the <a href="http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] for "conspiring to provide material support and resources to terrorists." The allegations include "conspiracy to kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage property in a foreign country, killing and attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States, killing nationals of the United States, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction outside the Unites States, and bombing places of public use and government facilities." The plot began in 2010 when alleged instigator Sohiel Omar Kabir introduced Ralph Deleon, Miguel Alejandro Santana Virdales, and Arifeen David Gojali to extremist Islam and "violent jihad." Confidential FBI sources were used to infiltrate the group and receive information regarding their plans. Kabir is alleged to have arranged meetings in Afghanistan with fellow jihadists, and the three men devised a series of plans to be executed in mid-November including meeting Kabir overseas. Kabir was arrested in Afghanistan. Santana, Gojali, and Deloen were taken into custody on Friday by authorities in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/jttf">Joint Terrorism Task Force</a> [official website]. The investigation is ongoing, and if convicted the four could face up to 15 years in federal prison.

<p>This is not the first case dealing with alleged al Qaeda operatives with strong US connections. In October the US District Court for the Western District of Washington sentenced <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/millennium-bomber-sentenced-to-37-years-in-prison.php/">Ahmed Ressam</a> [JURIST report], an al Qaeda trained terrorist convicted of plotting to bomb Los Angeles International Airport on New Year's Eve 1999. Also in October an Iraqi court sentenced an American citizen to life in prison for funding terrorist activities in Iraq and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/iraq-court-sentences-us-citizen-to-life-in-prison-for-aiding-al-qaeda.php/">aiding al Qaeda</a> [JURIST report]. In June </a href="/paperchase/2012/06/us-terror-suspect-pleads-guilty-to-aiding-al-qaeda.php/">Wesam El-Hanafi pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] before the US District Court for the Southern District of New York of providing material support to al Qaeda. In 2008 Jaber Elbaneh, a Yemeni-American, was charged for alleged participation in acts of international terrorism including <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/alleged-lackawanna-six-terrorist.php">involvement with al Qaeda</a> [JURIST report].   </p>]]></content:encoded>

The findings were based on numerous interviews of detained children, their families and lawyers. HRW condemned the situation in Egypt for violating national and international laws that require children to be separated from adults during different stages of legal proceedings. It was discovered that most of the arrested children were detained alongside adults and were subject to trials in adult courts rather than the juvenile justice system. HRW says officials also have failed to respect families' right to visit and have given incorrect information about the children's location. Children were reportedly questioned before they were appointed counsel, violating numerous national and international laws. The report claims that 20 percent of all arrested person during five protests were children under age of 18. HRW also noted that although Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohammed+Morsi">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-president-announces-general-pardon-for-crimes-committed-during-revolution.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST report] last month which would end the prosecution of children, it only extended to those arrested before the end of June, excluding children who were arrested during the September protests. HRW says that at least 136 children were arrested during those protests.

<p>There have been several controversial trials since the end of the Egyptian revolution. At the end of September Egyptian Defence Minister General Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-soldiers-receive-suspended-sentences-for-protests.php">ordered a reduced sentence</a> [JURIST report] for a group of military officers who took part in opposition protests in April 2011. There were 22 officers, known as the April 8 Officers, arrested for their participation in protests in support of the revolution and against the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/category/organisation/armed-forces-supreme-council">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [Al Jazeera archive] and against retired Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi Soliman. Also in September, an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/jurist-an-egyptian-criminal-court.php">upheld the death sentences</a> for 14 Islamists while another court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/egypt-court-sentences-former-pm-to-three-years-for-corruption.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] former prime minister Ahmed Nazif to three years for corruption. In August the former secretary for Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges.

Pillay stated that M23, advancing through the DRC, has recently committed many human rights violations, including wounding and abducting civilians, looting and destroying property and threatening journalists. Pillay also expressed concern about looting and the destruction of property by the FARDC and urged that <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43548&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo#.UKvVe4d3g9Y">all parties take precautions</a> [press release] to protect civilians. The fighting has also harmed humanitarian aid efforts to 60,000 displaced persons in the region. Estimates place the number of DRC refugees in neighboring countries at 463,000 and 2.4 million internally displaced persons in the DRC itself.

<p>The violence and unrest in the eastern part of the DRC has been a focus of the international community. In an emergency meeting on Saturday, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a series of guerrilla attacks by M23 rebel group in the DRC. The condemnation followed a recent attack by the group in the eastern region of the DRC as they tried to advance to Goma. Last week, a UN rights body <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-investigation-in-drc-reveals-mass-execution-of-civilians.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] that confirmed the arbitrary executions of at least 264 civilians. Last month Ugandan officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uganda-official-denies-support-of-congo-rebels.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] UN Security Council allegations that Uganda had helped assisting M23 rebels with troops and supplies in the DRC.

These weapons systems are essentially robots that would be able to operate without human direction or interaction, and while they have yet to be used in a combat zone, they are in development for future conflicts. The report expresses concern that, in addition to potential lack of accountability for the effects of the weapons' use, the weapons "inherently lack human qualities that provide legal and non-legal checks on the killing of civilians." The report had a number of recommendations including encouraging countries to:<blockquote>Prohibit the development, production, and use of fully autonomous weapons through an international legally binding instrument. ... Adopt national laws and policies to prohibit the development, production, and use of fully autonomous weapons. ... [and] Commence reviews of technologies and components that could lead to fully autonomous weapons. These reviews should take place at the very beginning of the development process and continue throughout the development and testing phases.</blockquote>Finally, HRW advocated the creation of a "professional code of conduct governing the research and development of autonomous robotic weapons."

<p>The use of high technology weapons, including robots, unmanned drones, and cybersecurity attacks, present a myriad of new problems for law- and policy-makers, military planners and the public at large. The challenges include determining which technologies should be permitted, the limits to the manner in which they will be used and the definition of accountability for the results of the various tools. In July, US lawmakers, at a hearing before the <a href="http://homeland.house.gov/">US House Committee on Homeland Security</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/lawmakers-concerned-over-use-of-drones-within-us.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the use of unmanned drones and sought information on their domestic use and their potential security and safety implications. In April the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted to <a href="paperchase/2012/04/us-house-approves-controversial-cybersecurity-bill.php">approve a controversial cybersecurity bill</a> [JURIST report] that would allow private companies and the federal government to exchange private security information. In April 2007 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/german-high-court-rejects-police.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that police in Germany are not permitted to secretly access computer and Internet data stored on suspects' computers without proper authorization.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court will consider whether a party can raise the takings clause as a defense when charged by the government to transfer funds, rather than raising the claim after already complying with the government's mandate. The court will also determine if the <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] properly <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Horne_v_USDA_673_F3d_1071_9th_Cir_2012_Court_Opinion">waived jurisdiction</a> [opinion] on the issue when they ruled that the <a href = "http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] should have jurisdiction. A group of vineyards in California evaded a <a href = "http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> [official website] regulation that a certain percentage of raisin crops be kept off the market in a reserve by selling the raisins directly rather than sending them to processors to sell. The Department of Agriculture's regulation limited processors rather than producers, for the purpose of keeping market prices regulated. The vineyard owners were then fined $483,844.

Human rights advocacy groups, such as HRW, see this mass execution as a step backward for the country's weak legal system and as a revelation on the progress that has yet to be made. Under Afghan law, when a court delivers a death sentence, the president must then sign a death warrant for the execution to occur. According to officials, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3135938.stm">President Hamid Karzai</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/21/us-afghanistan-executions-idUSBRE8AK0I320121121">signed off</a> [Reuters report] on each of the eight executions. Judicially sanctioned executions have been rare since the Taliban fell, and the country has experienced unofficial death penalty moratoriums from 2001 to 2004, and from 2008 until recently. Until Tuesday's hangings, only two people had been executed in the last four years.

<p>The Afghan government's human rights record has been under scrutiny in the past. In March HRW called on the Afghan government to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-human-rights-watch-hrw-1.php">release women and girls imprisoned</a> [JURIST report] for "moral crimes," many of which involve flight from unlawful forced marriage or domestic violence and "zina," which is sex outside of marriage due to rape or forced prostitution. In December 2011 HRW said that the Afghan government had <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/afghanistan-civilians-struggle-to-exercise-human-rights-hrw.php">failed to ensure and protect human rights</a> [JURIST report] since the Taliban government ended 10 years ago. The report alleged that in the last 10 years, the Afghanistan justice system had "remain[ed] weak" and that human rights abuses were rampant in the alternative traditional justice system, where civilians are often forced to resolve disputes in Taliban courts. In July 2010 the advocacy group <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/afghanistan-government-must-protect-women%27s-rights-during-reconciliation-efforts:-hrw.php">criticized Karzai's integration and reconciliation efforts</a> [JURIST report] to end the conflict with the Taliban and other insurgent groups, claiming that women's rights were bypassed in order to reach an expedient solution. Among HRW's criticisms was the president's decision to sign the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/afghanistan-president-signs-law.php">Shia Personal Status Law</a> [JURIST report], which legalized rape within marriage, and his pardon of two convicted rapists.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pakistani national <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2012/08/29/timeline-the-trial-of-mohammed-ajmal-kasab/">Mohammad Ajmal Kasab</a> [WSJ backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kasab">news archive</a>] was <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/21/mumbai-terror-attacks-gunman-hanged">hanged and buried in the prison yard</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the central Indian city of Pune just days before the fourth anniversary of the Mumbai attacks. Kasab was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/india-court-convicts-mumbai.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in May 2010 on more than 80 charges of waging war against India, multiple murders and conspiracy for his participation in the attacks, during which the group of gunmen killed more than 160 people in three days of targeted assaults on luxury hotels, Mumbai's main railway station and a Jewish cultural center. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] and other human rights groups decried the hanging as a step backward for the Indian government, which has not carried out an execution since 2004. AI further charged that India <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/kasab-execution-represents-indian-death-penalty-backslide-2012-11-21">violated international standards on the use of the death penalty</a> [AI report] because Kasab's lawyer and family in Pakistan were not informed of the decision to execute. The execution was carried out two days after the UN General Assembly <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/third/index.shtml">human rights committee</a> [official website] adopted its fourth <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-20422270">draft resolution calling for a moratorium</a> [BBC report] on executions&#8212;110 nations voted in favor of the adoption, and 39 countries, including India and the US, voted against.

<p>One day before Kasab's execution the Indian <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] criticized the inconsistent application of the court's own <a href="/paperchase/IndiaSCt-11202012.pdf">32-year-old "rarest of rare" standard</a> [judgment, PDF] for imposition of the death penalty in India: "If the court finds, but not otherwise, that the offence is of an exceptionally depraved and heinous character and constitutes, on account of its design and the manner of its execution, a source of grave danger to the society at large, the court may impose the death sentence." Regardless the court had already <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/india-high-court-affirms-death-sentence-for-gunman-in-mumbai-attacks.php">upheld Kasab's death sentence</a> [JURIST report] in August, finding the shootings to be a cross-border terrorist attack warranting "rarest of rare" punishment. The court had <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/india-high-court-stays-execution-of-mumbai-gunman.php">stayed the execution</a> in October 2011 after Kasab <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/mumbai-terror-attack-gunman-appeals-death-sentence.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging his <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/india-court-convicts-mumbai.php">death sentence</a> [JURIST reports], which was ultimately upheld.

Colonel Abdi Aden Magan did <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2019721217_apussomaliatortureclaim.html">not present any evidence</a> [AP report] to dispute allegations that he directed subordinates to carry out human rights abuses under the regime of former military dictator <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/03/obituaries/somalia-s-overthrown-dictator-mohammed-siad-barre-is-dead.html">Mohammed Siad Barre</a> [NYT profile]. Lawyer and human rights advocate Abukar Hassan Ahmed had alleged three months of torture under the orders of Col. Magan, who at the time served as investigations chief of the National Security Service of Somalia, dubbed the "Black SS" or the "Gestapo of Somalia" due to techniques used to gain confessions from detainees. The <a href="http://www.cja.org/index.php">Center for Justice and Accountability</a> (CJA) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?list=type&type=422">lawsuit</a> [CJA materials] on behalf of Ahmed in 2010, when Magan was residing in Ohio. Initially Magan <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-torture-suit-against-former-somali-colonel.php">argued for dismissal</a> [JURIST report] because the lawsuit was filed in the wrong county and too long after the alleged abuse occurred. After spending some time fighting the allegations Magan left the US for Kenya and has not responded to subsequent court motions. Judge George Smith will now hold a financial determination hearing where Ahmed can testify about the abuse he suffered, but since Magan has left the US it is uncertain whether Ahmed could ever actually receive any damages.

<p>In August the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-awards-21-million-in-lawsuit-against-former-somalia-pm.php">awarded $21 million</a> [JURIST report] to seven Somalis in separate CJA <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?list=type&type=85">lawsuit</a> [CJA materials] against former Somali prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=samantar">Mohamed Ali Samantar</a> [JURIST news archive]. The lawsuit, which started in 2004 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-foreign-officials-not-immune-from-suit.php">made it to the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] in 2010, alleged Samantar was responsible for the killing and torture of members of the Isaaq clan in Somalia throughout the 1980s under former dictator Siad Barre. In April 2011 the Virginia court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/former-somalia-pm-can-be-questioned-under-oath-in-federal-suit.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the lawsuit against Samantar, whose lawyers had argued for dismissal because the statute of limitations had expired and because the courts should not interfere in political matters. That February a federal judge had ruled that Samantar was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-denies-immunity-to-former-somalia-pm.php">not entitled to legal immunity from civil lawsuits</a> [JURIST report], following the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> (FSIA) [28 USC &#167;&#167; 1330, 1602 et seq. text] does not provide foreign officials immunity from civil lawsuits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lessee of 7 World Trade Center (Tower 7), which collapsed from the flaming debris resulting out of the crash of Flight 11 into the 1 World Trade Center, sued several defendants including United Airlines and American Airlines arguing that they were responsible for the collapse of Tower 7. The plaintiff in this case claimed that "United had a legal duty and a clear chance to prevent the hijacking of American Airlines Flight 11 when Atta and his accomplice passed through the Portland security checkpoint for which United has shared responsibility." However, District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, citing <span class="casename">Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co.</span>, held that United did not owe duty of care to the plaintiff because:<blockquote>It was not within United's range of apprehension that terrorists would slip through the PWM security screening checkpoint, fly to Logan, proceed through another air carrier's security screening and board that air carrier's flight, hijack the flight and crash it into I World Trade Center, let alone that 1 World Trade Center would therefore collapse and cause Tower 7 to collapse.</blockquote>The Lessee stated that he will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/21/us-usa-worldtradecenter-airlines-idUSBRE8AK0WQ20121121">continue to pursue claims</a> [Reuters report] against United concerning Flight 175, which crashed into 2 World Trade Center.

<p>Wednesday's ruling deviated significantly from a previous ruling by Hellerstein. In September, he ruled that American Airlines and United Continental Holdings <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rules-airlines-must-stand-trial-for-911-negligence-claim.php">must stand trial to defend</a> [JURIST report] against a claim by World Trade Center Properties (WTCP), the owners of the World Trade Center towers, who claim that the negligence of the airlines allowed the hijackers aboard the planes which eventually destroyed the towers on 9/11. In so holding, he rejected the defendants' claim that the airlines should not be required to go to trial as WTCP already recovered from insurance companies. In 2007 a <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/world-trade-center-insurance-settlement.php">$4.09 billion settlement was reached</a> [JURIST report] between insurance companies and WTCP. WTCP was seeking damages from the airlines in the range of $8.4 billion, which they estimate would be the cost of replacing the two towers. The judge in that case has limited to their earnings to the "lesser of fair market value or replacement cost" of the towers which he has put at $2.805 billion&#8212;the price WTCO agreed to pay the for the lease for the towers two months prior to the 9/11 attack.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Contrary to the government's commitment to implementing the recommendations <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">set forth</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.bici.org.bh/">Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry</a> (BICI) [official website] a year ago, AI claims the country has become more repressive by <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-government-bans-all-protests.php">banning all gatherings</a> [JURIST report] violating citizens' right of free expression and peaceful assembly. Moreover, AI documented continued abuse of power by security forces against protesters. In response, violence against law enforcement officials increased during the recent weeks resulting in the death of two police officers during a riot. However, AI said that violent protests could not excuse the government's failure to implement measures that ensure human rights. It also argued that BICI's recommendation should guide the government in preventing an escalation of violence and in establishing rule of law within the country.

<p>Bahrain has faced international criticism for its crackdown against dissidents since anti-government protests began last year. Earlier this month the Bahrain government <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bahrain-extends-detention-of-leading-human-rights-activist.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] the detention of <a href="https://twitter.com/SAIDYOUSIF">Sayed Yousif Al-Muhafda</a> [official Twitter], a leading human rights activist. He had been arrested during an unauthorized protest a week before. In October Bahrain appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-upholds-convictions-against-two-teachers-for-organizing-strike-efforts.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] verdicts against two teachers for organizing a teachers' strike early last year to support anti-government protests. During the same month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Bahrain's court of appeals to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-center-for-human-rights-urges-king-to-release-their-leader.php">overturn</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of human right advocate <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nabeel+rajab">Nabeel Rajab</a> [JURIST news archive].

The Security Council urged the international community to develop a comprehensive response to discourage these acts. The Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 2077, which renewed pressure on States and regional organizations to fight sea crimes. The resolution called on member states to enact domestic legislation that criminalizes piracy and to assist Somalia in prosecuting pirates. The Security Council requests that Somalia work with the UN to enact a comprehensive set of anti-piracy laws. The resolution also called on States to investigate illegal fishing and dumping. The resolution states: <blockquote>He also stressed that allegations of illegal fishing and illegal dumping off the Somali coast, as presented in the Secretary-General's report, must be fully investigated, lest the impression be created that the Council was willing to act to curb piracy only because the vital economic interests of some countries were threatened.  He added that the absence of a declared maritime economic zone must not be used to justify the illegal exploitation of Somali resources.  There was nothing in the Convention on the Law of the Sea that suggested that the existence of such a zone was subjected to its declaration by the coastal State.</blockquote> The resolution said that anti-piracy laws and maritime law enforcement are an integral part of combating piracy.

<p>Earlier this week UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson stressed the need to address the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/senior-un-official-calls-for-multi-dimensional-approach-to-fighting-piracy.php">causes of maritime piracy</a> [JURIST report] with a "multi-dimensional approach". Addressing the UN Security Council, Eliasson noted three areas of concern that warrant immediate action: 1) better coordination, information-sharing and trust-building among countries and agencies involved in counter-piracy operations; 2) stronger capacity to prosecute piracy cases and imprison those convicted in accordance with international human rights standards; and 3) the establishment of a framework governing the use of privately contracted armed security personnel on board vessels. Last month the Hanseatic Higher Regional Court of Hamburg <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/germany-court-convicts-10-somali-pirates.php">issued sentences</a> [JURIST report] for 10 Somalis who were involved in the hijacking the German freighter MS Taipan off the coast of Somalia two years ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A spokesperson for Lululemon said that the terms of the settlement are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/20/lululemon-patents-idUSL1E8MKE7R20121120?type=companyNews">confidential</a> [Reuters report]. After both companies agreed to settle, Lululemon withdrew the case in a filing in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. In Lululemon Athletica Canada, Inc., v. Calvin Klein, Inc., Lululemon sued Calvin Klein for unspecified damages for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-20/lululemon-calvin-klein-settle-lawsuit-over-yoga-pants.html">infringement</a> [Bloomberg report] of three different patents. Specifically one <a href="/dateline/2012/10/cory-howard-patent-law.php">design patent</a> [JURIST op-ed] protecting the distinctive waistband around Lululemon's best-selling yoga pants. The patent protects all Lululemon products sold in the US, including their famous Astro Pant name.

<p>JURIST Guest Columnist Louise Lau <a href="/dateline/2012/11/louise-lau-intellectual-property.php">analyzed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the effects that Lululemon's design patent lawsuit against Calvin Klein might have on the fashion industry in a Dateline piece. "In an industry that has traditionally accepted inspiration and appropriation as the status quo, Lululemon Athletica's lawsuit against Calvin Klein Inc., speaks loudly to the shifting paradigm of the application of intellectual property law to the fashion industry. The high-end yoga and sports apparel maker filed a complaint in the US District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Calvin Klein's Performance Pant infringes on Lululemon's design patent for its Astro Pant. Design patents offer protection to the ornamental features of a creation. This presents challenges in the fashion industry because the limited life of certain pieces from season to season rarely warrant a patent."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a vote of 108 to 1, the UNGA amended the resolution to include language urging states around the world "to investigate...all killings committed for any discriminatory reason, including sexual orientation or gender identity." The UNGA's approval of the amendment effectively overturned a <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/pressroom/pressrelease/1257.html">2010 resolution</a> [press release] that removed references to protection from extrajudicial execution on the basis of "sexual orientation." Rights groups from around the world have praised the UNGA's decision to support protections from discriminatory execution based on LGBT status. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International's</a> [advocacy website] UN representative, Jose Luis Diaz said Wednesday: "The [UNGA] sent a strong message, reaffirming everyone must be protected from extrajudicial killings." Changes in the resolution were originally introduced by Sweden and co-sponsored by 34 states from around the world.

<p>Sexual orientation and LGBT rights continue to be a contentious issue in societies worldwide. In July UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-sexual-orientation-discrimination.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] human rights activists for their work to protect LGBT rights while calling for an end to discrimination based on sexual orientation and stressing that violence and discrimination against the LGBT community is a human rights violation. In June Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/hrw-calls-on-bulgaria-to-denounce-anti-gay-violence.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Bulgarian Justice Minister Diana Kovacheva to denounce calls to violence by anti-gay groups in anticipation of a LGBT pride parade in Sofia, Bulgaria. During the same month, Ugandan Minister of State for Ethics and Integrity Simon Lokodo <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-official-government-not-discriminating-based-on-sexual-orientation.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the government was not discriminating based on sexual orientation. The statement came days after the government had <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/uganda-government-banning-organizations-for-promoting-gay-rights.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it would ban at least 38 non-governmental organizations that are accused of recruiting children to homosexuality. </p>]]></content:encoded>

HTC and Apple announced earlier this month that they had <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/apple-htc-reach-patent-settlement.php">reached a global settlement</a> [JURIST report] dismissing all patent lawsuits between the two companies. Samsung hopes that the settlement details will help the company at a hearing scheduled for December over Apple's bid for a permanent US sales ban on eight Samsung smartphone models and one tablet computer. Samsung has also requested that the court add the iPod Touch 5, the iPad 4, and the iPad mini to the list of Apple devices that it claims have infringed on Samsung patents.  

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world.  In October, the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent.  In the same month a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent.  In the same time frame Apple appealed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents.  At the beginning of October, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uk-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apples-design.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product.  Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.  <br />

On Friday <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20458148">protests</a> [BBC report] broke out in Cairo and several other cities throughout the country as a result of the decree. In Tahrir Square, thousands of protesters chanted "Mursi is Mubarak... revolution everywhere." In Geneva, Rupert Colville, the spokesperson for U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay, said Morsi's decree <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/23/us-egypt-decree-un-rights-idUSBRE8AM0AF20121123">raises serious human rights concerns</a> [Reuters report]. 

<p>At the end of October, Egyptian Prosecutor-General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-prosecutor-orders-investigation-into-alleged-presidential-election-fraud.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations of forgery during the recent presidential elections. The order came after former Egyptian prime minister Ahmed Shafiq alleged that ballots were forged and votes were bought by Morsi. Shafiq is one of the many former politicians under Mubarak's regime who are facing corruption charges. In August the former secretary for Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges. He was accused of having abused his office by obtaining real estate at discounted prices and illegally obtaining $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, along with seven others, <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mubaraks-sons-charged-with-stock-market-fraud.php">were charged</a> [JURIST report] with stock market fraud and using unfair trading practices and illegally manipulating the market. In June Hosni Mubarak was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ex-egypt-president-mubarak-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life</a> [JURIST report] after an Egyptian court found him guilty of complicity to kill protesters during the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Arab Spring protests</a> [JURIST backgrounder].

Pursuant to the warrant, Simone Gbagbo is accused of committing crimes against humanity during Ivory Coast&#8217;s post-election crisis in 2010 - 2011. She is accused of planning and implementing a plan that involved murder, sexual violence, other inhumane acts and persecution in collaboration with her husband and other government officials. According to the arrest warrant: <blockquote>Although not elected, Ms Gbagbo acted as an alter ego for her husband, exercising the power to make State decisions. Ms Gbagbo was also close to other members of Mr Gbagbo's inner circle who were involved in the implementation of the Common Plan. Moreover, at meetings or public gatherings during the post-election crisis, Ms Gbagbo expressed her support for the Common Plan, and instructed the pro-Gbagbo forces to commit crimes against individuals who posed a threat to her husband's power.</blockquote> This is the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22048505/wife-former-ivory-coast-leader-wanted-by-icc">first time</a> [AP report] in the ICC's history that it has charged a female. 

<p>The violence that followed the 2010 election claimed approximately 3,000 lives. Gbagbo's rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alassane+ouattara">news archive</a>] was declared the winner of the 2010 election and is now president. At the beginning of this month, Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC found Laurent Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-finds-ivory-coast-ex-president-fit-to-stand-trial-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. In October, the ICC denied Gbagbo's motion <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-refuses-to-allow-pre-trial-leave-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">asking the court for allowance to leave</a> [JURIST report] the Netherlands while he recovers from alleged maltreatment received while detained by national authorities in the Ivory Coast before being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">surrendered to the ICC</a> [JURIST report] in November. The court denied Gbagbo's leave request upon a determination that he posed a flight risk. In August the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-rejects-ex-ivory-coast-presidents-jurisdiction-challenge.php">dismissed a jurisdiction challenge</a> [JURIST report] by Gbagbo, ruling that the court has the authority to hear the case. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icc-agrees-to-postpone-hearing-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">first postponed Gbagbo's confirmation of charges hearing</a> in June, after his lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ivory-coast-ex-president-asks-to-postpone-icc-hearing.php">asked the court more time to prepare</a> [JURIST reports], complaining that they did not have enough resources to build their case in the amount of time given.

District Judge Thomas Griesa for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] in his decision stated that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-22/argentina-must-pay-1-33-billion-to-owners-of-bonds.html">"Argentina must pay the debts it owes"</a> [Bloomberg report]. Lorenzino, in response to the ruling, stated during the press conference that the ruling was unfair and that Argentina will seek any and all methods to protect the country's interest. In addition, Lorenzino indicated that Argentina will appeal the ruling to the US Supreme Court if necessary and is willing to resort to any international body available. 

<p>In October, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-orders-argentina-to-pay-more-than-1-billion-to-investors.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Argentina must pay $1.33 billion to bondholders when it repays its debts stemming from an economic collapse in 2001. The Second Circuit affirmed a district court ruling that Argentina breached a promise when it prioritized paying holders of its restructured debt over the bondholders who held its defaulted debt. In August the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/second-circuit-rejects-argentina-sovereign-immunity-argument-upholds-judgments.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Argentina's attempt to prevent bondholders from acquiring bank documents regarding the country's assets outside US territory, declaring that sovereign immunity was not an acceptable defense in this case. In September 2011 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/second-circuit-rejects-argentina-sovereign-immunity-argument-upholds-judgments.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Argentina had to comply with subpoenas requested by <a href="http://www.nmlcapital.com/">NML Capital Ltd.</a> [corporate website], one of the bondholders of Argentina's debts, for the collection of five money judgments totaling about $1.6 billion.<br />

Marking the third anniversary of the infamous mass murder of journalists, AI's Deputy Asia-Pacific Director Polly Truscott remarked that as witnesses and the families of victims have become engulfed by a long and tenuous legal battle, "some are also living with the very real threat of death." According to Philippine police reports, three relatives of witnesses were killed this year alone. Additionally, a number of different witnesses who have come forward announcing their willingness to testify in court have been killed over the course of the last three years. The violence that continues throughout the Philippines stems from the November 2009 killing of 57 people, including 32 journalists, by an armed group of <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2009/1124/philippines-massacre-the-story-behind-the-accused-ampatuan-clan">Andal Ampatuan loyalists</a> [CSM backgrounder] who overtook a campaign envoy affiliated with Ampatuan's political rival Esmael Mangudadatu. 

<p>Litigation surrounding the Maguindanao massacre has been a source of contentious debate. Earlier this month, the Philippines high court had <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/11/philippines-high-court-rescinds-decision-to-broadcast-maguindanao-massacre-trial.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] their year-old decision to allow for a live broadcast of the trial, a rescission that was opposed by Philippines President Benigno S. Aquino III on the grounds that it could impede the transparency of the trial. In June 2011, the court also <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/06/philippines-court-freezes-23-million-assets-of-massacre-suspects.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] to freeze $23 million in assets belonging to massacre suspects. According to the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [official website], the Maguindanao massacre is the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/2012/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2011-philippines.php">single deadliest event for the press</a> [CPJ report] since the CPJ began keeping records of journalists deaths in 1992. In the last twenty years, at least 72 journalists have been killed for their work in the Philippines, making it the second deadliest country in the world for journalists behind Iraq. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The UNHCR and its affiliates typically oversee 31 refugee camps hosting over 108,000 people in the eastern province of the <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13283212">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Democratic+Republic+of+the+Congo">news archives</a>], but fighting in the region has restricted access to nearly all of these camps. According to UNHCR spokesperson Adrian Edwards, humanitarian aid can reach only one camp, Mugunga III, located west of the provincial capital Goma. Kouassi Lazare Etien, the head of the UNHCR's office in Goma, visited Mugunga III on Thursday for the first time since the rebel group <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">23 March Movement</a> (M23) [JURIST news archives] captured the city on Tuesday. According to Etien, a head count was conducted by local partners on Friday to gauge the number of refugees in the camp and determine the most vulnerable. The UNHCR is also concerned about violence against civilians in Goma and the nearby town Sake, and is appealing to all parties to the conflict to avoid placing civilians in harm's way.

<p>The UN has been increasingly concerned about the actions of M23 against civilians over the past several months. Last Tuesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] also <a href="paperchase/2012/11/un-concerned-over-human-rights-violations-in-eastern-drc.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for civilians in Eastern DRC caught in the continued fighting between the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) and M23. This was a concern she had previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/conflict-in-drc-threatens-civilians-un-rights-chief.php">voiced in June</a> [JURIST report], stating that civilians have been in heightened danger since the fighting began. In an emergency meeting on Saturday, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] reiterated its <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemnation of M23</a> [JURIST report] after a series of guerrilla attacks that displaced 4,000 civilians. It called for an end to all support for the rebel group and demanded that M23 end its attacks. The Security Council had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/security-council-reaffirms-condemnation-of-democratic-republic-of-congo-renegade-soldiers.php">previously condemned M23</a> [JURIST report] in early August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Vasilyeva is currently <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ally-russian-defense-minister-charged-17791587#.ULEL3OOe_mo">under house arrest</a> [AP report] and her request for bail was dismissed, although her laywers intend to appeal the dismissal. A <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/23/russia-embezzlement-idUSL5E8MN8FB20121123">raid on her house last month</a> [Reuters report] revealed valuable paintings, rare antiques and more than 100 expensive rings. While Vasilyeva was head of the department, one of its firms created a loss of at least 3 billion rubles ($96 million) allegedly by <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324352004578137312820023022.html?mod=googlenews_wsj#articleTabs%3Darticle">selling properties to insider companies</a> [AP report].  Russian President Vladimir Putin also <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/06/russia-defence-idUSL5E8M632V20121106">fired</a> [Reuters report] Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov earlier this month because of corruption investigations in the ministry, but Serdyukov has not come under investigation himself. Besides Vasilyeva, <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20121123/177699118.html">two others have been charged</a> [RIA Novosti report] in the investigation. If convicted, Vasilyeva could be sentenced to six years in prison.

<p>Russia recently dealt with another corruption case involving oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mikhail+Khodorkovsky">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of fraud, theft and money laundering last year. Earlier this month his business partner, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Platon+Lebedev">news archive</a>], received a <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-court-reduces-sentence-for-khodorkovsky-partner.php">three-year reduction</a> [JURIST report] to his sentence. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are each serving prison sentences for fraud, theft and money laundering that should last until 2016. In July, a senior Russian judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-judge-orders-court-review-of-khodorkovsky-appeal.php">ordered a court to review</a> [JURIST report] Khodorkovsky's appeal. Opposition leaders and other groups have shown skepticism about the validity of Khodorkovsky's sentence. Last year, former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/%22">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister Vladimir Putin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the Communist Party without first getting approval to do so from the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICA was established under Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/arizonarevisedstatutes.asp?title=23">Workers' Compensation Act</a> [text] to administer the State Compensation Fund, created to pay compensation benefits to injured workers. The Court of Appeals stated that the ICA Special Fund is a public fund subject to legislative control, rather than a trust, and therefore the transfer is allowed under Arizona's constitution. Furthermore, while court acknowledged that the employers and employees have a vested interest in the Special Fund, it held that there was no evidence that the transfer would "impair the ability of the Special Fund to meet its obligations for the relevant fiscal year." An appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court <a href="http://azdailysun.com/news/local/state-and-regional/court-of-appeals-overturns-ruling-against-state-on-fund-raid/article_62fd45f1-1b7e-505a-a520-699b1a9d815b.html">remains a possibility</a> [Arizona Daily Sun report]. 

<p>Friday's decision overruled a trial court decision in favor of the ICA, which held that the funds were "insurance proceeds held in trust for the benefit of employees and employers by the Workers' Compensation Act" and that those employees and employers had vested rights in the ICA Special Fund. The lawsuit is a challenge to <a href="http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/49leg/1r/bills/hb2051h.htm&Session_ID=87">HB 2051</a> [text], which Governor <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Jan Brewer</a> [official website] signed into law in 2009. It was challenged by the ICA itself, as well as interest groups including the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a>, the <a href="http://www.azselfinsurers.org/">Arizona Self-Insurers Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.aiadc.org/aiapub/">American Insurance Association</a> [official websites]. The law was intended to balance the state's budget in part by transferring money from various special accounts, including $4.7 million from the ICA's Special Fund into the state's general fund.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Australia <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/australia-lodges-complaint-against-japan-whaling-in-icj.php">filed a complaint against Japan</a> [JURIST report] in the ICJ in May 2011 arguing that Japan's whaling practices in the Antarctic violate the <a href="http://www.unep.ch/regionalseas/legal/iwc.htm">International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</a> [materials]. New Zealand <a href="http://www.mccully.co.nz/">Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully</a> [official website] explained that New Zealand would intervene in the dispute between Australia and Japan because as a member of the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/">International Whaling Committee</a> (IWC) [official website], New Zealand is obligated to make sure that Japan complies with international law by not commercially killing whales:<blockquote>As a member of the International Whaling Commission, New Zealand has an interest in ensuring that the IWC works effectively and that the Whaling Convention is properly interpreted and applied. ... New Zealand has worked hard with Japan for over three years to try and find a permanent solution to whaling in the Southern Ocean. The government will continue to use all avenues possible to try to bring a halt to Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean.</blockquote>Australia and Japan have until December 21 to file responses to New Zealand's intervention.

<p>Japan's whaling program remains extremely controversial. Australia <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-brings-legal-action-to-end-japan-whaling-practice.php">initiated proceedings against Japan</a> [JURIST report] in May 2010. In July 2010 a Japanese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/japan-court-convicts-anti-whaling-activist-of-assault-obstruction.php">convicted</a> New Zealand anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune on charges of assault, trespass, destruction of property, illegal possession of a weapon and obstruction of business for <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/japan-authorities-indict-new-zealand.php">boarding a Japanese whaling vessel</a> [JURIST reports] as part of an anti-whaling protest in January of that year. Berthune, who called the charges "bogus," was extradited to New Zealand, and he will not serve prison time unless he returns to Japan. Commercial whaling has been banned by the International Whaling Commission since 1986.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The CAT, a panel composed of 10 human rights experts, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/11/23/un-panel-strongly-criticizes-russia-for-failing-to-investigate-widespread/">presented a report</a> [AP report] on Friday that laid out a set of criticisms against Russia and urged Russia to take immediate action to prevent torture. The criticisms in the report include accusations that Russia has increased its harassment and intimidation of journalists, tortured prisoners, and cracked down on freedom of speech and expression. The report also declared that Russia has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/11/2012112433720958246.html">failed to comply</a> [Al Jazeera report] with a 1987 treaty against torture and has denied many detainees access to legal counsel. The CAT has also called on Russia to prosecute individuals who have perpetrated torture and other human rights abuses.

<p>Russia has been cracking down on political dissent recently. On Tuesday Russia's new NGO law <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-activists-to-appeal-ngo-law-to-europe-rights-court.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report]. The new law requires NGOs that are financed from abroad to register as "foreign agents," a move that critics have said is an attempt to discredit NGOs. Three weeks ago Russia <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-internet-regulation-law-takes-effect.php">implemented a new Internet regulation law</a> [JURIST report] that gives the Russian government the ability to completely block access to certain websites. Earlier in November Russia's parliament passed a bill to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/russia-parliament-approves-bill-to-increase-treason-penalties.php">increase the penalties for treason</a> [JURIST report]. In October Russia freed one member of the controversial feminist rock collective <a href="http://www.rapsinews.com/judicial_analyst/20120820/264341551.html">Pussy Riot</a> [RASPI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pussy+riot+">news archive</a>] but <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/russia-court-frees-one-member-of-feminist-rock-band-upholds-sentence-for-2-others.php">upheld prison sentences for the two other band members</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Morsi has indicated that the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20488986">decree is temporary</a> [BBC report] and was not intended to focus power in the presidency. Morsi <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/25/us-egypt-president-idUSBRE8AM0DO20121125">plans to meet with judges</a> on Monday to discuss his plans following a weekend of widespread protests, including a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/24/us-egypt-president-judges-strike-idUSBRE8AN0AI20121124">threat by some judges to strike</a> [Reuters reports]. Morsi has stated that the goal of the decree was to move power into the hands of those elected by the people. He also plans to reopen trials for officials from the government of deposed president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>].  Twenty-two rights groups signed a <a href="http://www.anhri.net/en/?p=10270">statement</a> [text] condemning the decree and advocated for its immediate revocation.

<p>At the end of October, Egyptian Prosecutor-General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-prosecutor-orders-investigation-into-alleged-presidential-election-fraud.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations of forgery during the recent presidential elections. The order came after former Egyptian prime minister Ahmed Shafiq alleged that ballots were forged and votes were bought by Morsi. Shafiq is one of the many former politicians under Mubarak's regime who are facing corruption charges. In August the former secretary for Mubarak's political party, Safwat El-Sherif, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/former-mubarak-official-charged-with-corruption.php">referred to a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges. He was accused of having abused his office by obtaining real estate at discounted prices and illegally obtaining USD $49.2 million. In July an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-court-rejects-release-of-mubaraks-sons-until-trial-in-september.php">rejected pleas to release</a> [JURIST report] Mubarak's two sons while they await trial.

According to court documents, Apple seeks to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-25/samsung-s-galaxy-note-ii-infringes-patents-apple-says.html">supplement its claim</a> [Bloomberg report] with newer Samsung products brought to market after the original lawsuit was filed in February. These include the Galaxy SIII, Galaxy Note and several tablet and smart-phone designs that run on the Android Jelly Bean and Ice-Cream Sandwich operating systems. The motion elaborates: "Apple has acted quickly and diligently to determine that these newly released products do infringe many of the same claims already asserted by Apple, and in the same way that the already-accused devices infringe." Apple's request comes after a judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-allows-apple-samsung-to-add-products-to-patent-lawsuit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] earlier in November that each company would be allowed to pursue additional patent infringement claims against the other, including Samsung's claim that Apple's recently released iPhone 5 violates it patents. The lawsuit is one of two pending <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/lhk/applevsamsung">patent infringement cases</a> [case materials] between the companies and is currently scheduled for trial in 2014.

<p>Apple's motion is the most recent event in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans over four continents. Last month a judge for the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">issued a preliminary ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung infringed four of Apple's patents relating to smartphone design and touchscreen technology. In October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. Also in October, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/japan-reports-rejections-of-samsung-patent-infringement-claims-against-apple.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] patent infringement claims made by Samsung in Japan, overcoming Samsung's attempt to enjoin iPhone sales in the country. At the beginning of October, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product. Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bruins and an accomplice, who has since died, are accused of taking Dijkema, a prisoner at the time, to an isolated location and then shooting him four times. The suspects reported at the time that Dijkema had been trying to escape when they shot him. The case has been assigned to a separate court in Hagen to determine whether the case should proceed. Bruins, who obtained German citizenship through his service in the German military, has been taken into custody. Bruins has already served time in the 1980s for the murders of two Dutch Jews during the war. 

<p>Germany has recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-reopens-investigations-of-hundreds-of-former-nazi-death-camp-guards.php">reopened investigations</a> [JURIST report] and begun prosecuting Nazis for war crimes.

The 3-2 decision to overturn the convictions has <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_SERBIA_CROATIA_WAR_CRIMES_ROW">sparked outrage</a> [AP report] in Serbia where many view the tribunal as biased since Serbs comprise the majority of those convicted under the tribunal. While Serbia seeks the case file materials in order to consider bringing charges against the generals in Serbia, a retrial in Serbia or The Hague is unlikely absent compelling new evidence. 

<p>The two generals, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13035992">Ante Gotovina</a> [BBC backgrounder] and <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profiles/profile/473/action/show/controller/Profile.html">Mladen Markac</a> [Trial Watch backgrounder], were initially found <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icty-finds-croatia-military-leaders-guilty-of-war-crimes.php">guilty</a> [JURIST report] of crimes against humanity and war crimes for involvement in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4747379.stm">Operation Storm</a> [BBC backgrounder] during the Croatian war for independence. However, the five-judge appeals chamber <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/11145">ordered the immediate release</a> [ICTY press release] of the two generals after finding that the trial judge committed numerous errors and that the prosecutors failed to prove the existence of a criminal conspiracy. Croatia has welcomed the decision as validation of their claim that they were the victims in the Balkan wars and Gotovina and Markac are considered heroes in Croatia. However, the decision has jeopardized the dialogue between Croatian President <a href="http://predsjednik.hr/Default.aspx">Ivo Josipovic</a> and Serbian nationalist President <a href="http://www.predsednik.rs/node/10">Tomislav Nikolic</a> [official websites] as the two sides seek to reconcile.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The OBS, a joint program of the <a href="http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation for Human Rights</a> (FIDH) and the <a href="http://www.omct.org/">World Organisation Against Torture</a> [advocacy websites], published the 31-page report entitled "Zimbabwe: Ongoing risks for human rights defenders in the context of political deadlock and pre-electoral period." The report stated that "a climate of impunity still prevails" among Zimbabwean authorities:<blockquote>Zimbabwean authorities have continued to resort to pieces of legislation to selectively and systematically restrict the space for the enjoyment of freedoms of expression, association and assembly of human rights defenders, and to encourage and condone serious violations of their rights, including arbitrary arrests and detentions or acts of torture.</blockquote>With the upcoming referendum for a new Zimbabwean Constitution, slated for the end of 2012, and the approaching March 2013 general elections, the OBS fears that human rights defenders will be threatened with a potential rise in violence due to the collusion between security forces and the current presidential party. The OBS submitted many recommendations for reform to Zimbabwean authorities. Among these were the requests that the government guarantee in all circumstances "the physical and psychological integrity of all human rights defenders in Zimbabwe" along with "the freedoms of opinion and expression." 

<p>Zimbabwe has encountered similar human rights issues in the past. In March various human rights groups urged South African courts to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/rights-group-urges-south-africa-to-prosecute-zimbabwe-crimes-against-humanity.php">prosecute</a> Zimbabwe for <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/torture-rights-violations-occurring-in-zimbabwe-diamond-mines-bbc.php">violations including torture and forced labor</a> [JURIST reports] of civilian workers in illegal mining camps. In June 2009 <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/zimbabwe-amnesty-international-secretary-general-concludes-visit-2009061">report</a> [press release] stating that Zimbabwe was still experiencing <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/zimbabwe-government-urged-to-address.php">serious human rights violations</a>, [JURIST report], such as the arrest and detention of human rights activists, and needed to confront issues that led to such problems. </p>]]></content:encoded>

"The right to education means more than just being able to attend school," Singh said. Singh also emphasized the increasing importance of educational quality in technical and vocational education and training in a quality perspective of education. These comments were made in Paris following the first <a href=" http://www.campaignforeducation.org/en/">Global Education for All</a> [official website] meeting led by the <a href=" http://www.unesco.org/new/en/">UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> [official website]. Education for All aims to bring educational benefits to every citizen in every society and has provided a framework of specific goals for governments to accelerate progress for meeting educational goals by 2015.

<p>These statements are part of a global call for the elimination of discrimination in educational settings. In September the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-expert-calls-for-greater-integration-of-bosnia-and-herzgovina-minorities.php">urged Bosnia and Herzgovina</a> [JURIST report] to do more to promote the education of minorities within the country. Also in September the Human Rights Watch commented on the <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/iran-should-reverse-policies-impairing-equal-access-to-education-hrw.php">lack of academic freedom</a> [JURIST report] for many students, particularly women, in Iraq. In April Amnesty International challenged European governments to do more to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/muslims-discriminated-against-for-religious-dress-ai.php">address discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against Muslims in educational settings. Last December the UN also spoke against <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-report-details-global-violence-against-lgbt-individuals.php">discrimination of LGBT individuals</a> [JURIST report] in educational settings.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the OTP's <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/C433C462-7C4E-4358-8A72-8D99FD00E8CD/285209/OTP2012ReportonPreliminaryExaminations22Nov2012.pdf">2012 Report on Preliminary Examination Activities</a> [text, PDF], there is a reasonable basis to conclude that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13809501">Boko Haram</a> [BBC backgrounder], an Islamist militant group that endeavors to create an Islamic state, has violated several provisions under Article 7 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] since launching a widespread attack in July 2009 that has resulted in the killing of more than 1,200 Christian and Muslim civilians throughout Nigeria. In particular, Boko Haram has allegedly committed crimes of against humanity under Article 7's provisions related to murder and persecution. The Prosecutor also found that the attacks have been committed pursuant to the policies of Boko Haram leadership, which seeks to impose an exclusive Islamic government at the expense of Christians. Given the findings, the OTP has advanced the preliminary examination of the situation in Nigeria to phase 3, which entails an assessment of whether Nigerian authorities are conducting genuine proceedings as a result of the alleged crimes. The report also noted that there was no reasonable basis to conclude that Niger Delta militants and Nigerian government security forces had also committed crimes against humanity in Nigeria, as <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/hrw-nigeria-islamist-group-government-forces-committing-rights-abuses.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] last month.

<p>Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government and create an Islamic state and has warned Christians in the mostly Muslim northern regions to leave the area. The group has publicly claimed responsibility for several attacks, including <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i4Vpsk9pJxwfvsGVSauUtxhi9puw?docId=CNG.08bf367b8562759d55ef1851220362a0.01">church bombings</a> [AFP report] on December 25 that killed approximately 40 people last year. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged Nigerian leaders from all sectors of society to make a concerted effort to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-chief-urges-nigeria-leaders-to-halt-sectarian-violence.php">stop the sectarian violence</a> [JURIST report]. The Christmas day bombings were internationally condemned, including being labeled as "senseless violence" <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hszpsUj4H-ZIDATQOfucRH3cE9Sw?docId=CNG.0298b6868ea65fcc526217c01cda8091.51">by the White House</a> and acts of "blind hatred" <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iA9WMF_7QCzqrwUlDU08lTCXfM_Q?docId=CNG.08bf367b8562759d55ef1851220362a0.8c1">by the Vatican</a> [AFP reports]. Additionally, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] has previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-office-concerned-over-renewed-violence-in-nigeria.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over acts of ethnic violence by Boko Haram. Specifically, the Office described the group's <a href="http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/boko-haram-claims-nigeria-attack-128490388/130980.html">bombing of a UN building in Nigeria</a> [VOA report] in August 2011 as "cowardly."

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-556.pdf">Vance v. Ball State University</a> [transcript, PDF] the court considered whether an employer can be held <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/vicarious_liability">vicariously liable</a> [LII backgrounder] for harassment by supervisors who oversee the daily work of the alleged victim, and if that potential liability is limited to those having firing and hiring power. In <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15103611360542350644&q=Faragher+v.+City+of+Boca+Raton&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</a> and <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2707173104214869053&q=Burlington+Industries,+Inc.+v.+Ellerth&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</a> [opinions] the Supreme Court held that under <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> [text], an employer is vicariously liable for severe or pervasive workplace harassment by a supervisor of the victim. The petitioner argued that the rules resulting out of these cases, interpreted throughout the circuit courts, has been applied inconsistently and haphazardly:<blockquote>The judges in the Seventh Circuit itself have recognized that the rule does not really well fit the realities of the workplace. It also just moves uncertainty from one category to another. The category of supervisor may be a little bit tidier; but, under the Seventh Circuit's approach, the category of co-worker is very unpredictable. The Seventh Circuit itself, in <span class = "casename">Doe v. Oberweis Dairy</span>, recognized that once you move people who can take&#8212;have this kind of power over their victims but can't actually take annual employment actions against them into the category of co-workers, all of a sudden you have to apply a sliding scale of negligence. Not only that, but the jury is the one who applies it. So for those categories&#8212;this exact category of employee, Your Honor, the employer going forward has very little idea of whether&#8212;what standard of care is that a particular jury would apply in that case and whether the jury would decide it is met or not.</blockquote>The respondents argued for the Supreme Court not to consider changing the rule but to find for its client on the merits.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1160.pdf">FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF] on state government's expressions of anti-compete statements under Federal antitrust law. In the case, the state of Georgia allowed a local government outlet, <a href = "http://www.phoebeputney.com/">Phoebe Putney Health System</a> [corporate website], to lease hospitals for the state, and then the hospitals bought out the competition, creating a monopoly. The court is considering whether Phoebe should be open to antitrust suits as a state actor and if it properly employed the <a href = "http://www.antitrustinstitute.org/content/state-action-doctrine">state action doctrine</a> [ABA backgrounder] as a defense. Essentially, the court is considering if Georgia has allowed Phoebe Putney Health System to act improperly as a state actor. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) argued that Georgia, in not being clear enough about it's anti-competition platform, was open to suit.<blockquote>And a power to grant proper&#8212;excuse me&#8212;a power to acquire properties, generally speaking, unadorned with any particular expression from the state about how&#8212;how that power is to be used, is something that can be used competitively or anticompetitively, and you can't infer from that that the state really has an objective of, as I say, such as socializing its hospital services because&#8212;and&#8212;and that clarity of expression from the state is really important here, for several reasons.</blockquote>The attorney for Phoebe argued that the company was simply fulfilling a mandate to provide for indigents. "These special purpose authorities do not simply have general corporate powers. They have a mandate. There is a Georgia constitutional amendment that coincided with the enactment of the Hospital Authorities Law that derogated the State's duty to provide indigent care to its&#8212;hospital care to its citizens."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Geithner</a> [docket; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">report</a>] to the <a href = "http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website]. The court ordered the lower court to re-consider the case in light of <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [JURIST report]. The Fourth Circuit previously <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/fourth-circuit-rejects-virginia-health-care-law-challenge.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] the suit as untimely. The suit's original <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Petition-Certiorari.pdf">petition for <em>certiorari</em></a> [text, PDF] questioned whether the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [HR 3590 text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] could force the insurance mandate on both employers and citizens.

<p>The court denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1515.htm">Delling v. Idaho</a> [docket; SCOTUSblog <a href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/delling-v-idaho/">backgrounder</a>] over the dissent of three justices. The case would have reviewed whether the ability to raise a defense of insanity in a criminal case is mandated by the Constitution. Justice Stephen Breyer, in dissent, argued that the issue needed to be decided in consideration of Idaho's policies on the issue:<blockquote>To illustrate with a very much simplified example: Idaho law would distinguish the following two cases. Case One: The defendant, due to insanity, believes that the victim is a wolf. He shoots and kills the victim. Case Two: The defendant, due to insanity, believes that a wolf, a supernatural figure, has ordered him to kill the victim. In Case One, the defendant does not know he has killed a human being, and his insanity negates a mental element necessary to commit the crime. In Case Two, the defendant has intentionally killed a victim whom he knows is a human being; he possesses the necessary <em>mens rea</em>. In both cases the defendant is unable, due to insanity, to appreciate the true quality of his act, and therefore unable to perceive that it is wrong. But in Idaho, the defendant in Case One could defend the charge by arguing that he lacked the <em>mens rea</em>, whereas the defendant in Case Two would not be able to raise a defense based on his mental illness. Much the same outcome seems likely to occur in other States that have modified the insanity defense in similar ways.</blockquote>Breyer was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>

<p>The Court also released a <em>per curiam</em> <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-1377_3e04.pdf">summary judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-1377.htm">Nitro-Lift Technologies, LLC v. Howard</a> [docket] that the Oklahoma Supreme Court had erred by not following the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9">Federal Arbitration Act</a> [text]. "By declaring the noncompetition agreements in two employment contracts null and void, rather than leaving that determination to the arbitrator in the first instance, the state court ignored a basic tenet of the Act's substantive arbitration law."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pursuant to the law, referendums can be used to approve altering the wording of the constitution, to amend the constitution and to repeal a law amending the constitution. They can also be used to resolve territorial issues of Ukraine. Opposition parties have <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/yanukovych-signs-law-on-national-referendums-316772.html">vowed to challenge</a> [<em>Kyiv Post</em> report] the law's validity in the Constitutional Court. They fear the law will be used to alter the Constitution in a manner that will allow deputies of the Verkhovna Rada, not the people of Ukraine, to elect Ukraine's president. The law was <a href="http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/uk/publish/article/news_left?art_id=322023&cat_id=37486">approved</a> [press release, in Ukrainian] by Ukraine's parliament on November 6, with 265 deputies <a href="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/radac_gs09/g_frack_list_n?ident=30849&krit=66">voting</a> [results, in Ukrainian] for the bill and 15 against. 

<p>Earlier this month, a Ukrainian Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ukraine-court-again-postpones-tymoshenko-tax-evasion-trial.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a motion to suspend the tax evasion trial against former Ukrainian prime minister <a href="http://www.tymoshenko.ua/">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Tymoshenko">news archive</a>] until her health is recovered, but adjourned the trial since Tymoshenko could not attend. In September the US <a href="http://www.foreign.senate.gov">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-senate-panel-urges-release-of-ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">unanimously passed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.RES.466:">resolution</a> [text] calling for Ukraine to release Tymoshenko from prison. In August the <a href="http://www.scourt.gov.ua/">Ukrainian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Ukrainian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-high-court-denies-ex-pm-tymoshenkos-appeal.php">upheld Tymoshenko's abuse of office conviction</a> [JURIST report]. During the appeal the government denied allegations that the criminal proceedings against Tymoshenko were a measure initiated by Yanukovich to prevent her from participating in the October parliamentary elections. The decision came only a day after the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/europe-rights-court-hears-tymoshenko-appeal.php">held a hearing</a> [JURIST report] on Tymoshenko's appeal. Also in August Ukrainian prosecutors urged the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/ukraine-prosecutors-urge-court-not-to-hear-tymoshenko-appeal.php">not to hear her appeal</a> [JURIST report]. Prosecutors told the court that Tymoshenko's trial had already established her guilt in the case, and asked the judges maintain her <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-sentenced-to-7-years.php">seven-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] in the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontpakistan.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Pakistani judges on Tuesday to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/11/27/pakistan-judges-muzzling-critics-media">stop using contempt of court powers</a> [press release] as a mechanism for silencing the media's critique of the judiciary. Since 2009 when the independent judiciary was restored, Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and the provincial high courts have reportedly attempted to muzzle the media's criticism of the judiciary by threatening to use contempt of court proceedings, which could mean a prison sentence for journalists. Brad Adams, Asia director at HRW, said that the judiciary is not immune from criticism and should not be abusing their power to coerce and censor the media by curbing their freedom of expression. The judiciary was criticized when Malik Riaz, a real estate tycoon, publicly accused Arsalan Iftikhar, the son of Chief Justice Chaudhry, of threatening prosecution in order to extort millions of dollars from him. Further controversy ensued when the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/pakistan-court-disqualifies-prime-minister.php">disqualified</a> [JURIST report] Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani from office based on his refusal to bring criminal charges against the country's president. According to HRW: <blockquote>Journalists have told Human Rights Watch that major television stations and newspapers were informally advised by judicial authorities that they would be summoned to face contempt of court charges for criticizing or commenting unfavorably on judicial decisions or specific judges. In 2010 editors and former editors of several publications, including the English-language newspaper Dawn, faced contempt proceedings for publishing a story alleging misuse of office by the Sindh High Court chief justice, which was averted after their papers apologized publicly to the court.</blockquote>Pakistan's courts have been the subject of ongoing criticism for judicial overreach. 

<p>Last week, A Pakistani court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/pakistan-court-drops-blasphemy-charges-against-christian-girl.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] police to drop blasphemy charges against a 14-year-old girl, which had sparked international concern over the use of the country's controversial law. The girl was charged under Pakistan's blasphemy law for allegedly burning pages for a Koran. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court of Pakistan <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/pakistan-high-court-retracts-pms-contempt-charge.php">retracted</a> [JURIST report] a contempt of court charge filed against Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf after approving notification of his compliance with a June directive that ordered the revival of corruption charges against President Asif Ali Zardari. Tensions between the country's judiciary and executive branch remain strong amidst the government's near year-long refusal to follow the high court's order to probe corruption allegations against the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit follows a disagreement between the two companies for the renewal of licenses for telecommunications patents. The negotiation lasted for nearly two years after which Samsung ultimately refused to agree to sign the license agreement on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Ericsson claimed that legal measures are unavoidable given the lack of mutual agreement despite its honest efforts "to amicably come to an agreement with Samsung and to sign a license agreement on FRAND terms." On the other hand, Samsung alleged that Ericsson demanded excessively high royalty rates for the renewal of the license agreement. Samsung had entered into a license agreement with Ericsson in 2001 which was renewed in 2007. 

<p>Samsung has been involved in numerous patent infringement lawsuits, especially with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website]. Earlier this month, a judge for the US <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] ruled that Apple and Samsung may each pursue additional patent infringement claims against the other, allowing each company to add devices brought to market after the original lawsuit was filed in February. In October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month, a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. In the same time frame Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a Tokyo District Court ruling which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of October, the US <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product. Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referral arose from a claim made by a member of Irish Parliament that the ESM, an amendment to the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0047:0200:en:PDF">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU) [text, PDF], entails an alteration of the competences of the EU. Specifically, the ESM is inconsistent with provisions of the EU's founding treaties, such as the TFEU, concerning economic and monetary union and general principles of EU law. The ECJ held that the ESM does not encroach on the exclusive competence held by the EU in neither the area of monetary nor economic policies for euro zone Member States. The court stated, "[i]t is not the purpose of the ESM to maintain price stability, but rather to meet the financing requirements of ESM Members ... [and] to safeguard the stability of the euro as a whole." The court went on to say that since the provisions of the TFEU do not confer any specific power on the EU to establish a stability mechanism, the member states are entitled to conclude an agreement between themselves for the establishment of such a mechanism. Approval from the EU's high court now paves the way for full implementation when the amendment takes effect on January 1, 2013. 

<p>In March 2011, the European Council adopted the ESM as an amendment to the TFEU. In February, the member states approved the establishment of the ESM, giving it full legal personality. Since its adoption, the ESM has come under legal scrutiny throughout the euro zone. Like in Ireland, critics of the amendment in Germany wanted the measure to be subject to a referendum. In September, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/germany-constitutional-court-supports-caps-eurozone-funding.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a preliminary injunction to halt the implementation of the ESM's 500 billion euro fund, stating that the parliament did not unconstitutionally impair its own ability to adopt and control the nation's budget. However, the court did impose a cap on Germany's contribution to the fund. In July the court had <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/germany-finance-minister-defends-fiscal-pacts.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] over a claim brought in opposition to the ESM. In June the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the German Bundestag has the right to be heard on the European financial crisis, holding in a case initiated by the Green party that Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to notify the parliament early enough about plans for the ESM regarding its sister party in Austria. Although that decision did not have any effect on the 500 billion euro ESM, it increased the parliament's rights by requiring the chancellor's government to provide notice to the parliament as early as possible in the future. A previous ruling that gave the parliament similar rights over matter concerning the EU was issued in February. The country's constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/germany-high-court-rules-europe-stimulus-procedure-unconstitutional.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the use of a parliamentary subcommittee to fast-track decisions related to eurozone bailouts is unconstitutional. Rather, it required the entire Bundestag to overview such decisions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The committee's resolution calls on the UN's 193 member countries to enact and enforce legislation to protect women and girls from female circumcision and other genital mutilation procedures and to end impunity for violators. The resolution recognized "that female genital mutilations were an irreparable, irreversible abuse of the human rights of woman and girls, as well as a threat to their health." The resolution would also designate February 6 as the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation. The resolution will be <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501363_162-57555359/un-committee-calls-for-ban-on-female-circumcision/">considered</a> [AP report] by the wider UN General Assembly in December, and with the support of 110 sponsors, approval of the resolution is expected.

<p>As many as 140 million women and girls worldwide have undergone some form of FGM, which is defined by the <a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) [official website] as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons." In February the UN released its annual report on trends in FGM, revealing that approximately 2,000 African communities have <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-reports-progress-in-ending-female-genital-mutilation.php">renounced the practice</a> [JURIST report] since last year. In 2010 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rights-group-urges-iraqi-kurdistan-to-end-female-genital-mutilation.php">called on the government of Iraqi Kurdistan</a> [JURIST report] to outlaw FGM and to develop a comprehensive legislative plan to reduce the practice in the region. In 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/uganda-parliament-outlaws-female.php">Uganda unanimously outlawed FGM</a> [JURIST report] and imposed harsh penalties on anyone who conducts the procedure. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Her mission was to examine El Salvador's progress at implementing and fulfilling its human rights obligations regarding the independence of judges and lawyers and those obstacles that inhibit the proper functioning of those positions. Knaul pointed to the example of El Salvador's <a href="http://www.csj.gob.sv/salaconstitucional.html">Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice's</a> decision declaring recent Supreme Court magisterial appointments by the <a href="http://www.asamblea.gob.sv/">Legislative Assembly</a> [official websites, in Spanish] unconstitutional, which undermined both judicial independence and separation of powers. Knaul encouraged El Salvador to engage in judicial reform, recommending that El Salvador's institutions respect and implement the decisions of the national courts and the courts' interpretations of El Salvador's <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/ElSalvador1983English.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. She called on the Legislative Assembly to ensure that magisterial appointments are based solely on qualifications and to agree on the election requirements for the Attorney-General. Knaul encouraged the protection of judicial impartiality by de-politicizing the justice system. She stated that:<blockquote>Judicial independence has a crucial role to play in upholding the rule of law, combating impunity and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms at all times. Its implementation requires the creation of an environment conducive to independent, impartial and fair decision-making that enable judges and magistrates to decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason. ... It is therefore of extreme importance that the judicial system be free from political or any other pressure.</blockquote>Knaul will <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12840&LangID=E">present a comprehensive report</a> [press release] to the UN Human Rights Council in June 2013.

<p>Knaul has criticized El Salvador's judicial independence record in the past. In 2011 she <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-expert-warns-new-el-salvador-law-harms-judicial-independence.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that an El Salvador law requiring its high court to issue unanimous judgments was an "attack" on judicial independence and the separation of powers and harmed the judges' ability to function effectively. The law was controversial in El Salvador, with civic organizations pushing for its repeal. In 2008 hundreds of judges and lawyers in El Salvador <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/el-salvador-judges-protest-judicial.php">marched to the Supreme Court of Justice</a> [JURIST report] to protest challenges that the attorney general made to the rulings of four judges. Then-Attorney General Felix Safie had asked the Supreme Court to investigate the judges' decisions, calling those decisions arbitrary exercises of power and accusing the judges of corruption. The judges claimed that they acted according to the law and that the government sought to encroach on their independence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

McCutchen</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-takes-10-more-cases-for-2012-term.php">report</a>] on the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-18">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [materials]. The court is considering whether &#167; 502(a)(3) of ERISA is susceptible to equitable principles of relief even where the plan's terms give it an absolute right to full reimbursement. An attorney for US Airways argued that ERISA allows fiduciaries of the plan to seek appropriate equitable relief and that the agreement plan signed by all parties, regardless of what it says, controls and is appropriate. The respondents argued that <a href = "http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/subrogation">subrogation</a> [backgrounder] agreements made for claims involved in the plan must be considered separate of the plan and ahead of it. "Reimbursement claims that are based on an express subrogation agreement are subject to equitable principles of subrogation. In equity, these claims were governed, according to the same principles that governed every other type of subrogation."

<p>The <a href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=155587">case</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] concerns a former employee of US Airways, James McCutchen, who was injured in a car accident. McCutchen, as an employee, had a self-funded health plan that ended up paying out approximately $66,000 for his injuries. Through insurance payouts and a settlement from the negligent driver, even with a hefty attorney's fee levied against him, McCutchen ended up approximately $66,000 ahead. US Airways then demanded reimbursement of its health plan's payout, since McCutchen's medical care was covered by other insurance options, based on language in the plan itself. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in defiance of several other circuits <a href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/US_Airways_Inc_v_McCutchen_663_F3d_671_52_EBC_2143_3d_Cir_2011_Co">held</a> [opinion] that "appropriate equitable relief" did not include revoking the payment to McCutchen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed reform seeks to alter the scope of Colombia's military criminal justice system. Should the proposal be adopted, the investigations and trials of military personnel suspected of war crimes and arbitrary detention will fall under the the scope of the military justice system. Spokesperson Cecile Pouilly claims this will "seriously undermine previous efforts undertaken by the Colombian Government to ensure that human rights violations, allegedly committed by members of the Colombian military and police forces, are duly investigated and perpetrators held to account." While she admits the proposal specifically excludes "crimes against humanity and most gross human rights violations", the fact that the military will be responsible for determining the specific crimes is another concern. Pouilly further emphasized the Colombian government should reconsider the reform in the interest of preserving accountability for military personel who commit human rights abuses.

<p>Colombia has drawn attention from UN rights bodies several times recently. In October UN experts <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-experts-urge-colombia-to-reconsider-constitutional-reform-of-military-criminal-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Colombia to reconsider this constitutional reform.

Last December the representative to Colombia for the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-representative-calls-for-peace-in-colombia.php">called for a peaceful solution</a> [JURIST report] to the country's ongoing armed conflict involving hostages held by paramilitary rebels.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to these highest appeals courts, the lower appeals courts have resolved to <a href="http://www.brandonsun.com/world/breaking-news/egypt-state-tv-highest-appeal-court-suspends-work-nationwide-to-protest-presidents-decrees-181166781.html?thx=y">suspend work</a> [AP report] as well. The nation's Supreme Constitutional Court also announced its discontent with Morsi's decree on Wednesday, calling the move an <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-egypt-constitutional-courtbre8ar0bv-20121128,0,1593594.story">attack on the judiciary</a> [Reuters report]. Morsi's decree extends protection from judicial review to the lower chamber of parliament and to a panel charged with drafting the nation's new constitution. These legislators are largely composed of <a href="http://www.ikhwanonline.com/new/Default.aspx">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [party website, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">news archive</a>] members and Islamists.

<p>Tension between Egypt's judiciary and the administration has persisted despite the overthrow of former president Hosni Mubarak last year. Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-to-meet-with-judges-after-vast-power-expansion.php">agreed to meet with the judges</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week to discuss the decree. In August a lawyer in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-lawyer-challenges-morsi-declaration.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging a declaration by Morsi granting himself <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">complete legislative and executive power</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in</a>, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the country's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] dissolving parliament after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports].

Arizona is asking the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to <a href="http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2012/11/27/arizona-appeals-ruling-on-planned-parenthood/">lift the injunction</a> [AP report] to ensure that no public funding is used to finance abortion. However, the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] granted the injunction because that the bill harms women who rely on Planned Parenthood facilities for care that doesn't include abortions.

<p>Arizona is currently facing multiple lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of recently passed abortion restrictions. The district court injunction was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-arizona-law-to-defund-planned-parenthood.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] in October. In September, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-enjoins-arizona-abortion-law.php">issued an emergency injunction</a> against an Arizona law that prohibits abortions after 20 weeks into a pregnancy except for in medical emergencies, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-challenge-arizona-abortion-law.php">challenged</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> and the <a href="http://acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona</a> [advocacy websites] in July. The law restricting funding to abortion clinics was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/05/us-usa-abortion-arizona-idUSBRE84402Y20120505">signed by Governor Jan Brewer in May</a> [Reuters report], while the law banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy was <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/arizona-governor-signs-bill-to-ban-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed in April</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The original challenge was brought by advocacy groups, including the <a href="http://www.hispanicinterest.org/">Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama</a> (HICA) [advocacy website], and individual plaintiffs. The court did not provide any reasons for denying the rehearing <em>en banc</em>. The federal government previously challenged the Alabama immigration law, and Alabama state officials <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/news/news_detail.aspx?ID=7010">petitioned</a> [press release] the appeals court in September to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/alabama-asks-federal-appeals-to-reconsider-immigration-law.php">reconsider its ruling</a> [JURIST report] after a three-judge panel rejected provisions making it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work or solicit work, imposing criminal penalties on persons who rent property to illegal immigrants and requiring state officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-denies-alabama-request-to-reconsider-immigration-law.php">denied the state's request</a> [JURIST report] to rehear the government's challenge of the law in October. The court ultimately <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/201114535.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] several provisions, including one allowing police officers to check the immigration status of persons suspected of a crime. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has became a hot button issue over the past few years as many states have passed laws giving state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. Earlier this month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/index.asp">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-upholds-motorist-provision-of-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] part of South Carolina's controversial <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/20.htm">immigration law</a> [SB 20, materials] that permits law enforcement officials to detain motorists on the side of the road for a "reasonable amount of time" while the officer checks the driver's immigration status. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in September denied a request for a new injunction against a controversial provision of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070, PDF] which requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In August the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on two anti-illegal immigrant laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdod.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Four female service members <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/heger-et-al-vs-panetta.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF] Tuesday against the US <a href="http://www.army.mil/">Army</a> and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official websites] to end a policy which bars women from combat units and related posts. The suit, filed in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], was also joined by the <a href="http://servicewomen.org/">Service Women's Action Network</a> (SWAN) [advocacy website] as plaintiffs. The women claim a 1994 combat exclusion policy which denies women access to any position "below the brigade level whose primary mission is to engage in direct combat on the ground," has limited the potential of women's careers and is a violation of the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. According to the suit:<blockquote>Of the women who have been deployed since September 11, 2001, 85 percent reported serving in a combat zone or in an area where they drew imminent danger pay or hostile fire pay, and nearly half reported being involved in combat operations. Many of those women have served in combat with distinction. But they have been deprived of the training, opportunities, and recognition they deserve because, under the combat exclusion policy, they cannot "officially" be assigned to ground combat units.</blockquote>The women believe a court order banning the policy excluding women from combat roles will increase recruitment, field safety and general equality.

<p>This is the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/female-officers-sue-us-government-over-ban-on-women-in-combat.php">second suit</a> [JURIST report] brought this year by female service members challenging the combat exclusion policy. Last year a US military panel, the Military Leadership Diversity Commission, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/military-commission-recommends-allowing-women-to-serve-in-direct-military-combat.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that women be allowed to serve on the front lines of combat. Their report said that integration of women into combat forces would have no ill effects and recommended a "time-phased" approach to the implementation of new combat policies that would create additional career options for women that include "direct ground combat." These recent suits to allow women into combat roles come on the heels of another civil rights push in military policy-last year's repeal of the controversial <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">"Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>]. Last year Australia became the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/australia-military-to-allow-women-in-combat-roles.php">fourth nation</a> [JURIST report] which permitted women to serve in combat roles.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/Ferguson_v._JONAH_-_Complaint.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF], the first of its kind in the US, alleges that <a href="http://www.jonahweb.org/index.php">Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing</a> (JONAH) [official website], a non-profit organization that "works with those struggling with unwanted same-sex sexual attractions," has defrauded those who have employed their services. The claim was brought under New Jersey's <a href="http://www.nj.gov/oag/ca/laws/CFAlaws.pdf">Consumer Fraud Act</a> [text, PDF] which protects people from "unconscionable commercial practice." Lawyers for the <a href="">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) [advocacy website] have joined the men to support their action against conversion therapy and issued a <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splc-files-groundbreaking-lawsuit-accusing-conversion-therapy-organization-of-frau">statement</a> [press release] which includes quotes from the <a href="http://www.apa.org/">American Psychological Association</a> (APA) [official website] that claims that conversion therapy can "create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish."

<p>The practice of conversion therapy has come under scrutiny lately. Last month California became the first state to enact a law <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">banning conversion therapy</a> [JURIST report]. That <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1172_bill_20120416_amended_sen_v97.html">bill</a> [SB 1172; Senate <a href="http://sd28.senate.ca.gov/sites/sd28.senate.ca.gov/files/SB%201172%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">backgrounder</a>, PDF] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">approved by the California State Assembly</a> at the end of August and by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST reports] in May. Supporters of the bill asserted that the underlying reason for the legislation is that homosexuality is not a disease and that therapies to reverse homosexuality were found to have detrimental effects on minors' physical and mental health, leading to suicides and substance abuse. Conversely, groups such as the <a href="http://narth.com/">National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality</a> (NARTH) [advocacy website] voiced their opposition, arguing that most of the facts relied on in the bill are generalizations and loose assertions. According to some experts, California's efforts to pass the ban on sexual orientation therapy have highlighted a <a href="/forum/2012/09/mary-ziegler-gender-standards.php">need for better gender identity standards</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief from a New York handgun law requiring licensing officials to have applicants prove "proper cause" to obtain licenses to carry handguns for self-defense. The plaintiffs, citing the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>], contended that the Second Amendment guarantees them a right to possess and carry weapons in public to defend themselves from dangerous confrontation, and that New York cannot constitutionally require them to demonstrate proper cause to exercise that right. The appeals court upheld the New York law, holding that <span class="casename">Heller</span> only addressed carrying handguns inside the home and left the issue of carrying guns outside the home unanswered. In their opinion the judges stated, "New York determined that limiting handgun possession to persons who have an articulable basis for believing they will need the weapon for self-defense is in the best interest of public safety and outweighs the need to have a handgun for an unexpected confrontation."

<p>A number of Second Amendment guns control cases have been percolating in the courts throughout the country. In July the state of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/florida-to-appeal-federal-court-ruling-striking-down-state-gun-law.php">stated that it would appeal</a> the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] ruling that <a href="http://www.postonpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Docket-105-2012.06.29-Order-on-Cross-Motions-for-SJ.pdf">struck down</a> [order, PDF] a Florida law barring doctors from discussing the dangers of gun ownership with patients. In March the <a href="http://www.mdd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Maryland</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-rules-maryland-gun-law-found-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Maryland law which limited individuals' rights to obtaining a permit by requiring a "good and substantial reason" was unconstitutional. In June 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1521.ZO.html">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government, thereby overturning Chicago's ban on handguns and raising considerable uncertainty about what amount of regulations of firearms was permissible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed suit against the company in 1999 alleging violations of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a> (RICO) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The court held in 2004 that Philip Morris had "knowingly and intentionally" conspired to defraud smokers and potential smokers "for purposes of financial gain ... [by] repeatedly, consistently, vigorously" and falsely denying adverse health effects and addictive qualities in public despite the company's own "massive" collection of scientific research confirming otherwise. After the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] affirmed in 2009, Judge Gladys Kessler on Tuesday required that the company must issue approved corrective statements to be published in newspapers and disseminated through television advertisements, retail displays and corporate websites. The order includes statements such as: "Here is the truth: Smoking kills, on average, 1200 Americans. Every day" and "[m]ore people die every year from smoking than from murder, AIDS, suicide, drugs, car crashes, and alcohol, combined." Kessler also recommended that the parties meet with a Special Master to reach an agreement regarding this issue by March 1, 2013.

<p>Tobacco labeling and advertising have been litigated for years. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in August that tobacco companies <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">do not need to print graphic warnings</a> [JURIST report] of the dangers of smoking on cigarette packages. In a 2-1 decision, the DC Circuit struck down a Food and Drug Administration regulation that requires tobacco companies to display graphic images such as a man smoking a cigarette through a hole in his throat. Also in August, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/new-hampshire-supreme-court-revokes-class-action-status-in-cigarette-lawsuit.php">revoked class action status</a> [JURIST Report] in a lawsuit challenging the labeling of "light" cigarettes. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-appeals-court-blocks-law-requiring-graphic-tobacco-warnings-in-stores.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a New York City Department of Health regulation requiring stores to display graphic anti-tobacco ads where tobacco products are sold.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The move came after a Swedish arbitrator's decision that ruled in favor of the Finnish company in a breach of contract case. Nokia is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/28/us-nokia-rim-idUSBRE8AR08320121128">seeking to enforce</a> [Reuters report] the decision. The arbitrator held that the Canadian company, which uses Nokia's wireless local access network (WLAN) technologies in its BlackBerry smartphones, is obligated to pay royalties if it desires to continue to utilize the technologies at issue. Nokia and RIM entered into a license agreement covering cellular patents in 2003, but in 2011 RIM unsuccessfully sought to extend the license to WLAN patents in the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. Specific dates of when the courts will hear the cases are still unknown.

<p>Litigation involving smartphone technologies have become more common throughout the globe. The most significant example is the battle between <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate websites]. Earlier this month, a judge for the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] ruled that Apple and Samsung may each pursue additional patent infringement claims against the other, allowing each company to add devices brought to market after the original lawsuit was filed in February. In October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month, a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. In the same time frame Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a Tokyo District Court ruling which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of October, the US <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product. Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The letter, signed by the <a href="http://www.epic.org">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) and the <a href="http://www.democraticmedia.org/">Center for Digital Democracy</a> (CDD) [advocacy websites], noted that some of the changes directly affected the company's privacy policy, and that the changes "raise privacy risks for users, may be contrary to law, and violate your previous commitments to users about site governance."  The groups expressed their concerns over Facebook's plan to discontinue its user-voting method for site-wide policy changes, a system enacted in response to privacy complaints filed by EPIC in 2009. The letter also discussed Facebook's plan to share user data between various business entities, claiming that such a move may violate a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ftc-and-facebook-settle-privacy-dispute.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] last year with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website]. The proposal discussed in the letter was released on the evening before a long holiday weekend in the United States.

<p>Privacy concerns remain a significant as websites grow in complexity, and the data about individual users they possess becomes more interconnected. In August German data privacy authorities <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/germany-reopens-privacy-investigation-into-facebook-facial-recognition-software.php">reopened</a> [JURIST report] an investigation into facial recognition software used by Facebook that automatically recognizes facial features in pictures.

United States</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-takes-10-more-cases-for-2012-term.php">report</a>] on appellate review for plain error. The question before the court was whether, under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_52">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b)</a> [text], an appellate court reviewing a trial court decision for "plain error," when a matter of law was unsettled at the time of trial but is settled by the time of appeal, should consider what the law was at the time of trial or at the time of appeal. As of now, the First, Second, Sixth, Tenth and Eleventh Circuits apply the law at the time of appeal, but the Ninth Circuit uses the law at the time of trial. Henderson's attorney argued that the interest in preventing clear errors and allowing justice supports the idea that the time-of-appeal rule should prevail so that defendants will not be treated under a rule that has been ruled unconstitutional or wrong for other reasons. Attorneys for the US government, however, argued that the interest in promoting objections at the time of trial and avoiding reversal of trial court decisions that were, at the time they were made, reasonable under the circumstances, even if they were later proven to be wrong by a higher court, supports the idea that the time-of-trial rule is correct.

<p>This case stems from Armarcion Henderson's sentence of 60 months in prison after conviction for a felony punishable by 33 to 41 months in prison because the trial court wanted him to be eligible for a federal drug rehabilitation program that required a five-year sentence for eligibility. By the time Henderson appealed to the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], the Supreme Court had decided <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Tapia_v_United_States_131_S_Ct_2382_180_L_Ed_2d_357_2011_Court_Op">US v. Tapia</a> [opinion], in which it ruled that federal law did not allow courts to lengthen a sentence for the purpose of promoting rehabilitation. The Fifth Circuit, however, applied the time-of-trial rule, and <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Henderson_646_F3d_223_5th_Cir_2011_Court_Opinion">ruled</a> [opinion] that because <em>Tapia</em> had not been decided at the time of his trial there was no plain error made by the trial court. Later, however, around the time that Henderson's petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em> in the Supreme Court was filed, the Fifth Circuit took another case rejecting the time-of-trial doctrine and adopting the time-of-appeal rule.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The committee specifically mentioned that Iran is using torture, inhumane treatment of prisoners, public executions, executions of minors, hanging as an execution method, targeting of human rights defenders, and discrimination and violence against women and ethnic minorities. It also expressed concern over restrictions placed on eligibility and activities of 2012 parliamentary election candidates. The committee called on the government of Iran to take substantial steps to address these human rights concerns and conform its human rights standards to international human rights standards, as well as to ensure that the 2013 presidential election is "free, fair, transparent and inclusive."

<p>Iran has also been criticized by other human rights groups recently for its treatment of prisoners and other human rights abuses. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/amnesty-international-calls-on-iran-to-investigate-abuse-of-female-prisoners.php">detailed abuses against female prisoners</a> [JURIST report] and called on the government to investigate alleged mistreatment. Last month Iran <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/10-executed-in-iran-despite-pleas-by-human-rights-groups-ai.php">executed 10 men</a> [JURIST report] for drug charges, despite objections from the UN and AI. An AI director said that drug charges do not rise to the level of a crime that would permit use of the death penalty and claimed the Iranian government "know(s) full well" that these actions were not consistent with international human rights standards. Also last month the UN reported that Iran was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-iran-threatening-human-rights-activists.php">torturing human rights activists</a> [JURIST report] and threatening their families with rape and death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The death sentences are primarily symbolic, as all of the defendants live outside of Egypt and are thus not likely to face the sentence. The eight defendants <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egypt-court-sentences-in-absentia-7-coptic-christians-us-pastor-to-death-over-anti-islam-film/2012/11/28/b449cc56-3967-11e2-9258-ac7c78d5c680_story.html">included</a> [AP report] Mark Basseley Youssef, the California man behind the film, as well as Florida pastor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=terry+jones">Terry Jones</a> [JURIST news archive], who aroused controversy last year by publicly burning a Koran. The amateur film depicts the Prophet Muhammad as a fraud and a womanizer. The court <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/11/20121128184256776601.html">found the defendants guilty</a> [Al Jazeera report] of subverting national unity, spreading false information and insulting Islam, charges that carry the death penalty in Egypt. A final verdict is scheduled for January 29. 

<p><em>Innocence of Muslims</em> has generated a great deal of political, religious and legal controversy. In September an actress who claims she was duped into appearing in the film <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/actress-files-federal-lawsuit-to-remove-anti-islam-film-film-from-youtube.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]  requesting that the film be removed from YouTube. Earlier in September UN Special Rapporteur <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/AssemblyAssociation/Pages/SRFreedomAssemblyAssociationIndex.aspx">Maina Kiai</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-expert-condemns-violent-protests-over-anti-islam-film.php">condemned the violence</a> [JURIST report] that erupted after the film's release. Kiai stated that protests and rallies must be peaceful to be protected by international human rights law and urged the Middle East states to prosecute those responsible for the violence. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-violence-over-anti-islam-film.php">urged religious and political leaders</a> [JURIST report] to encourage an end to the violence that followed the release of the film. While Pillay said she "fully understand[s] why people wish to protest strongly against" the film, she "utterly condemn[s]" the violence that has resulted from the protests. US Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] declared that the US <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-usa-clinton-film-idUSBRE88D0E820120914">had nothing to do with the anti-Muslim film</a> [Reuters report] despite its apparent production in America, in turn labeling it disgusting and reprehensible.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Haradinaj was a commander of the KLA in the Dukagjin area of Western Kosovo; Balaj, a commander of a special operations unit known as the Black Eagles; and Brahimaj was Deputy Commander of the Dukagjin Operative Zone. In April 2008, the Trial Chamber originally <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-acquits-former-kosovo-pm-of-war.php">acquitted Haradinaj</a> [JURIST report] of all charges, as was Balaj, but Brahimaj was convicted of mistreating a detainee and ordering the mistreatment of another, and was sentenced to six years in jail. However, in July 2010, the ICTY Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icty-appeals-chamber-reverses-acquittal-of-former-kosovo-pm.php">reversed the judgments</a> [JURIST report], finding that the Trial Chamber had failed to take sufficient steps to counter witness intimidation. The ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icty-begins-retrial-of-former-kosovo-pm-haradinaj.php">began the retrial</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011, with the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/icty-prosecutor-seeks-20-year-sentence-for-former-kosovo-pm.php">prosecutor seeking a 20-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] for Haradinaj. However, the Trial Chamber rendered judgment in favor of the defendants, ordering for their immediate release.

<p>Since its establishment in 1993, the ICTY has indicted 161 people for violations of humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001; of those indicted, the trials of 128 have concluded, with proceedings for 33 currently ongoing. Last Friday, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-overturns-convictions-of-two-croatia-generals.php">overturned the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of two Croat generals for crimes against humanity and war crimes against Serb civilians committed during a 1995 military blitz.

The Second Circuit blocked a decision by the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] that ordered Argentina's government to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-22/argentina-must-pay-1-33-billion-to-owners-of-bonds.html">pay the $1.3 billion into an escrow account</a> [Bloomberg report] by December 15. Last week Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/argentina-to-appeal-us-federal-appeals-court-order-to-pay-133-billion-to-investors.php">appealed the district court's decision</a> [JURIST report], saying that it was unfair. Argentine <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.ar/">President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/APcb3eb0d2dce34ce3b2bc303061923d9c.html">called the district court's ruling "judicial colonialism"</a> [WSJ report] and refused to pay the debt to NML Capital. The Second Circuit has scheduled oral arguments for February 27.

<p>In October the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-orders-argentina-to-pay-more-than-1-billion-to-investors.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Argentina must pay $1.33 billion to bondholders when it repays its debts stemming from an economic collapse in 2001. The Second Circuit affirmed a district court ruling that Argentina breached a promise when it prioritized paying holders of its restructured debt over the bondholders who held its defaulted debt. In August the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/second-circuit-rejects-argentina-sovereign-immunity-argument-upholds-judgments.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Argentina's attempt to prevent bondholders from acquiring bank documents regarding the country's assets outside US territory, declaring that sovereign immunity was not an acceptable defense in this case. In September 2011 the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/second-circuit-rejects-argentina-sovereign-immunity-argument-upholds-judgments.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Argentina had to comply with subpoenas requested by NML Capital Ltd. for the collection of five money judgments totaling about $1.6 billion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report identifies six <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) facilities and 98 <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] facilities that could hold the detainees and points out that there are already 373 prisoners convicted of terrorism in facilities throughout the US. While the DOD asserts that it has the legal authority under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:S.J.Res23:">Authorization for Use of Military Force</a> (AUMF) [text] to maintain custody of the detainees, the DOJ does not consider itself to have such authority and would require additional statutory authority in order to do so. However, the DOJ maintains that it has the "correctional expertise to safely and securely house detainees with a history or nexus to terrorism." 

<p>Feinstein, who is chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, commissioned the report in 2008 and <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GUANTANAMO_DETAINEES?">welcomed</a> [AP report] its findings, stating that it "demonstrates that if the political will exists we could finally close Guantanamo without imperiling our national security." Last month, the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/aclu-urges-obama-to-close-guantanamo-during-second-term.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] President Barack Obama to close the military prison during his second term. During his 2008 campaign for the presidency, Obama pledged to close the prison and during his second day in office he issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ClosureOfGuantanamoDetentionFacilities">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] directing the prison to be closed. However, in the face of <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-house-rejects-domestic-transfer-of.php">congressional opposition</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration missed its self-imposed deadline to close Guantanamo military prison, and, following the 2010 mid-term congressional election, congress <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php#closure">effectively halted</a> [JURIST backgrounder] plans to close the facility. According to Forum contributor Jonathan Hafetz, Obama <a href="/forum/2011/04/failing-to-close-guantanamo.php">bears responsibility</a> [JURIST op-ed] for the political missteps that prevented Guantanamo from closing and criticizes the president for embracing the "larger detention system that Guantanamo embodies." Conversely, Forum contributor David Frakt agrees that the Obama administration is partially responsible, but believes <a href="/forum/2012/09/david-frakt-guantanamo-detainees.php">congress is largely to blame</a> [JURIST op-ed] for passing a "series of increasingly stringent spending restrictions which have made it virtually impossible to transfer most detainees out of Guantanamo."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's ruling will bar strictly-followed slaughtering practices by Muslim and Jewish citizens where the animal is not stunned first. The decision conflicts with a 2009 EU <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:303:0001:0030:EN:PDF">law</a> [text, PDF], scheduled to go into effect this January, that regulates slaughtering procedures but makes an exception for religious practices. Animal rights activists who brought the case had insisted that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20523809">Poland may opt out of the EU law</a> [BBC report], but Poland's Agriculture Minister Stanislaw Kalemba has said that the EU regulation will take precedence, allowing ritual slaughter to continue in Poland.

<p>Animal rights remain a contentious issue around the world, particularly when they clash with religious and cultural tradition. Earlier this month, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) upheld a German injunction preventing the activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) from <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/europe-rights-court-upholds-ban-on-use-of-holocaust-images.php">using Holocaust images in an animal rights poster campaign</a> [JURIST report]. The campaign featured pictures of Holocaust victims alongside images of animals kept in mass stocks. In September, the Constitutional Council of France <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/france-constitutional-council-rejects-national-ban-on-bullfighting.php">rejected a challenge to the bullfighting exception</a> [JURIST report] contained in the animal cruelty provisions of the country's criminal code. The provisions provide an explicit exception for bullfights held in a region where an uninterrupted local tradition can be shown.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/judge-accepts-terms-under-which-manning-would-plead-guilty-to-lesser-charges/2012/11/29/e1d2ecae-3a41-11e2-b01f-5f55b193f58f_story.html">decision</a> [WP report] by judge Col. Denise R. Lind does not bind the prosecution to accept the terms or prevent them from adding charges. Manning <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/army-private-charged-in-wikileaks-case-offers-guilty-plea.php">offered his guilty plea</a> [JURIST report] to seven of the more minor charges earlier in the month through a pleading process called "exceptions and substitutions." Prosecutors handling the case have not yet indicated if they will accept any portion of the plea terms offered.

<p>Manning's case has engendered a great deal of controversy. In August JURIST guest columnist Philip Cave argued that the <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">lack of transparency</a> [JURIST op-ed] in Manning's case undermines the validity of the eventual verdict. In June Lind ordered the prosecution to submit to her a number of files that were allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-to-review-allegedly-withheld-evidence-in-wikileaks-trial.php">withheld from the defense during discovery</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in June Lind <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/military-judge-denies-motion-to-dismiss-wikileaks-charges.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] to dismiss eight of the 22 charges against Manning after his defense had argued they were unconstitutionally vague. In May UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez accused the US government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-the-un-special-rapporteur.php">cruel and inhuman treatment</a> [JURIST report] of Manning. The US military court referred Manning's <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-refers-intelligence-analyst%27s-wikileaks-case-for-court-martial.php">case for court-martial</a> in February after a US Army panel of experts declared Manning <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">competent to stand tria</a>l [JURIST reports] last April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two supervisors, Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, are each <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-28/three-bp-managers-appear-in-court-to-answer-spill-charges-1-.html">charged with manslaughter</a> [Bloomberg report] in connection with the death of 11 workers during the spill. Federal investigators have alleged that Kaluza and Vidrine ignored warning signs leading up to the spill. Former BP executive David Rainey is facing obstruction charges based on allegations that he lied to federal investigators to downplay the severity of the spill. All three men pleaded not guilty on Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, the US <a href="http://epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] announced that BP would be <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/2aaf1c1dc80c969885257abf006dafb0!OpenDocument">indefinitely suspended</a> [press release] from bidding on government contracts, saying the company's "lack of business integrity" has disqualified them from consideration. The EPA said that it would only contract with BP again if the company shows that it "meets Federal business standards," but it did not specify what the company must do. 

<p>US Attorney General Eric Holder announced earlier this month that BP had agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pay a record $4.5 billion in penalties and to plead guilty</a> [JURIST report] to felony misconduct for its role in the devastation caused by the oil spill. Also this month, the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-and-gulf-oil-spill-plaintiffs-urge-federal-judge-to-approve-settlement-agreement.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding approval of a class-action settlement agreement between BP and various individuals and businesses affected by the Deepwater Horizon incident. There, attorneys on both sides urged Judge Carl Barbier to approve the settlement agreement, under which BP is expected to pay approximately $7.8 billion. It has been argued that the settlement is a <a href="/hotline/2012/05/tim-mcevoy-bp-settlement.php">step in the right direction</a> [JURIST op-ed] for compensating those affected by the oil spill. In May Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/dnp-1.php">signed a case management order</a> [JURIST report] outlining the structure for the upcoming trial of Gulf oil spill claims, scheduled for January 14, 2013. The judge divided the trial into two phases. In phase one, or the "incident" phase, the court will address issues arising out of the various parties' conduct leading to the incident and appropriation of their negligence. Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-gulf-oil-spill-settlement.php">gave preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to the proposed settlement agreement earlier that month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The couple, who already have one child with cystic fibrosis, brought suit after they sought an embryo screening as a precautionary method for future children and were denied under medical law. Issued in August, the judgment stated that Italy's <a href="http://www.uaar.it/laicita/bioetica/10g.pdf">Law 40</a> [text, PDF, in Italian], a ban on embryonic screening titled "Rules on Medically Assisted Procreation," violates Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> for failing to recognize the right to privacy and family life. The ECHR ordered the Italian government to pay the couple &#8364;17,500 (USD $21,900) in damages and court fees.

<p>The Italian government <a href="http://www.corriere.it/english/12_agosto_30/government_d6456ac0-f29c-11e1-9efb-e78611c7bd41.shtml">planned to appeal the ECHR's ruling</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report] immediately after it was issued, and were given until this week to do so. The country's Law 40 is controversial in light of its ban on IVF, which is a type of fertility treatment for couples who have had difficulty conceiving children or wish to avoid passing genetic traits on to their children. Through IVF, a woman's eggs are removed and fertilized outside the body. Successfully fertilized embryos are then implanted into the woman for gestation. Italy <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/28/us-italy-embryo-idUSBRE8AR17Z20121128">has defended its ban</a> [Reuters report] on embryonic screening by claiming that it wishes to avoid risks of eugenic abuses and the potential for future "designer babies." The largely Catholic nation has some of the strictest artificial procreation laws in Europe.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Although the original ruling found that a piece of metal that fell off of the Continental plane and onto the runway had later caused the damage that led to the Concorde's crash, the appeals court <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/french-court-clears-continental-of-concorde-crash">declared</a> [Reuters report] that John Taylor, the mechanic responsible for fitting the metal, could never have imagined that such a small component could cause such a disaster. While the metal part played a crucial role in the crash, opined the court, such a mistake does not carry with it criminal liability. Taylor was originally sentenced to a 15-month suspended sentence and a fine of USD $2,670 while Continental was ordered to pay Air France USD $1.44 million for damage to its reputation and fines of roughly USD $267,000. 

<p>Continental Airlines and Taylor were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/france-court-convicts-us-airline-in-concorde-jet-crash.php">originally convicted</a> [JURIST report] by a lower French court in 2010. Their trial, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/france-court-begins-concorde-jet-crash.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in February 2010, was met with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1247890/Air-France-Concorde-crash-trial-opens-Paris.html">criticism</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] for starting a decade after the accident occurred and after victims' families had already received settlements in 2001. Following the crash, the <a href="http://www.bea.aero/index.php">French Bureau of Investigations and Analysis</a> [official website, in French] <a href="http://www.bea-fr.org/docspa/2000/f-sc000725a/pdf/f-sc000725a.pdf">concluded</a> [report, in French, PDF] in 2004 that the crash was caused by a metal strip that fell from the Continental Airlines flight and pierced the Concorde's tire. The Concorde jet, which was officially retired by all airlines in 2003, killed 113 people when Air France flight 4590 crashed into a hotel shortly after takeoff in July 2000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.gazetaprawna.pl/artykuly/665274,sad-najwyzszy-homoseksualny-partner-przejmuje-po-smierci-partnera-prawo-do-najmu-mieszkania.html">decision</a> [<em>Gazeta Prawna</em> report, in Polish] resulted from a request by a lower appeals court to determine the law by interpreting a portion of the Polish Civil Code which allowed retained property rights for those who were in "cohabitation" with the lessee. The case centered on a man listed in case documents only as "Adam K." whose romantic partner of nine years had recently passed away. The owners of the apartment which the men shared were seeking to evict Adam claiming that his relationship gave him no legal standing to maintain the lease. Prior to this ruling the courts had only recognized spouses, children, or heterosexual partners as meeting the criteria of the code. The court has not yet offered its written judgment but expects to publish its reasoning soon.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontapplesamsung.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A Netherlands court ruled on Wednesday to ban certain <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung Electronics</a> smartphones that infringe on <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate websites] patents. The court ordered Samsung to pay Apple 100,000 euros for every day that it <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-28/apple-wins-partial-dutch-ban-on-galaxy-devices-in-samsung-clash.html">violates</a> [Bloomberg report] the court's ruling. The court also ordered Samsung to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/samsung-galaxy-products-infringe-apple-patent-dutch-court-154944035--finance.html">pay damages</a> [Reuters report] to Apple based on the amount it receives through sales. The amount of its profits that Samsung must pay Apple will be determined in a separate court proceeding. As a result of the ruling, the Netherlands has now banned certain Galaxy tablets and smartphones, which use the Android operating system. The ruling will only affect sales of older Samsung products after Samsung last year changed the feature on its smartphones that violated Apple's patent for navigating through photos on the phone.

<p>The Netherlands court's ruling is the latest in the <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] between Apple and Samsung. Last week Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/apple-adds-products-to-samsung-patent-infringement-suit.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the Northern District of California requesting permission to add six additional products to its patent infringement claim against Samsung Electronics. According to court documents, Apple sought to supplement its claim with newer Samsung products brought to market after the original lawsuit was filed in February. Last month a judge for the US International Trade Commission <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">issued a preliminary ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung infringed four of Apple's patents relating to smartphone design and touchscreen technology. In October the Dutch Rechtbank's-Gravenhage court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ban stressed the importance of countries adopting national legislation to combat violence against women and girls in addition to denouncing these acts of violence. The UN said that violence against women is one of the most widespread human rights violations. In certain countries as many as 7 in 10 children have been or will be beaten, raped, abused or mutilated at some point in their lifetimes. Ban stated:<blockquote>Many international standards, treaties, declarations and resolutions recognize women's rights as human rights and specifically condemn violence against women. These instruments apply at all times&#8212;in war and peace, in poverty and wealth, in sickness and health, and throughout the life cycle. Under all conditions, women have a right to lives of dignity and safety. Today more than ever we must hold on to the solid human rights framework that has been built over decades.</blockquote>The UN General Assembly passed a resolution in 1999 designating November 25 as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, urging governmental and non governmental organizations to raise awareness about the worldwide problem of violence against women.

<p>On Monday the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] calling for a global ban on female genital mutilation (FGM). The committee's resolution calls on the UN's 193 member countries to enact and enforce legislation to protect women and girls from female circumcision and other genital mutilation procedures and to end impunity for violators. Earlier this month an independent UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-expert-urges-justice-for-domestic-violence-victims-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina.php">urged justice</a> [JURIST report] for victims of domestic violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), saying high rates of violence can largely be attributed to war-related Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, addiction and poverty. The report was offered by UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women Rashida Manjoo, who stressed the urgency for all levels of government to recognize female victims of rape and torture as a result of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian Civil War</a> [JURIST news archive] and to ensure that women have equal access to remedies and services, regardless of their ethnic or religious backgrounds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontegyptflag.jpg" alt="The Egyptian Flag" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] said Friday that Pillay has sent a letter to Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12849&LangID=E">urging him to reconsider</a> [press release] a recent decree expanding presidential powers. Pillay worries that the Constitutional Declaration, while a welcome effort towards reaching out to the judiciary and political parties, has the potential to allow violations of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm">International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights</a> [text], which Egypt ratified in 1981. Pillay stated:<blockquote>The three slogans of the Egyptian Revolution, were liberty, freedom and social justice. These same principles underlie all international human rights law, including both Covenants. In order for them to be achieved, there need to be prompt, effective and impartial investigations, truth-seeking processes, judicial accountability mechanisms, and reparation programmes, as well as a strengthening of institutional reform and guaranteeing of non-recurrence of the violations that were rampant during the Mubarak era.</blockquote> There are additional concerns that the Constitutional Assembly did not adequately represent a full political and cultural spectrum, and that actions such as adopting a Constitution might cause further tension. 

<p>Egypt has undergone some political turmoil since its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST feature]. Earlier this week Egyptian courts <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-courts-suspend-work-to-protest-presidential-decree.php">suspended work</a> to protest the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-vastly-expands-powers-prompting-protests.php">decree</a> [JURIST reports] issued by Morsi last week which removed judicial review of his actions and vastly expanded his power. Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-to-meet-with-judges-after-vast-power-expansion.php">agreed to meet with the judges</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week to discuss the decree. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-urged-to-amend-draft-constitution-comply-with-international-treaties-hrw.php">amend its proposed constitution</a> [JURIST report] to comply with international treaties. In August a lawyer in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-lawyer-challenges-morsi-declaration.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging a declaration by Morsi granting himself <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">complete legislative and executive power</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in</a>, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the country's <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] dissolving parliament after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Days before its dissolution, the Egyptian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-court-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-political-isolation-law.php">elected</a> a new constitutional council after lawmakers finally <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-reaches-agreement-on-constitutional-panel.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST reports] on the political composition of the council. In April the country's Administrative Court temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/egypt-administrative-court-suspends-constitutional-panel.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the work of the Egyptian Constituent Assembly after ruling in favor of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the formation of the panel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The approved constitution seeks to uphold the "principles of Islamic Law." According to AI, the document's language "ignores the rights of women, restricts freedom of expression in the name of protecting religion, and allows for the military trial of civilians." Approximately 30 Christian and liberal members boycotted the assembly in protest of the Islamist members' loyalty to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder], who recently caused a political uproar when he issued a decree granting himself sweeping powers. The Islamist-dominated panel then hurried to approve the draft before Sunday, when Egypt's highest judicial power is expected to render a decision that would dissolve the panel entirely. The hurried approval of the country's new constitution by Islamists <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/30/us-egypt-president-idUSBRE8AM0DO20121130">sparked protests</a> [Reuters report] by tens of thousands of Egyptians The newly approved constitution is expected to be put to a nationwide referendum as early as mid-December.

<p>Egyptian lawmakers reached an agreement on the <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-elects-second-panel-to-draft-constitution.php">composition of the constitutional panel</a> [JURIST report] in June, after a controversy over the political balance threatened to halt the drafting of a new constitution. Prior to this agreement, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/egypt-parliament-meets-to-appoint-constitution-panel.php">domination of the proceedings by Islamists</a> [JURIST report] had been extremely controversial. This debate followed an Egyptian court ruling in February that the elaborate voting system in the parliamentary elections was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-court-rules-parliamentary-election-process-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called on Egypt's newly elected parliament to pursue an agenda to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/hrw-calls-on-new-egypt-parliament-to-expand-rights.php">reform nine areas of Egyptian law</a> [JURIST report] that impede freedom and restrict rights. Some of the suggested reforms included ending the state of emergency, reforming police law and expanding freedom of expression, strengthening the criminal penalties for police abuse, amending Egypt's definition of torture to be in line with international standards and allowing independent NGOs to operate lawfully in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Attorney General Douglas Gansler's opinion came in response to questions from circuit court clerks around the state in the wake of referendum approval earlier this month. The opinion dictates that Maryland court clerks can begin accepting applications for same-sex marriages immediately and issue them as soon a December 6, as long as they specify that the licenses do not take effect until January 1, 2013. In addition, in regard to couples who have civil unions in other states, Gansler wrote, "In the absence of statutory language prohibiting the issuance of a marriage license to a couple who has entered into a civil union in another state, we see no obstacle to the issuance of a license in such situations."  

<p>Maryland is one of three states, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Maine</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Washington</a> [JURIST reports] to legalize same-sex marriage this November, and the ninth state overall, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports]. In the same election Minnesota voters struck down a ballot initiative that would have outlawed same-sex marriage in the state. The Maryland electorate voted to legalize same-sex marriage, upholding the <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/2012rs/chapters_noln/Ch_2_hb0438T.pdf">Civil Marriage Protection Act</a> [official act, PDF] by a slim margin earlier this month. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/maryland-becomes-eighth-state-to-allow-same-sex-marriage.php">originally signed</a> [JURIST report] by Governor O'Malley in March, however The <a href="http://www.elections.state.md.us/">Maryland Board of Elections</a> [official website] had <a href="http://www.elections.state.md.us/petitions/Certification_Notice_civil_marriage.pdf">officially certified</a >[certification notice, PDF] a referendum petition in July seeking <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/maryland-board-of-elections-approves-same-sex-marriage-repeal.php">to challenge the law</a> [JURIST report] in the recent election. The law will take effect on January 1, 2013. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> (UNGA) [official website] passed the resolution on Thursday, elevating Palestine from "non-member observer entity" to "non-member observer state." In a statement released to reporters on Friday, the ICC said that it would <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/30/palestine-legal-status-icc_n_2217874.html?">consider</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] how the resolution will affect the ICC's relationship with Palestine. The Palestinian Authority (PA) had previously sought to allow ICC jurisdiction in Palestine, but the court said in April that it <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-lacks-jurisdiction-to-investigate-palestine-war-crimes-claims-prosecutor.php">did not have jurisdiction in Palestine</a> [JURIST report] because the UN had not recognized its statehood. 

<p>Tension in the Palestinian region has led to international human rights concerns. In June, a UN expert told the  Human Rights Council that people in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories are <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-expert-concerned-over-free-speech-in-israel-palestine.php">severely limited in free expression</a> [JURIST report], both by the official governing bodies, and de facto authorities like Hamas. In February Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-israel-to-end-residency-restrictions.php">urged Israel to change</a> [JURIST report] its policies of forbidding Palestinians from traveling through and living in Gaza and the West Bank. Its report demonstrated that due to the policies, families are kept separate since some are trapped inside Israel while their family members are forbidden from entering. In January of last year, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-official-expresses-concern-over-violence-against-palestinians.php">alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Israeli authorities engaged in illegal activities including the killing of four Palestinians.I n 2009 Palestine submitted the<a href="http://uclalawforum.com/media/background/gaza/2009-01-21_Palestinian_National_Authority_Declaration.pdf"> Declaration recognizing the Jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court</a> [text, PDF] to allow the ICC to investigate into the alleged crimes against Palestinians. <br />

Currently, under the 1986 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> [text], law enforcement agents only need a warrant to access emails less than 6 months old. The new bill is sponsored by committee chairman Senator <a href="http://www.leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> [official website], who was also the lead author of the 1986 law. Leahy explained during the committee vote that with new technologies and expanding government surveillance, Americans face a <a href="http://www.telegram.com/article/20121130/NEWS/111309726/1052">greater threat to their digital privacy</a> [AP report]. The full Senate is currently in a lame-duck session and is not expected to consider the bill until it reconvenes early next year. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/technology-and-liberty/aclu-lens-get-my-cloud-senate-bill-requires-warrants-government-spy">applauded the proposed legislation</a> [press release], but the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] and other law enforcement groups have voiced opposition to the bill, saying it would impede criminal investigations. 

<p>Communications privacy has become a controversial issue in recent years in light of technological advances. Leahy introduced a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-senator-leahy-proposes-bill-requiring-warrants-to-search-e-mails.php">similar email protection bill</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011, stating the law needed an update to reflect the realities of our time. In 2010, the Federal Bureau Investigation (FBI) came under fire after it was discovered that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/fbi-illegally-collected-phone-records.php">collected more than 2,000 telephone records</a> [JURIST report] between 2002 and 2006 by claiming the phone calls being made related to possible terrorism emergencies. In 2005, the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] held that the Electronic Communications Privacy Act should be <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-e.php">broadly interpreted</a> [JURIST report] allowing an email provider alleged to have read correspondence in transit to customers to be tried on federal charges.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

At the end of his official visit to Turkey, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=15445&language=0">Christof Heyns</a> [academic profile] commented that Turkey has implemented several laws in the past decade that have the potential to bring human rights abusers to justice. However, Heyns also observed that Turkey's government has not been proactive enough in prosecuting perpetrators of violence, especially those who commit violence against women: <blockquote>Many people interviewed during the visit question the extent to which the political will exists to bring perpetrators to book. Likewise, while some commendable initiatives are being taken, domestic violence against women, for example in the form of so-called honour killings, is also not curbed effectively by prosecution or other measures. ... This situation persists against a background where there has been little accountability for the large number of killings that took place during the 1990s. Where prosecutions take place, it is largely for offences against the State, rather than for violations of the right to life.</blockquote>Heyns is scheduled to present a report on his visit to Turkey to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] next year. 

<p>Turkey has faced international criticism recently for its human rights record. Last month the UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-committee-criticizes-turkish-counterterrorism-laws.php">chastised Turkey</a> [JURIST report] for prosecuting activists under the country's vague counterterrorism law. In October the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/echr-rules-detention-of-gay-man-violated-rights-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <em>X. v. Turkey</em> that a gay man was detained in violation of Articles 3 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In July a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/turkish-court-releases-16-individuals-accused-of-having-links-to-kurdish-militants.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the release of 16 individuals detained on accusations of having links to Kurdish militants. Also in July UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants Francois Crepeau called on the government of Turkey and authorities in the EU to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-official-calls-on-turkey-eu-to-respect-rights-of-migrants.php">respect the rights of migrants</a> [JURIST report]. In June the Turkish ruling party planned to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/turkey-to-abolish-controversial-special-courts-report.php">abolish the special courts</a> [JURIST report] used in coup and terrorism trials. The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) plans to present a reform package including the proposed abolition of special courts to the country's parliament before the recess.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In their lawsuit, <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/sevcik-v-sandoval">Sevcik v. Sandoval</a> [Lambda Legal backgrounder], the couples argued that Nevada's marriage law unlawfully places same-sex couples in an inferior status compared with their heterosexual counterparts. The court rejected this argument, however, saying that because Nevada's interest in restricting marriage to one man and one woman is legitimate and the state's marriage law is not based on animus toward same-sex couples, the marriage law is constitutional:<blockquote>Because the maintenance of the traditional institution of civil marriage as between one man and one woman is a legitimate state interest, because the exclusion of same-sex couples from the institution of civil marriage is rationally related to furthering that interest, and because the challenged laws neither withdraw any existing rights nor effect a broad change in the legal status or protections of homosexuals based upon pure animus, the State is entitled to summary judgment.</blockquote>The eight same-sex couples plan to appeal the ruling to the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been a controversial issue recently both in the US and around the globe. In November voters in <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maryland-ag-releases-opinion-on-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">Maryland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Maine</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Washington</a> legalized same-sex marriage [JURIST reports]. In the same election Minnesota voters struck down a ballot initiative that would have outlawed same-sex marriage in the state. Also in November JURIST guest columnist Douglas NeJaime <a href="/forum/2012/11/douglas-nejaime-marriage-democracy.php">opined</a> [JURIST op-ed] that recent voter approval of state referenda legalizing same-sex marriage makes it difficult for opponents to use democratic principles to argue against judicial action on the issue. Earlier that month Nigeria's House of Representatives passed a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/nigeria-house-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">criminalizes same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that week Malawi's government <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/malawi-changes-position-on-suspension-of-anti-gay-laws.php">changed its position</a> [JURIST report] on a decision to suspend its laws barring same-sex marriage and homosexuality after being pressured by a number of churches.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Myriad Genetics, Inc.</a> [cert. petition PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/aclu-requests-supreme-court-review-of-validity-of-two-cancer-gene-patents.php">report</a>], which deals with the issue of whether human genes are patentable. <a href="http://www.myriad.com/">Myriad Genetics</a> [corporate website] patented two genes, <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/risk/brca">BRCA1 and BRCA2</a> [NCI backgrounder], which are isolated genes&#8212;different from native genes because the process of extracting them changes their molecular structure but not their genetic code. The <a href="http://www.amp.org/">Association for Molecular Pathology</a> [advocacy website] and other plaintiffs argue that human genes cannot be patentable simply because they have been isolated from DNA. They also contend that Myriad's use of its patent to limit research and clinical testing on these genes has inhibited other laboratories from offering new testing procedures and made it impossible for patients to obtain second opinions that could offer more information about their cancer risks. The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-again-validates-cancer-gene-patents.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in August that Myriad had a right to patent the isolated cells because they were "transformed" and Myriad's method of isolation included steps that were not naturally occurring. When asked to reconsider the case in light of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1150.pdf">Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.</a> [opinion, PDF], a case in which the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year to deny medical tests relying on correlations between drug dosages and treatment cannot be patented, the judges were split on how it applied and each stuck to his or her original decision on the outcome.

<p>The second case the court agreed to hear is <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/12-142-Bartlett-Cert-Petition-FINAL-1.pdf">Mutual Pharmaceutical Co. v. Bartlett</a> [cert. petition, PDF], which presents the issue of whether federal law preempts state law design-defect claims against pharmaceutical companies. In this case, the plaintiff sustained permanent injuries from ingestion of a generic drug made by Mutual Pharmaceuticals. The main argument from the plaintiff in his petition to the Supreme Court is that the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] contradicted Supreme Court precedent in <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Bartlett_v_Mutual_Pharmaceutical_Co_678_F3d_30_1st_Cir_2012_Court">ruling</a> [opinion] that federal law did not preempt the plaintiff's design-defect claim. In 2011, the Supreme Court decided in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-993.pdf">PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-holds-federal-law-preempts-in-generic-drug-cases.php">report</a>] that federal regulations on warning labels preempt state law on warning labels. The First Circuit differentiated these cases in ruling that the Supreme Court has not addressed the specific issue of design-defect claims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenged law, <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/display/20112012/HB/954">HB 954</a> [text], bans abortions after 20 weeks and contains a narrow exception for medical emergencies. The ACLU argues that, although abortions after 20 weeks are rare, women have many reasons for choosing to have them after that point, and this law will create obstacles to obtaining necessary procedures. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, who signed the bill into law in May, <a href="http://gov.georgia.gov/press-releases/2012-05-01/deal-enacts-pro-life-bill">said</a> [press release] the law "provides humane protection to innocents capable of feeling pain, while making an important exception for in the case of medically futile pregnancies." The law is set to take effect on January 1.</p>

<p>Numerous states have changed their abortion laws to restrict the availability of abortion recently, usually leading to legal challenges. Last month, Montana voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Georgia's law, bans abortions after 20 weeks. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In response to the UN action Israel passed its own domestic resolution that <a href="http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=294270">rejects the General Assembly's decision entirely</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] and claims it has no effect on Israeli citizen's rights to disputed territory. The Israeli resolution also states that Israel will not allow the UN resolution to affect future negotiations and peace talks. Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz further <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/12/2012122101441576517.html">announced</a> [Al Jazeera report] that the Israeli government will not transfer taxes collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to the PA, and will instead use those revenues to off-set the debt of Palestinian companies for electrical usage. The funds are customs duties levied on Palestinian goods that come through Israeli ports, amounting to tens of millions of dollars transferred to the PA every month. The amount of taxes currently being withheld by Isreal is estimated to be $120 million.

<p>Tensions have increased between Israel and Palestine recently.

Deputy Prime Minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090211/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> and former cabinet minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200109/related%20cases/icc01090111/Pages/icc01090111.aspx">William Ruto</a> [case materials] are two of four Kenyans set to stand trial in the ICC in April for crimes against humanity arising out of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kenya+and+2007+and+election">2007 post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive] in which more than 1,000 people died. The two candidates <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/02/us-kenya-politics-idUSBRE8B10AH20121202">announced</a> [Reuters report] that they will be running together in the next presidential election, scheduled to take place in March. Despite assurances otherwise, many are concerned the pair will not agree to stand trial should they win the election a month before the hearing. Additionally, some have challenged the pair's campaign by claiming the ICC charges render them unsuitable candidates. ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/TheProsecutor2012.htm">Fatou Bensouda</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-chief-procecutor-visits-kenya-to-prepare-for-post-election-violence-trial.php">visited Kenya</a> [JURIST report] in October in preparation for the trial of the four Kenyans, at which point she emphasized that the trial will proceed, and Kenyatta and Ruto will not be given immunity if they win the election.

<p>Concern surrounding the trial has been growing as the trial and election draw closer. In October the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-kenya-must-fully-cooperate-in-post-election-violence-investigation.php">called for complete cooperation</a> [JURIST report] from the Kenyan government in the investigation and trial process. In June the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/kenya-election-trials-should-run-simultaneously-icc-prosecutor.php">expressed its desire to start the two Kenyan trials simultaneously</a> [JURIST report] to avoid any appearance of bias in the presidential election. In May the appeals chamber of the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/icc-rejects-jurisdiction-challenge-in-kenya-cases.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] the jurisdiction challenges in the two cases presented by the defense, clearing the way for trial. The defense lawyers had argued that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the cases. The appeal stemmed from the pre-trial chamber's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icc-confirms-charges-against-4-suspects-for-kenya-violence.php">confirm the charges</a> [JURIST report] against the four men in January. The ICC claimed jurisdiction over the case despite <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">Kenya's calls for dismissal</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Supporters of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20571718">flooded the court</a> [BBC report], blocking the judges from entering and forcing them to delay hearing a case scheduled for Sunday that would permit them to dissolve the constituent assembly that drafted the new constitution. The constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">hurriedly approved</a> [JURIST report] on Friday in anticipation of the Sunday hearing. On Saturday Morsi set December 15 for a referendum on the new constitution. Tens of thousands of moderate and conservative Islamists gathered around Cairo University in support for the constitution, cheering as Morsi announced the referendum. However tens of thousands of liberal and secular protesters, who have been protesting Morsi for over a week after he <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-vastly-expands-powers-prompting-protests.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST report] vastly expanding his powers, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egyptian-assembly-rushes-to-vote-on-new-constitution/2012/11/30/21c21f4e-3ad1-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_story_1.html">objected to the constitution-writing assembly</a> [WP report], stating that the body was unrepresentative after liberal, secular and Christian members had left. Such protesters are calling for Morsi to abandon his decree and begin the constitution drafting process anew, but Morsi dismissed the idea of drafting a new constitution. Mass protests have been scheduled for Tuesday.

<p>Egypt has undergone political turmoil since its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST feature] last year. Earlier this week Egyptian courts <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-courts-suspend-work-to-protest-presidential-decree.php">suspended work</a> [JURIST report] to protest Morsi's recent decree, which removed judicial review of his actions and vastly expanded his power. Morsi had <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-to-meet-with-judges-after-vast-power-expansion.php">agreed to meet with the judges</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week to discuss the decree. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-urged-to-amend-draft-constitution-comply-with-international-treaties-hrw.php">amend its proposed constitution</a> [JURIST report] to comply with international treaties. In August a lawyer in Egypt <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-lawyer-challenges-morsi-declaration.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging a declaration by Morsi granting himself complete <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">legislative and executive power</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in</a> as president, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolving parliament after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Days before its dissolution, the Egyptian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-court-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-political-isolation-law.php">elected</a> a new constitutional council after lawmakers finally <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-reaches-agreement-on-constitutional-panel.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST reports] on the political composition of the council. In April the country's Administrative Court temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/egypt-administrative-court-suspends-constitutional-panel.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] the work of the Egyptian Constituent Assembly after ruling in favor of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the formation of the panel.<br />

The ICJ ended the dispute between the two nations by <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icj-rules-for-colombia-in-dispute-with-nicaragua-over-islands.php">ruling that Colombia has sovereignty</a> [JURIST report] over a group of small islands in the western Caribbean, while Nicaragua has control over a large amount of the surrounding sea and seabed. Following the ruling Colombia <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/01/us-colombia-icj-idUSBRE8B00E620121201">withdrew</a> [Reuters report] from the <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/a-42.html">treaty</a> [text] binding the country to the ICJ's decisions. Both countries have placed warships in the disputed waters. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega stated that his country is discarding the use of force as an option and would use communication to achieve peace. Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos stated that war is a last resort, and the way to fix the situation is through dialogue. Santos also stated that Colombia would seek to overturn the decision. Colombians have been protesting the ruling, staging nationwide marches.

<p>In its ruling the ICJ <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/124/17162.pdf">decided unanimously</a> [press release, PDF] that Colombia had sovereignty "over the islands at Alburquerque, Bajo Nuevo, East-Southeast Cays, Quitasueno, Roncador, Serrana and Serranilla." The court recognized that the boundary lines they appropriated effectively divided the relevant in Nicaragua's favor, but found that the results were not disproportionate enough to create inequity. Nicaragua originally brought legal action against Colombia in December 2001, claiming that Colombia had no legal control of the islands. Public hearings were finally held between April and May of this year. A portion of Nicaragua's argument was rejected in 2007, when the ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/icj-upholds-1928-nicaragua-columbia.php">upheld a 1928 treaty between Nicaragua and Colombia</a> [JURIST report] establishing that Colombia owned the islands of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Del Ponte, a Swiss lawyer, worked at the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] from 1999-2008. Haradinaj, a Kosovo Albanian former guerrilla commander, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/war-crimes-tribunal-acquits-former-kosovo-liberation-army-commander.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] on crimes against humanity for the second time on Thursday in a retrial at the ICTY. The ICTY judges ruled "that there was insufficient evidence to establish the existence of a joint criminal enterprise in relation to the commission of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war" by Haradinaj during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kosovo+war">1998-99 Kosovo war with Serbia</a> [JURIST news archive]. Kosovo's government <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/02/us-kosovo-warcrimes-idUSBRE8B10DP20121202">issued a statement</a> [Reuters report] claiming the charges were unfounded and accused del Ponte of abusing her power in bringing charges against Haradinaj. The Kosovo government believes del Ponte's actions were criminal and urged the secretary general of the tribunal, the UN and other international authorities to investigate her work. All but one of the Kosovo Albanians that were charged with war crimes during the Kosovo war have had their convictions overturned. Kosovo <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,1">Prime Minister Hashim Thaci</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/?page=2,9,3241">statement</a> [press release] after the ruling calling it "just" and "the best proof that the Kosovo Liberation Army engaged in a just war for freedom and did not commit the crimes for which we have been unfairly accused."   

<p>Haradinaj's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icty-begins-retrial-of-former-kosovo-pm-haradinaj.php">retrial began</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011. The appeals chamber of the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icty-appeals-chamber-reverses-acquittal-of-former-kosovo-pm.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] the acquittal in July 2010 and ordered a retrial for Haradinaj after finding the integrity of the original proceedings was compromised and the Trial Chamber failed to take sufficient steps to counter witness intimidation that permeated the trial. Haradinaj was first <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/icty-acquits-former-kosovo-pm-of-war.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 when the Trial Chamber found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal enterprise. Del Ponte originally brought charges against Haradinaj and two KLA fighters in 2005 for <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/icty-trial-begins-for-former-kosovo.php">37 counts of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] including murder, persecution and rape. Del Ponte condemned many politicians of the former Yugoslavia, including Haradinaj, in her book "The Hunt: Me and War Criminals" that the Swiss government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/dnp-del-ponte-book-promotion.php">barred</a> [JURIST report] her from publicly promoting. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Qatada is wanted in Jordan on <em>in absentia</em> convictions of organizing and encouraging bomb attacks in 1999 and 2000, but the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/special-immigration-appeals-commission">UK Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> (SIAC) [official website] in mid-November <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/uk-court-denies-jordan-extradition-request-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">granted Qatada's appeal</a> [JURIST report] and blocked extradition requests due to skepticism that he would not receive a fair trial. The court expressed concern that the Jordanian court would allow the use of evidence extracted from torture of others despite <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/12/03/uk-britain-jordan-qatada-idUKBRE8B20J520121203">diplomatic assurances</a> [Reuters report] from Jordanian authorities in 2005 that the trial would proceed fairly. Those assurances were memorialized in a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Jordan and later <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-108629">partially approved</a> [opinion, PDF] in January 2012 by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website]. However, concerns for evenhanded adjudication in light of reports of alleged Jordanian human rights abuses remain. UK officials expressed serious concern after Qatada's successful appeal, as the Muslim cleric has been described as "Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe," and UK officials believe he should be kept in prison for national security reasons although he has never formally been charged with an offense in the UK. Qatada was first detained under British anti-terrorism laws in 2002.

<p>Palestinian-Jordanian Qatada has fought terrorism charges and extradition in court for more than a decade. The SIAC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/uk-court-denies-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada in May. In early February he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uk-court-sets-bail-for-muslim-cleric-abu-qatada.php">released on bail</a> [JURIST report] after he made an application for bail following the ECHR block of his deportation, but he was arrested again in April to begin deportation proceedings. Qatada was granted political asylum by the UK in 1994. When he was arrested in 2001 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, police seized a sizable sum of money in various currencies for which no explanation was given. Later in 2001, he went into hiding to avoid being arrested and detained under the then-proposed Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. He was arrested again in 2002 and held until March 2005 when he was released pursuant to a House of Lords judgment declaring his detention without trial to be unlawful. In February 2009 the ECHR ordered the UK to pay <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">2,500 in damages</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada after determining that his imprisonment violated the European Convention on Human Rights. Despite his previous grant of asylum and fears of torture and persecution, UK Law Lords in February 2009 ruled that Qatada <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-rules-muslim-cleric-can-be.php">could be returned</a> [JURIST report] to Jordan to face terrorism charges. The February decision overruled an April 2008 Court of Appeal decision <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-appeals-court-blocks-terror.php">blocking his deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

At <a href="http://www.brecorder.com/world/south-america/93652-top-un-court-to-hear-peru-chile-maritime-dispute.html">issue</a> [AFP report] is a 15,000 square mile triangle of the Pacific Ocean, which Chile currently controls. Bolivia also plans to send a delegation to the ICJ and plans its own lawsuit against Chile. A decision by the 15-judge panel is not expected until mid-2013 at the earliest, and it cannot be appealed once issued. 

<p>The decision by the ICJ will be the latest in a series of decisions resolving border disputes and the outcome could have broad repercussions in the region.

The attack took place approximately 40 miles off the coast of Somalia. While domestic legislation dictates that Somalia's territorial waters extend 200 miles from shore, the prosecution argued that Somalia had signed a <a href="http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201833/volume-1833-A-31363-English.pdf">treaty</a> [text, PDF] establishing that the "breadth of its territorial sea" would "not [exceed] 12 nautical miles." Judge Rebecca Beach Smith thereby denied the defense's motion to have the murder charges dismissed. Each man could face the death penalty if convicted.

<p>Last month the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-piracy-off-somalia-coast.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] piracy and acts of armed robbery against vessels off the coast of Somalia. The Security Council urged the international community to develop a comprehensive response to discourage these acts. A number of countries around the world have taken actions in the attempt to solve the problem of maritime piracy. In October the <a href="http://justiz.hamburg.de/oberlandesgericht/">Hanseatic Higher Regional Court of Hamburg</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/germany-court-convicts-10-somali-pirates.php">sentenced 10 Somalis</a> [JURIST report] who were involved in the hijacking the German freighter MS Taipan off the coast of Somalia two years ago. Also in October, an appeals court in Kenya concluded that <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/kenya-appeals-court-allows-jurisdiction-over-international-piracy-cases.php">Kenyan courts have jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to try international piracy suspects. Also that month six <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/accused-somali-pirates-face-trial-in-paris-court-for-hostage-incident.php">accused Somali pirates went on trial</a> [JURIST report] in a Paris court in connection with the 2008 hijacking of the cruise ship Le Ponant in the Gulf of Aden.  In July the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/icc/imb">International Maritime Bureau</a> [official website] reported that the number of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/international-maritime-bureau-reports-global-piracy-down-by-half-in-2012.php">global pirate attacks fell sharply</a> [JURIST report] in the first half of 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">hurriedly approved</a> [JURIST report] on Friday in anticipation of the hearing, and on Saturday, Morsi set December 15 as the date of the referendum. While tens of thousands of moderate and conservative Islamists have voiced support for the constitution, thousands of other liberal and secular protestors have decried it since Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-vastly-expands-powers-prompting-protests.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST report] in November vastly expanding his powers.

<p>Egypt has endured political turmoil since its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST feature] last year. Earlier this week, Egyptian courts <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-courts-suspend-work-to-protest-presidential-decree.php">suspended work</a> [JURIST report] to protest Morsi's recent decree, which, most significantly, removed judicial review of his actions. In October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-urged-to-amend-draft-constitution-comply-with-international-treaties-hrw.php">amend its proposed constitution</a> [JURIST report] to comply with international treaties. In August, a lawyer in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-lawyer-challenges-morsi-declaration.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging a declaration by Morsi granting himself <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">complete legislative and executive power</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in as president</a>, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolving parliament after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Days before its dissolution, the Egyptian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-court-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-political-isolation-law.php">elected a new constitutional council</a> after lawmakers finally <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-reaches-agreement-on-constitutional-panel.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST reports] on the political composition of the council.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While visiting the city of Abidjan, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ABOUTUS/Pages/ASG.aspx">Ivan Simonovic</a> [official profile] met with area officials to discuss the delayed investigatory process that has followed in the wake of a 2011 attack on the city of Nahibly. Local officials cite the country's delicate security situation and fear of reprisals as the reasons for the extended investigations of offenses including unresolved land disputes and illicit arm circulation by Dozos, a paramilitary group of hunters. This trip marks the first visit by the UN to the Ivory Coast since <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-orders-relocation-of-ivory-coast-staff/2011/04/03/AF57kiXC_story.html">April 2011</a> [WP article] during the tense atmosphere following violence spurred by political elections. 

<p>The Ivory Coast has already begun the process of prosecuting human rights offenders for the crimes that occurred following the country's 2010 elections. In November the International Criminal Court unsealed an <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-charges-wife-of-ivory-coasts-ex-president.php">arrest warrant for Simone Gbagbo</a> [JURIST report], the wife of former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo. Also in November, Laurent Gbagbo was found <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-finds-ivory-coast-ex-president-fit-to-stand-trial-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] before the ICC. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] has also released a report that said the Ivory Coast's military <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/hrw-ivory-coast-military-committed-abuse-torture.php">committed widespread human rights abuses</a> in August and September. In 2011 the Ivory Coast's government launched a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ivory-coast-initiates-post-election-violence-reconciliation-commission.php">truth and reconciliation commission</a> [JURIST report] to resolve conflicts stemming from violence that occurred during the country's tense post-election atmosphere.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] heard <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_12-03-12.pdf">arguments</a> [day call, PDF] in <a href = "/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-takes-10-more-cases-for-2012-term.php">two cases</a> [JURIST report] Monday. The first case, <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1059.pdf">Genesis HealthCare Corp. v. Symczyk</a> [transcript, PDF], concerned whether an issue at the center of a lawsuit is moot if an offer is made to settle with the potential plaintiff. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (FRCP) <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_68">68</a> [text] encourages settling suits in Federal court 14 days before they go to trial and allows offers to stand for 14 days before they are considered "withdrawn." Some courts have interpreted this rule, coupled with <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [text] of the Constitution, to mean that if a defendant makes an offer that fully covers the damages the plaintiff was suing for, even if the plaintiff does not accept the offer, the issue in the suit is moot. However, in this case, the plaintiff, Laura Symczyk, did not accept because she was joined by a group of plaintiffs in the suit, and the defendant, <a href = "http://www.genesishcc.com/">Genesis Healthcare Corp.</a> [corporate website] moved for a mootness determination before she could certify her group as a class. The attorney for Genesis argued that the defendant is allowed to make this effort to settle the claim, and as the offer included a liability judgment, the other plaintiffs would be free to make claims that would then be decided on the merits of their individual cases. Symczyk's counsel argued that not only did FRCP 68 not require mootness if a complete offer was made, a full offer to satisfy her injury was never made. He conceded, in agreement with the Solicitor General, that a full acceptance of an offer could require summary judgment.<blockquote>We think that, just like the Solicitor General, we think that in that circumstance it is possible for the court to enter a default judgment and force relief upon the plaintiff. [...] I think it could work either way so long as the forcing happened within the time period of Rule 68. I don't think the court can, like Lazarus, raise this after it has already been withdrawn. The text of Rule 68 says the offer is now dead. If they had, I imagine, moved for the court to enforce that order, enforce that offer and enter a default judgment within the 14-day period, then I think that would have been something that might have been possible to do.</blockquote>The Solicitor General argued briefly in support of Symczyk: "Respondent has never been compensated for her individual damage claim, nor has she received a court judgment favorably adjudicating that claim. It follows that her individual claim remains live, as does this collective action. More generally, a settlement offer does not moot a claim if it is not accepted. Individual freedom of contract is basic to our legal system, and mutual assent is always a necessary element for any settlement. Rule 68 embodies those principles."

<p>The court also heard <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-338.pdf">arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] on the <a href = "http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/cwa.cfm?program_id=45">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [materials], in the consolidated cases <span class="casename">Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center</span> and <span class="casename">Georgia-Pacific West v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center</span>. The <a href = "http://law.lclark.edu/centers/northwest_environmental_defense_center/">Northwest Environmental Defense Center</a> (NEDC) [advocacy website] sued several logging companies under the CWA's citizen-suit provision, alleging that man-made logging roads were channeling discharge and stormwater into open waters. Whereas they described these as "point sources," which the CWA prohibits, the logging companies, joined by the government, argued that they were natural runoff. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the NEDC, and the <A href = "http://www.oregon.gov/ODF/Pages/about_us.aspx">Oregon Department of Forestry</a> [official website] and <a href = "http://www.gp.com/index.html">Georgia-Pacific West</a> [corporate website] appealed to the Supreme Court. They argued that the <a href = "http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] and its treatment of storm waters allows a clear reversal. Chief Justice Roberts began arguments by congratulating the counsel for petitioners on "getting almost all the relief they're looking for under the new rule issued on Friday." Congress has prepared <a href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=155693">several pieces of legislation</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to support the logging industry and the EPA distributed a <a href = "http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/forestroads.cfm">new rule</a> [press release] clarifying the issue. The NEDC asked that the court dismiss the case as improvidently granted, in light of congressional and EPA reaction. Justice Stephen Breyer recused himself from considering the case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This came just three days after Ericsson <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ericsson-files-suit-against-samsung-for-patent-infringement.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung in the <a href="http://www.txed.uscourts.gov/index.shtml">US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas</a> [official website] for patent infringement. Ericsson claims that Samsung violated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1337">19 USC &#167; 1337</a> [text], which prohibits the importation or sale in the US of products which infringe patents. Ericsson alleges that Samsung violated eleven of Ericsson's patents that involve radio frequency receiver technology, wireless communication device design, user interface technology, modulation technology and standardized communication protocols, such as LTE or WiFi standards. The patents at issue are considered <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/12/ericsson-steps-up-patent-enforcement.html">standard-essential</a> [FOSS Patents report] and thus critical to Samsung's devices. Ericsson further alleges that Samsung violated the fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing practices Samsung had agreed to with its own standard-essential patents.

<p>Samsung has been involved in numerous patent infringement lawsuits, especially with <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website]. Earlier this month, a judge for the US <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] ruled that Apple and Samsung may each pursue additional patent infringement claims against the other, allowing each company to add devices brought to market after the original lawsuit was filed in February. In October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month, a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. In the same time frame Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a Tokyo District Court ruling which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of October, the US <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product. Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Some experts have indicated the invasive species could consume enough plankton to disrupt the food chain, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/video/beware-asian-carp-invasion-12329740">damaging the multi-billion dollar fishing industry</a> [ABC News video]. The court <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/judge-threatens-to-dismiss-asian-carp-suit-unless-states-amend-claims-against-government/2012/12/03/7582ffbe-3daa-11e2-8a5c-473797be602c_story.html">recognized the potential ecological harm</a> [AP report] that could result from the invasive fish species but held that federal law requires that connections between navigable waterways must be kept open and dams can only be constructed with Congress' consent. The court permitted the five states to bring further action if they could craft a remedy which would not require the US Army Corp of Engineers and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District to violate federal law.

<p>The US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-asian-carp.php">denied a petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the five states' Asian carp suit for the fourth time in February.

The Supreme Court had <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/26/asian-carp-supreme-court_n_551798.html">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [AP report] on the issue three times as of April 2010. In December 2009, the state of Michigan filed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/michigan-sues-illinois-in-supreme-court.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the Supreme Court against the state of Illinois seeking to close the two waterways, as the court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the states. All three times, the court denied <em>certiorari</em> without comment on the dispute. Michigan reopened the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/12-21-09_Carp_Fact_Sheet_305177_7.pdf">longstanding controversy</a> [backgrounder, PDF] over the diversion canal, created in the 1890s to keep Chicago's sewage from flowing into Lake Michigan. The court issued decrees over the canal in 1930, 1933, 1956, 1967 and 1980. The carp have been traveling up the Mississippi and Illinois rivers for years. Tests have showed that the carp may have gotten through an underwater electric barrier and may now be within six miles of Lake Michigan. The fish were originally imported to control algae in fisheries on the Mississippi River, but escaped during a 1990s flood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Crepeau said that a large number of migrants are stuck in Greece with little possibility of returning home and little chance of economic and social assimilation due to the country's current financial crisis and employment issues. The Special Rapporteur criticized systemic violence and discrimination against migrants and urged law enforcement to take a greater interest in investigating such conduct. He also expressed concern about Greece's new policy of detaining all irregular migrants found entering the country. 

<p>Recently, many human rights groups and organizations have taken issue with Greece's laws and policies governing the treatment of migrants. In July <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report entitled "Hate on the Streets: Xenophobic Violence in Greece," documenting <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-report-migrants-in-greece-face-violence-discrimination.php">instances of abuse and discrimination</a> [JURIST report] against migrants who traveled Greece seeking refuge from war-torn homelands.

The judges <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/03/us-srilanka-impeachment-idUSBRE8B216C20121203">issued a statement</a> [Reuters report] in which they rejected an 11-member committee appointed by Parliament Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, the elder brother of the President <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1957266,00.html">Mahendra Rajapaksa</a> [<em>Time</em> profile], to investigate the claims made by Rajapaksa's ruling party in an impeachment motion filed against the cheif justice last month. The government has accused <a href="http://supremecourt.lk/index.php/component/content/article/174.html">Shirani Bandaranayake</a> [official profile], Sri Lanka's first female head of the Supreme Court, of overstepping her authority. The judges declared that the impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice Bandaranayake should be impartial and transparent, stating that it is unjust for an inquiry into the impeachment claims to be conducted by the parties who brought the allegations. The judges also voiced concern regarding defamatory media statements against the chief justice and the judiciary that could damage the rule of the law in the country.

<p>The impeachment of Bandaranayake sparked heavy criticism among Sri Lanka's citizens. Last month the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-ensure-safety-of-judiciary.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sri Lanka to take appropriate measures to protect the country's judiciary from threats, intimidation and physical attacks. Earlier last month hundreds of Sri Lankan lawyers and citizens <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-lawyers-protest-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] on the street in Colombo calling the government to halt to the impeachment. Tension continues to grow between the Sri Lankan government and the judiciary after an outspoken judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/sri-lanka-judges-lawyers-protest-assault-of-outspoken-judge.php">was assaulted in October</a> [JURIST report]. Sri Lanka is still struggling to establish rule of law in the wake of a 26-year civil war that ended in 2009. In July the government of Sri Lanka said that it may take up to five years to prosecute people <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">accused of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder]. Earlier in July <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Sri Lanka to stop <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its detailed report <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/010/2012/en/5c85d728-a9ab-4693-afe9-edecc2b8670e/mde310102012en.pdf">"Conflict in Yemen: Abyan's Darkest Hour"</a> [text, PDF], AI explained that the violence initiated by al Qaeda affiliate Ansar al-Sharia as well as the government response to that violence constituted violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). According to the report:<blockquote>After Ansar al-Shari'a took control of large parts of the governorate of Abyan&#8212;and later expanded to cities in the governorates of Shabwa and al-Bayda&#8212;it ruled with an iron fist and was responsible for a wide set of human rights abuses. These included imposing cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments on alleged criminals, enforcing through threats and intimidation repressive social or religious norms, and detaining and harassing community activists. It also committed crime to finance its operations and imposed restrictions on the operations of schools and hospitals.</blockquote>AI also criticized the Yemeni government for attacking residential areas, obstructing medical care and directing "enforced disappearances" during the conflict. AI urged the Yemeni government to ensure that conduct an impartial investigation and prosecute individuals on both sides who have violated international law. The group also urged the government to give clear instructions to military personnel regarding international humanitarian law and the treatment of prisoners.  

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">Al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] has many active supporters and sub-groups throughout the world. Recently, four men in Califoria were <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/four-california-men-charged-with-terrorist-plot.php">charged with terrorism-related offenses</a> [JURIST report] and for attempting to join al Qaeda. Last October, Egyptian-born Muslim cleric <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/profile/abu-hamza.shtml">Abu Hamza al-Masri</a> [BBC profile] pleaded <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/extradited-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-charges.php">not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 criminal charges, including providing material support to terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. Outside of the US, there have been attempts to bring justice to groups who aid and abet al Qaeda. Earlier in October, an Iraq court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/iraq-court-sentences-us-citizen-to-life-in-prison-for-aiding-al-qaeda.php">sentenced a US citizen to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for financing terrorist attacks by al Qaeda.

Lukic was <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/icty-takes-custody-of-long-sought-war.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in August 2005 and prosecuted as the leader of an ethnic Serb paramilitary group known as the White Eagles. Lukic was <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/milan_lukic_sredoje_lukic/4#acdec">tried</a> [case materials] and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-convicts-bosnian-serb-cousins-of.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on counts of persecution, murder, extermination, cruel treatment, and inhuman acts against Bosnian Muslims. Among his many crimes against humanity, he is most notorious for barricading over 50 Muslim men, women and children inside a house and setting it on fire. Lukic submitted eight appeals against his convictions, but the court rejected almost all aspects of his case and <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/11162">confirmed</a> [press release] that the life sentence would stand.

<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NnCLFKQjeGM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This marks the first time that the Appeals Chamber has ever upheld a life imprisonment sentence. Lukic's cousin, Sredoje Lukic, had his sentence reduced from 30 to 27 years by the same court Tuesday, after being convicted in aiding and abetting his cousin's crimes.</p>

<p>Since its establishment in 1993, the ICTY has indicted 161 people for violations of humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001.

Mental health providers Donald Welch, Anthony Duk and Aaron Bitzer sought to enjoin enforcement of SB 1172 before it goes into effect in January, claiming the law violates their right to freedom of speech under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. Judge William Shubb found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, granting a preliminary injunction limited only to the three plaintiffs:<blockquote>Here, the public has an interest in the protection and mental well-being of minors, and the court does not take lightly the possible harm SOCE may cause minors, especially when forced on minors who did not choose to undergo SOCE. ... Countered against this is the public's interest in preserving First Amendment rights. Given the limited scope and duration of a preliminary injunction in this case, the court has no difficulty in concluding that protecting an individual's First Amendment rights outweighs the public's interest in rushing to enforce an unprecedented law.</blockquote>The plaintiffs were represented by the Christian legal group <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/">Pacific Justice institute</a> (PJI) [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/1/post/2012/12/federal-judge-rules-that-ca-sb1172-violates-free-speech.html">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release].

<p>PJI filed the lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-sexual-orientation-therapy-ban-challenged.php">challenging</a> the bill just days after it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed</a> [JURIST reports] into law by California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] in October. SB 1172 was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">California State Assembly</a> [JURIST report] in August and the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST report] in May. Supporters of the bill, including groups such as <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=5609559">Equality California</a> [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=5609559">American Psychoanalytic Association</a> [advocacy website] assert the reason for legislation is that homosexuality is not and should not be treated as a disease, and efforts to reverse homosexuality have proven to be detrimental to minors. </p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2012/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-habeas-corpus-takings-clause.php">report</a>] on the Federal government's immunity under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/category/keywords/takings_clause">Takings Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment05/">Fifth Amendment</a> [text]. The decision held that the government does not receive automatic immunity under the Takings Clause when creating a temporary flood that damages others' property. The opinion was delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg;<blockquote>There is thus no solid grounding in precedent for setting flooding apart from all other government intrusions on property. And the Government has presented no other persuasive reason to do so. Its primary argument is of the in for a penny, in for a pound genre: reversing the decision below, the Government worries, risks disruption of public works dedicated to flood control. "[E]very passing flood attributable to the government's operation of a flood control project, no matter how brief," the Government hypothesizes, might qualify as a compensable taking. To reject a categorical bar to temporary-flooding takings claims, however, is scarcely to credit all, or even many, such claims. It is of course incumbent on courts to weigh carefully the relevant factors and circumstances in each case, as instructed by our decisions.</blockquote>The case was remanded to the <a href = "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] for determining the case on the merits. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the decision.

<p>The <a href="http://www.agfc.com/Pages/default.aspx">Arkansas Game &#38; Fish Commission</a> brought this action against the federal government, alleging that the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official websites] caused increased flooding on one of its properties, which in turn damaged timber. The commission claims the damaging of timber on its property constituted a taking for which it deserved compensation, and the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] agreed and awarded damages of more than $5.6 million. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Arkansas_Game__Fish_Commission_v_United_States_637_F3d_1366_Fed_C">overturned</a> [opinion] that ruling, saying that the flooding did not constitute a taking because it was only temporary and did not permanently take over the land.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-1231.pdf">Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether a 180-day statutory time limit for filing an appeal with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) from a final Medicare payment determination, under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395oo">42 USC &#167; 1395oo(a)(3)</a> [text], is subject to equitable tolling. At attorney for the <a href = "http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS) [official website] argued that in 40 years of Medicare history, the 180-day period has been a hard and fast rule that has never been questioned as being part of the Secretary of HHS rule-making authority. <a href = "http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=428">John Manning</a> [official profile] was then invited to make arguments as court-appointed <em>amicus curiae</em>, and, after having briefed the case, he agreed with the HHS that the statutory time period was absolute. Finally, on behalf of Auburn Regional Medical Center and 18 other hospitals, attorney Robert Roth argued that equitable tolling is appropriate "with intentional concealment, when you have actions by the Secretary, misconduct by the Secretary, that caused the statute of limitations time to be missed." The respondents' position is that the HHS deceived the hospitals from attempting appeals with the PRRB that would have netted reimbursements.<blockquote>The facts that we have here, Your Honor, is that this is really an unprecedented case. This is unprecedented case in Medicare, that we have the agency that says it was doing one thing in a Federal Register document and actually did something different, that then spent years trying to avoid, as was laid out in the Southwest Consulting <em>amicus</em> brief, avoid having those facts come to&#8212;come to&#8212;come to the attention of the providers.</blockquote>The HHS was recently <a href = "/paperchase/2012/11/federal-government-sued-over-privatized-medicare-audits.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] in connection to the use of privatized contractors and their denial of reimbursements to hospitals.

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-460.pdf">Los Angeles County Flood Control District v. Natural Resources Defense Council</a> [transcript, PDF] on the <a href = "http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/cwa.cfm?program_id=45">Clean Water Act</a> [materials]. In question is whether there is discharge or <a href = "http://www.mass.gov/dep/water/laws/stormdef.htm">outfall</a> [backgrounder] when transferring water from one point of a river to another through flood control mechanisms. All parties have agreed that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied the correct rule, but wanted the court to consider different rationales before remanding the case back to the Ninth Circuit. The issue was considered by <a href = "http://www.bbklaw.com/?t=3&A=1704&format=xml">Roderick Walston</a> [official profile] in <A href = "/sidebar/2012/11/roderick-walston-stormwater-epa.php">Supreme Court Should Not Unduly Expand the Scope of the CWA</a> [JURIST comment].</p>]]></content:encoded>

After <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/world/middleeast/nasrin-sotoudeh-iranian-rights-advocate-ends-hunger-strike.html?_r=0">judicial authorities agreed to lift the travel ban</a> [NYT report] on Sotoudeh's daughter, Sotoudeh ended her strike. Sotoudeh was <a href="http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=463457">sentenced</a> [AFP report] in January 2011 to 11 years in prison after being found guilty of "acting against national security" and "making propaganda against the system" for which she will serve five and one years, respectively. The remaining five years of her sentence result from allegations that she was a member of the <a href="http://www.humanrights-ir.org/english/">Human Rights Defenders Center</a> [advocacy website], an organization originally founded by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Shirin+Ebadi">Shirin Ebadi</a> [JURIST news archive] and four other Iranian lawyers, many of whom have also been detained or otherwise punished for their work. In addition to her prison term, Sotoudeh's punishment also requires that she refrain from leaving the country or practicing law for the next 20 years. Sotoudeh has spent a large part of her detention in <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-detained.php">solitary confinement</a> [JURIST report].  

<p>Sotoudeh is most widely known for representing political activists following the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran+election">controversial 2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] and has worked on several high-profile cases. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of <em>mohareb</em>, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Sotoudeh also represented <a href="http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile], a well-known press activist who was <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-court-sentences-outspoken-editor.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to four years in prison in 2006 for publishing articles against the constitution and offending the state media. Iran continues to be scrutinized internationally for human rights violations. In March 2010, Pillay criticized the state of human rights in Iran while presenting her annual report. Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-chief-criticizes-iran-sri.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran for the "arbitrary arrest" of, and "harsh sentences, including capital punishment" given to, individuals involved in protests following the presidential elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Claiming that the challenge to the law is "not likely to prevail" Judge Kimberly Mueller refused the plaintiff's request allowing <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1172_bill_20120416_amended_sen_v97.html">Senate Bill 1172</a> (SB 1172) [text] to go into effect on January 1. The plaintiffs claim that the law violates their right to freedom of speech under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The plaintiffs were represented by the Christian legal group <a href="http://www.lc.org/">Liberty Counsel</a> (LC) [advocacy website],  which announced plans to <a href="http://www.lc.org/index.cfm?PID=14100&PRID=1260">file an emergency appeal</a> [press release] with the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to prevent the law from taking effect.

<p>A separate challenge to SB 1172 resulted in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-blocks-california-law-banning-sexual-orientation-change-therapy.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] by the same court earlier in the week. That challenge, brought by the <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/">Pacific Justice institute</a> (PJI), resulted in a temporary injunction which will allow the plaintiffs in that case to continue SOCE after the law goes into effect. PJI filed the lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-sexual-orientation-therapy-ban-challenged.php">challenging</a> the bill just days after it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed</a> [JURIST reports] into law by California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] in October. SB 1172 was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">California State Assembly</a> [JURIST report] in August and the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST report] in May. Supporters of the bill, including groups such as <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=5609559">Equality California</a> [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=5609559">American Psychoanalytic Association</a> [advocacy website] assert the reason for legislation is that homosexuality is not and should not be treated as a disease, and efforts to reverse homosexuality have proven to be detrimental to minors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addressing the Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights, Pillay detailed the importance of taking steps to implement the <a href="http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-press-release-24-mar-2011.pdf">Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. Pillay specifically addressed the role governments play in the process:<blockquote>Governments must step up to close the governance gaps that have played such a large part in both facilitating and sustaining the current economic crisis, and business must cooperate with government efforts in this regard. Implementation of the Guiding Principles will be a big step in the right direction. ... The Guiding Principles recognize that responsible governance requires the adoption of adequate regulatory and policy frameworks to prevent and remedy business related human rights abuses. There needs to be a recognition also in the proceedings at this Forum that enhancing legal standards in relevant areas, be it at the national, regional or international level, may be necessary to ensure the full and effective implementation of the Guiding Principles. There is a particularly pressing case for such legal developments when it comes to business involvement in gross human rights abuse.</blockquote>Pillay also emphasized that markets have a role to play in protecting human rights. 

<p>Business' effect on human rights is a growing concern in the international community. Last month a UN independent rights experts released a report detailing groups whose <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-human-rights-experts-urge-respect-for-groups-at-risk-from-transnational-business-activities.php">human rights are harmed</a> [JURIST report] by transnational business activities. In July a UN rights body <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-body-concerned-rio20-not-addressing-human-rights-issues.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] that the Rio+20 did not address businesses respecting human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Michael Gordon of the <a href="http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/">Maricopa County Superior Court</a> [official website] rebuffed arguments from Arizona <a href="http://www.azag.gov/">Attorney General Tom Horne</a> [official website] that federal laws barring the use of marijuana preempted the state law allowing medicinal marijuana which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-medical-marijuana-law.php">passed by referendum</a> [JURIST report] in 2010. The case was brought by the White Mountain Health Center which had been denied zoning permission by Maricopa County officials who claimed that federal prohibition on marijuana prevented state employees from issuing licenses to dispensaries as they would be enabling the commission of federal crimes. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website], which had joined the plaintiffs in this case, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/criminal-law-reform/arizona-judge-upholds-voter-approved-medical-marijuana-act">welcomed the news</a> [press release] claiming "the regulation of drugs and medicine is traditionally a power exercised by the states, and the Constitution allows Arizona and the federal government to make different policy choices in these arenas." The decision gave the state 10 days to comply with the order and begin issuing licenses to qualified dispensaries. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] was a hot-button issue in several states in the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">November 6 election</a> [JURIST report]. In Washington voters <a href="http://sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/initiatives/i502.pdf">approved an initiative</a> [Initiative 502, PDF] to allow the possession and distribution of marijuana through a state-licensing system of marijuana growers, processors and stores, where adults can buy up to an ounce. The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado initiative</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] actually introduces an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and to privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In Oregon the <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">Cannabis Tax Act Initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] failed by <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [Examiner.com report] of the vote. Medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts for the first time as over 60 percent of voters approved <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">Question 3</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF], an indirect initiated statute that will <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">allow marijuana use by patients</a> [Harvard Crimson report] with "debilitating medical conditions" and create 35 medical marijuana dispensaries. Conversely, the <a href="http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/Documents/2012%20Proposed%20Initiatives%20and%20Referenda/Marijuana%20Proposal%20Text%20for%20web.pdf">Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act</a> [Issue 5, PDF] was <a href="http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/232534/2/ISSUE-5-Medical-marijuana-measure-rejected">rejected by voters</a> [AP report] in that state by approximately a 52-to-48 percent margin. The measure would have allowed doctors to issue a certificate to anyone with a "qualifying medical condition" to grow, process and use marijuana. Also on the ballot in Montana is a veto referendum regarding a <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/2011/billhtml/SB0423.htm">2011 revision</a> [SB 423] of a 2004 law that established medical marijuana use in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In April 2011 the <a href="http://fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] adopted the <a href="http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc52169/m1/583/">data roaming rule</a> [order], which allows users to connect to another provider's mobile-data services when they travel outside their own network's coverage area. The purpose of the data roaming rule is to foster competition among providers and "promote consumer access to seamless mobile data coverage nationwide." <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/index.html">Verizon</a> [corporate website] opposed the data roaming rule, arguing that the FCC did not have authority to promulgate a rule for mobile-data providers and that mobile internet service providers could not be considered common carriers. Verizon also suggested that mobile-data providers were already entering into roaming agreements and that a federal regulation was unnecessary. The court concluded that Title III of the <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">Communications Act</a> [text, PDF] provides statutory authority for the FCC to promulgate rules regulating mobile-data providers.

<p>Verizon and other internet and mobile phone service providers have lodged several complaints against federal regulations in recent years. In January 2011 Verizon <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit challenging new <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=net+neutrality">net neutrality</a> [JURIST news archive] rules adopted by the FCC that will allow the government to regulate Internet traffic. Verizon filed its appeal in January 2011 arguing that the net neutrality rules gave the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">more authority than Congress intended to give it</a> [JURIST report]. The FCC <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/fcc-approves-adoption-of-net-neutrality.php">approved the net neutrality rules</a> [JURIST report] in October 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled Sunday that the couple, who were married in Canada and live in Israel, should be recognized as married and <a href="http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=294424">should be allowed to sever the relationship</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report]. Not allowing the separation, the court reasoned, would violate the couple's fundamental rights. The court also decided when the rabbinical courts, which have jurisdiction over divorce hearings, fail to hear an issue, the court may have jurisdiction to rule on the issue. Here, the court recognized that the rabbinical courts should not be expected to rule on same-sex divorces and thus claimed jurisdiction. 

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder], and recently same-sex divorce, remains a controversial issue both in the US and around the globe. In November Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/nigeria-house-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that criminalizes same-sex marriage. That same month, Malawi <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/malawi-changes-position-on-suspension-of-anti-gay-laws.php">changed position</a> [JURIST report] on suspending its anti-homosexuality laws.

Falk concluded a week-long mission evaluating the overall impact of Israel's prolonged occupation and blockade of Gaza. In his statement Falk accused Israel of deliberately targeting civilian targets during the recent conflict, with a disproportionate number of attacks harming and killing civilians in a manner that appears to violate international law. The Special Rapporteur also addressed the pressing need to clarify aspects of the implementation of the cease fire agreement, saying:<blockquote>Every day Palestinian fishermen and farmers risk being shot at or detained by Israeli forces. Already since the agreement was reached, Israel has detained 13 fishermen, confiscated 4 fishing boats and sank another fishing boat. ... Such actions signal an Israeli intention to maintain its coercive style of occupation rather to explore whether implementing the ceasefire agreement might lead toward a more hopeful future.</blockquote>Falk urged for sustained pressure by the international community on Israel, viewing world-wide support of the recent General Assembly resolution that made Palestine a non-Member observer State a foundation for a concerted international effort to protect Palestinian rights. According to Falk if significant underlying problems in Gaza, including lack of fresh water and sanitation, crumbling infrastructure and deficient investment, all exacerbated by the Israeli blockade and occupation, are not addressed, it appears that, by 2020, Gaza may be uninhabitable.

<p>The most recent conflict in Gaza has raised concern of possible human rights violations committed by Israel. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-israel-to-avoid-civilian-targets.php">pressured</a> [JURIST report] Israel to avoid strikes on civilian structures in Gaza, expressing acute concern over the surge in the number of Palestinian civilian deaths in November. Also, in response to the rising civilian death toll and the dozens of Gazan schools and religious sites damaged by the bombings, <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [official website] said that children in Gaza were suffering from severe psycho-social distress that refrain them from sleeping, going out in public and engaging in social activities.  In August <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/israel-urged-to-investigate-mistreatment-of-palestinian-detainees.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its treatment of Palestinian detainees, alleging that two had been mistreated. In June the UN also urged Israel to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-aid-groups-urge-israel-to-end-gaza-blockade.php">end its blockade</a> [JURIST report] of the Gaza Strip, alleging that it was violating international law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontoklahoma.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Oklahoma Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday struck down two state laws, <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2012/110813.html">HB 2780</a> and <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/2012/110765.html">HB 1970</a> [opinions], limiting abortion rights for physicians and patients for unconstitutionality. The <a href="http://www.ecapitol.net/viewtext.wcs?HB2780_INT~52nd">first law</a> [HB 2780 text] mandated that physicians must require that any patient seeking an abortion undergo an ultra-sound, whereby the image of the fetus was to be described and placed in direct view of the patient. The law was first challenged in federal court in 2010 in <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/Order%20of%20Okla%20Sup%20Ct%203-02-10.pdf">Nova Health Systems v. Pruitt</a> [order, PDF], and the court enjoined enforcement of the bill in holding that it interfered with patients' and physicians' rights to make decisions regarding medical treatment. The <a href="http://e-lobbyist.com/gaits/text/287092">second law</a> [HB 1970 text] was first challenged in federal court in 2011 in <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/Complaint_Oklahomans_for_Reproductive_Justice.PDF">Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice v. Terry Cline</a> [complaint, PDF]. The law imposed broad and stringent limitations on physicians when prescribing abortion-inducing medications to patients, and banned the prescription of "off-label" drugs known to have abortion-inducing effects even when used to treat ectopic pregnancies. The lower court held that the law infringed upon women's constitutional reproductive rights and interfered with doctor's abilities to provide safe and efficacious treatment to patients. After appeal, the Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday affirmed both decisions and effectively abrogated the laws in holding that both violated federal constitutional law pursuant to a 1992 US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruling in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [materials, PDF]. The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [advocacy website] called the laws "intrusive" and <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/oklahoma-supreme-court-rules-two-anti-abortion-rights-laws-unconstitutional">praised</a> [press release] the court's decisions. However, Oklahoma <a href="http://www.oag.state.ok.us/oagweb.nsf/profile.html">Attorney General Scott Pruitt</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.oag.state.ok.us/oagweb.nsf/0/3D15F4F2F1F6177386257ACA007910DB!OpenDocument">took issue</a> [press release] with the decisions, especially the abrogation of HB 1970: <blockquote>We disagree with the court&#8217;s decision ... There is overwhelming evidence that the off-label use of abortion-inducing drugs leads to serious infections and death for many healthy, unsuspecting women. This is not OK. Our job is to protect the citizens of Oklahoma ...</blockquote>Pruitt, who appealed the district court decisions in <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/oklahoma-ag-appeals-ruling-against-abortion-drug-restrictions.php">early</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/oklahoma-ag-appeals-ruling-invalidating-ultrasound-bill.php">late</a> June [JURIST reports], also stated that his office is considering an appeal to the US Supreme Court.

<p>Oklahoma has been at the center of controversy recently regarding <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The Oklahoma law restricting the use of abortion-inducing drugs was scheduled to take effect on November 1, 2011, but was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/oklahoma-judge-blocks-new-law-restricting-use-of-abortion-pills.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] in October. In April 2011 Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks. The law allows abortions past the 20-week mark only in certain extenuating circumstances where the mother faces death or serious injury. A doctor who performs an abortion in violation of the time limit would be subject to criminal prosecution for a felony, but the woman undergoing the procedure would not face a penalty. Last year an Oklahoma state judge extended a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/oklahoma-court-blocks-requiring-pre-abortion-ultrasounds.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking enforcement of HB 2780.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Oklahoma <a href="http://www.oag.state.ok.us/oagweb.nsf/">Attorney General Scott Pruitt</a> [official website] had filed a suit in January against the federal health care law arguing that "Congress had exceeded its Article I powers by enacting the Act's minimum coverage provision. The Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the US Department of Treasury principally claimed that Oklahoma lacks standing to bring suit and asked the court to dismiss the case. The reason underlying this argument was the principle that citizens of a state are also citizens of the US and therefore, a "State does not have standing as a <em>parens patriae</em> to bring an action on behalf of its citizens against the federal government because the federal government is presumed to represent the State's citizens." The attorneys condemned Oklahoma for its attempt to deny its citizens rights to which they are entitled under federal law. They estimated that around 38,000 Oklahoma citizens will benefit from the premium tax credits under the PPACA. 

<p>In September Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/oklahoma-ag-amends-lawsuit-challenging-health-care-law.php">amended</a> [JURIST report] its <a href="http://www.oag.state.ok.us/oagweb.nsf/0/ac5276feb11b775586257a7e006f7025/$FILE/Amended%20Complaint%20(File%20Stamped).pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] following the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in June holding that the PPACA is <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report], interpreting the government-imposed fees for individuals who fail to purchase health insurance as a tax rather than a criminal penalty. In maintaining the constitutional challenge, the new complaint added a challenge to the new IRS regulations that were put in place to carry out the law. Oklahoma argued that the Supreme Court's interpretation does not preempt a 2010 amendment to the <a href="http://oklegal.onenet.net/okcon/">Oklahoma Constitution</a> [text] ensuring that Oklahoma citizens cannot be compelled by government to purchase health insurance. In July AG Pruitt filed a motion asking the federal court to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/oklahoma-ag-asks-court-to-permit-health-care-law-challenge.php">lift a stay on the state's challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the federal health care law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 2-1 decision issued in August, the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/us-appeals-court-rejects-graphic-cigarette-label-requirement.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the regulations, holding that the FDA's rule on graphic cigarette label warnings exceeded the agency's statutory authority and undermined tobacco companies' economic autonomy. In the previous opinion one judge dissented, arguing that the government has a strong interest in conveying information on cigarette packages to consumers about the health risks of smoking. The government as 90 days to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-12-05/news-summary-court-wont-rehear-cigarette-case">appeal the case</a> [AP report] to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>In March the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the graphic cigarette label warnings are constitutional.

Chafin</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-foreign-custody-dispute-case.php">report</a>], an international child custody dispute. The court will decide whether a parent can appeal in a custody suit when a district court has determined the child's habitual residence is another country and the child has already been removed from the US, or whether the issue has become moot, taking away any cause of action. The issue in this case stems from a custody dispute between US Army Sergeant Jeffrey Lee Chafin and his Scottish wife, Lynn Chafin. A district court ruled that, under the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</a> [text], their child's habitual place of residence was Scotland, so Mrs. Chafin moved there and took the child with her.  The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Chafin_v_Chafin_No_1115355CC_2012_BL_231213_11th_Cir_Feb_06_2012_">ruled</a> [order] earlier this year to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was moot. An attorney for Mr. Chafin argued that the appeal is not moot because there are still ways that Mr. Chafin can be afforded relief from US courts. He said the court could overturn the district court's ruling, reverse monetary awards that were given, order Mrs. Chafin and the child to return to the US, and continue court hearings in Alabama while causing current proceedings in Scotland to be dismissed. An attorney for the US also argued in support of Mr. Chafin. An attorney for Mrs. Chafin argued that an appeal would be moot at this point because an appeals order would mean nothing to Scottish courts, which have already begun custody proceedings. He said the appeals decision would come so late that, even if it decided the district court was wrong at the time of the first ruling and the child's habitual residence was the US, the Scottish court would likely still find that the child's habitual residence is now Scotland since the child has been living there since that ruling.

<p>The Hague Convention, which has been ratified by <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&cid=24">88 states</a> [signatories, text], seeks to eliminate difficulties arising from custody disputes between parents of different nationalities, specifically problems occurring when courts refuse to recognize decisions of foreign courts. The US Supreme Court recently took on another case dealing with the Hague Convention, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-645.pdf">Abbott v. Abbott</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-rules-on-parental-rights-in-international-child-custody-case.php">report</a>], which presented the issue of whether a <em>ne exeat</em> clause, which prohibits one parent from removing the child from the country without the other parent's consent, confers a "right of custody," which would require the other country to return the child if the clause was broken. The Supreme Court ruled that it did confer a "right of custody" within the meaning of the Hague Convention, reversing a lower court ruling on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In November Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/nigeria-house-approves-bill-criminalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that criminalizes same-sex marriage.

The DOJ announced that the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) [text] still lists marijuana as an illegal substance, regardless of how state laws classify the drug. In the press release the DOJ also emphasized that the CSA is still the controlling law in Washington state because states do not have power to overrule a federal law:<blockquote>The Department of Justice is reviewing the legalization initiatives recently passed in Colorado and Washington State. The Department's responsibility to enforce the Controlled Substances Act remains unchanged. Neither States nor the Executive branch can nullify a statute passed by Congress. In enacting the Controlled Substances Act, Congress determined that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance.</blockquote>It remains to be seen to what extent the federal government will crack down on marijuana possession in Colorado and Washington state. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marijuana">Marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] was a hot-button issue in several states in the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/jurist-marijuana-will-become-legal.php">November 6 election</a> [JURIST report], as Washington and Colorado legalized marijuana. The <a href="http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Initiatives/titleBoard/filings/2011-2012/30Final.pdf">Colorado initiative</a> [Amendment 64, PDF] actually introduces an amendment to the state constitution, allowing adults over 21 to possess up to an ounce and privately grow up to six plants, although public use will be banned. In Oregon the <a href="http://oregonvotes.org/irr/2012/009cbt.pdf">Cannabis Tax Act Initiative</a> [Measure 80, PDF] <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/although-measure-80-failed-marijuana-has-won-even-oregon">failed by approximately 55-to-45 percent</a> [Examiner.com report] of the vote. Medical marijuana was legalized in Massachusetts for the first time as over 60 percent of voters approved <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/docs/government/2011-petitions/11-11.pdf">Question 3</a> [Petition 11-11, PDF], an indirect initiated statute that will <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/11/7/mass-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">allow marijuana use by patients</a> [Harvard Crimson report] with "debilitating medical conditions" and create 35 medical marijuana dispensaries. Conversely, the <a href="http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/Documents/2012%20Proposed%20Initiatives%20and%20Referenda/Marijuana%20Proposal%20Text%20for%20web.pdf">Arkansas Medical Marijuana Act</a> [Issue 5, PDF] was <a href="http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/232534/2/ISSUE-5-Medical-marijuana-measure-rejected">rejected by voters</a> [AP report] in that state by approximately a 52-to-48 percent margin. The measure would have allowed doctors to issue a certificate to anyone with a "qualifying medical condition" to grow, process and use marijuana.

The defendant was arrested after police observed him participating in an apparent drug transaction, and, upon being booked the police seized his cell phone. From the defendant's phone police found numerous calls had been placed to the other party to the drug deal. The trial court ruled that the search of the phone was covered by the search incident to arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, which permits "searching for weapons, instruments of escape, and evidence of crime when a person is taken into official custody and lawfully detained." Phifer appealed claiming cell phones are "inherently different" from other items a person may be carrying at the time of an arrest because of the "telephone's capacity to store vast quantities of private information." Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Botsford upheld the search:<blockquote>Officer Fontanez had seen the defendant using the cellular telephone just before the observed drug transaction between the defendant and Claiborne took place; the police recognized Claiborne as a drug user and recovered cocaine from Claiborne; and Detective McCarthy testified that based on his experience, telephones are commonly used in the trug trade. Thus, the search of the call list in this case was a valid search incident to arrest.</blockquote>The court handed down a similar ruling the same day in the case of <a href="http://www.universalhub.com/2012/commonwealth-vs-christopher-y-berry">Commonwealth v. Berry</a> [opinion], which also involved a search incident to arrest of a cellular phone. In both cases the court ruled only on the facts of those particular cases and declined to rule on whether a cellphone seized incident to arrest may always be searched without a warrant.

<p>Issues surrounding communications privacy and police use of technology have become controversial over the past several years in light of technological advancements. Last month, the Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/Senate-committee-approves-bill-requiring-warrant-to-search-emails.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require police officers to obtain a warrant before searching e-mails and other electronic content. Earlier this year, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-jones/">reversed</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-gps-tracking-of-vehicle-constitutes-search.php">report</a>] a drug trafficking conviction after police obtained evidence to convict the defendant by attaching a GPS tracking device to his car. In 2007, the Supreme Court <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2007/06/us-appeals-court-rules-against.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that warrantless searches of e-mails stored by an Internet Service Provider violates the Fourth Amendment because email users maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/4ae9bede9.html">African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa</a> (Kampala Convention) [text, PDF] was passed in 2009 and came into full enforcement on Thursday. It is the world's first set of guidelines for the protection of individuals who are displaced within their own country. Other conventions have been passed throughout the world protecting refugees who have been forced out of their home countries due to violent conflict or natural disasters, but they did not deal with IDPs. In his statement, the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of IDPs Chaloka Beyani outlined the importance of the Kampala Convention:<blockquote>Out of the 26 million persons internally displaced due to conflict or human rights violence in 2011, an estimated 10 million were in Africa, with at least a further half million internally displaced due to sudden onset natural disasters, such as floods. ... However, I believe that the significance of the Kampala Convention goes beyond Africa&#8212;as an international model this comprehensive Convention represents the culmination of over two decades of work during which Governments, civil society and the international community have sought to improve the way we address the plight of millions of internally displaced persons across the globe.</blockquote>The Kampala convention has been signed by 37 member states of the AU. Beyani urged the remaining members of the AU to consider signing the historic convention to ensure the protection of IDPs throughout Africa. 

<p>In July the AU <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/african-union-to-consider-creating-criminal-court.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will vote on whether to establish a continental criminal court to try human rights crimes. The African Court on Human and People's Rights (ACHPR) currently does not have jurisdiction to try criminals and asked the AU to pass a resolution granting it the authority to sentence human rights criminals. Last year, <a href="http://au.int/en/commission">African Union Commission</a> (AUC) [official website] Chairperson Jean Ping had <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/au-official-accuses-icc-chief-prosecutor-of-double-standards.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] former chief prosecutor of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website], Luis Moreno-Ocampo, of targeting African citizens for prosecution. The accusation came amid a vote by Africa's foreign ministers, who supported Kenya's bid to defer the trials of numerous suspects who allegedly planned the <a href="http://www.trust.org/alertnet/crisis-centre/crisis/kenya-violence?v=in_detail">2007 post-election violence</a> [Reuters backgrounder]. In 2010 the Kenyan Parliament approved a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/kenya-lawmakers-approve-motion-to-withdraw-from-icc.php">withdraw the country from the ICC</a> [JURIST report]. The vote came a week after Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/icc-prosecutor-accuses-6-kenyans-of-orchestrating-2007-post-election-violence.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] cases against six individuals believed to be responsible for the 2007 post-election violence that resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum gave Washington voters the choice to accept or reject the state <a href="http://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/r074.pdf">same-sex marriage legislation</a> [SB 6239, PDF], which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by the governor in February. Opponents of the law <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">conceded defeat</a> [JURIST report] last month after the vote count indicated that the measure to legalize same-sex marriage finally passed with approximately <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/results/current/Referendum-Measure-No-74-Concerns-marriage-for-same-sex-couples_ByCounty.html">52.55 percent</a> [materials] of the statewide vote. Gregoire indicated on Wednesday that same-sex couples would be able to obtain marriage licenses in the state within a few hours of her certification of the results. With Maine and Maryland, the results made Washington the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">third state</a> [JURIST report] to legalize same-sex marriage through referendum last month, and the ninth state overall, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports]. 

<p>In June <a href="http://preservemarriagewashington.com/threat.php">Preserve Marriage Washington</a> [advocacy website] presented more than 200,000 referendum signatures to <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/washington-same-sex-marriage-referendum-to-appear-on-ballot.php">put Referendum 74 on the ballot</a>, submitting the signatures and thus suspending the legislation <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/washington-same-sex-marriage-law-postponed-by-referendum-filing.php">one day before</a> [JURIST reports] the law was scheduled to take effect.

In his dual capacity as President of the ICTY and the <a href="www.unmict.org/">Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals</a> (MICT) [official website], Judge <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ls/meron_bio.pdf">Theodor Meron</a> [official profile, PDF] <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/11166">discussed</a> [press release] how the complexity of the Tribunal's cases and its reliance on state cooperation with evidence requests have delayed preparation of its judgments. He estimates, though, that all appellate work will be complete by the end of 2014 with the help of the MICT, which will finish all ICTY and ICTR tasks after their mandates expire. Overall, Meron urged the Security Council to acknowledged the legacy that the ICTY will leave for human rights advocacy. This sentiment was echoed by ICTR President <a href="http://www.unictr.org/AboutICTR/ICTRStructure/TheChambers/JudgeVagnJoensen/tabid/151/Default.aspx">Vagn Joensen</a> [official profile], who declared that the transition from the ICTR to MICT's branch in the northern Tazanian town of Arusha has allowed the tribunal to focus more on downsizing its activities in preparation for closure. Like Meron, Joensen also proffered that the ICTR's work would be complete by the end of 2014.

<p>Since its establishment in 1993, the ICTY has indicted 161 people for violations of humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001. Similarly, since its founding in 1994 following the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder], the ICTR has indicted 91 individuals and, thus far, finished 50 trials with 29 convictions. Earlier this month, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/icty-upholds-life-sentence-for-bosnian-serb-commander.php">upheld the life sentence of Milan Lukic</a> [JURIST report], a Bosnian Serb commander who was sentenced to life in prison for crimes that include burning more than 100 people alive during the 1992 Bosnian War. In November, the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/war-crimes-tribunal-acquits-former-kosovo-liberation-army-commander.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] former Kosovo Liberation Army commanders Ramush Haradinaj, Idriz Balaj, and Laji Brahimaj of war crimes related to abduction and torture of civilians. Also in November, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-overturns-convictions-of-two-croatia-generals.php">overturned the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of two Croat generals for crimes against humanity and war crimes against Serb civilians committed during a 1995 military blitz. The ICTR, on the other hand, has been occupied with transfers. In July, the tribunal transferred four genocide convicts <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/ictr-transferred-genocide-convicts-to-prison.php">to the Republic of Mali</a> [JURIST report] to serve their sentences. A month earlier, the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-transfers-case-to-national-court.php">transferred  the case of Aloys Ndimbati</a> [JURIST report], a former local government official in Rwanda who has been charged with genocide, complicity in genocide, incitement to commit genocide, and crimes against humanity including murder, rape, and persecution, to the authorities of the Republic of Rwanda. Earlier in the month, <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ictr-transfers-fifth-case-to-rwandan-court.php">Bernard Munyagishari's case was the fifth to be transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the country's court system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iecoRlkalwOUUC_P751EdI8E-PbQ?docId=1d866fac8c7045dda68c49dafaf804fb">Abhisit may have been liable</a> [AP report] for the death of a civilian cab driver because he allowed troops enforcing the crackdown to use live ammunition against demonstrators. The DSI explained that other factors have contributed to the decision to charge the country's former leader, including the military's continued use of force over an extended period of time and the killing of civilians without resorting to a lesser means of controlling protesters. Abhisit and former deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban, the man who established the security agencies to contain the protests, are expected to be summoned and formally charged on December 12. 

<p>Thailand's political system has been unstable since the <a href="http://thailand.ahrchk.net/docs/AHRC_Thailand_Coup_2006.pdf">2006 military coup</a> [AHRC backgrounder, PDF] by the Royal Thai Army against then-prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile], and the Bangkok crackdown has only exacerbated the instability. Following democratic party defeats in 2011, <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/245369/abhisit-quits-as-democrat-leader">Abhisit resigned</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] as prime minister.

Brewer's order denies driver's licenses for immigrants participating in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The DACA provides a two-year period where young immigrants are not threatened with deportation if they abide by certain requirements, obtain a work permit and receive a Social Security Number. The ACLU argues that the Arizona order will make it difficult for young immigrants to actively participate in the work force and in their communities. The complaint alleges that Brewer's order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution by interfering with federal immigration policy. The complaint states:<blockquote>As part of its immigration power, the federal government has exclusive authority to enact and to enforce regulations concerning which noncitizens to admit, exclude, remove, or allow to remain in the U.S. The federal government also has exclusive authority over the terms and conditions of a noncitizen's stay in the United States. Further, the federal government has exclusive authority to classify noncitizens, which include determining the categories of noncitizens who are granted federal authorization to remain in the United States. In contrast, state governments have none of these powers.</blockquote>The complaint seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the order form implementation and enforcement.

<p>Last month the ACLU filed a class action <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/aclu-files-class-action-lawsuit-over-mandatory-immigrant-detention.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of New Jersey immigrants challenging mandatory detention procedures. The policy in question is <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">8 USC &#167; 1226(c)</a> [text], which mandates the detention of noncitizens during deportation proceedings, and such noncitizens are not entitled to a bond hearing, even if they pose no danger or flight risk. In September the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/ninth-circuit-rejects-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a request for a new injunction against a controversial provision of Arizona's <a href = "http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070, PDF] requiring law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. </p>]]></content:encoded>

According to HRW, the IDF planned and authorized the attack in pursuit of Mohamed Jamal al-Dalu, a suspected Hamas "terror operative" and low-ranking police officer. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/07/israelgaza-israeli-airstrike-home-unlawful">claims</a> [press release] that even if the decedent al-Dalu was a lawful military target, an aerial bombing of a densely populated civilian area for an "insignificant" target is a violation of proportionality principles protecting civilians pursuant to <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/380?OpenDocument">international humanitarian law</a> [IHL text; <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/protected-persons/civilians/overview-civilians-protected.htm">ICRC backgrounder</a>]. HRW elaborated:<blockquote>Under the laws of war, the expected military gain from an attack must outweigh the anticipated military gain. ... Disproportionate attacks are serious violations which Israel has an obligation to investigate. Victims of laws of war violations and their families should be promptly and adequately compensated. Anyone responsible for deliberately or recklessly committing a serious violation of the laws of war should be prosecuted for war crimes ... [and] Israel has not provided any information to support the claim that Mohamed al-Dalu was directly participating in hostilities.</blockquote>Sources have reportedly informed HRW that al-Dalu's police unit was "purely a 'civilian department,'" and his family also stated that, to their knowledge, he was not a member of any Palestinian terror group. However, sources from the IDF have asserted that al-Dalu was a "known terror operative affiliated with the military wing of Hamas." Further, the IDF has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/19/us-palestinians-israel-civilians-idUSBRE8AI0IU20121119">claimed</a> [Reuters report] that military targets are thoroughly investigated before action is taken to ensure that collateral civilian deaths and injuries do not occur. According to HRW, 103 Palestinian civilians and four Israeli civilians were killed in Gaza during armed conflict in November. 

<p>The <a href="/forum/2012/12/laurie-blank-israel-hamas.php">recent conflict in Gaza</a> [JURIST op-ed] has raised concern of possible human rights violations committed by Israel. Earlier this week UN Special Rapporteur Richard Flak <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-expert-calls-on-israel-to-abide-by-gaza-cease-fire.php">called on Israel</a> [JURIST report] to fully implement and continue to support the recent conflict-ending ceasefire agreement with Palestinians in Gaza. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-urges-israel-to-avoid-civilian-targets.php">pressured</a> [JURIST report] Israel to avoid strikes on civilian structures in Gaza. Pillay expressed acute concern over the surge in the number of Palestinian civilians killed and injured as a result of Israeli military action and suggested that allegations of war crimes would depend on the circumstances of each particular attack. Also last month Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi announced that peace talks were progressing toward a ceasefire in the recent escalation of violence in the area and reported that an agreement is close at hand. The ceasefire discussions between Morsi, the Quatari emir, Turkish <correction num=1>Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</correction> and former Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal came a day after Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-rights-chief-calls-for-ceasefire-in-gaza.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] a cessation of the continued indiscriminate attacks and targeting of civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House passed the legislation by a vote of 58-52, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/1206/Michigan-Senate-puts-right-to-work-on-a-fast-track-video">over unanimous Democratic opposition</a> [AP report]. The Senate then approved the legislation by a vote of 22-16, with several Republicans joining Democrats in voting against it. Freedom to Work drew a great deal of controversy not only because of its anti-union implications, but also because it was passed <a href="articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-06/news/sns-rt-us-usa-unions-michiganbre8b5150-20121206_1_union-dues-public-and-private-sector-unions-republican-governor-scott-walker">without any opportunity for the public to weigh in</a> [CNN report].

The legislation applies to both private sector and public sector unions.

<p>Attempts to limit collective bargaining rights have been confronted with heavy opposition. In September the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/statewide/MI.html?SITE=MIDTFELN&SECTION=POLITICS">was defeated 57-43 percent</a> [AP report]. Wisconsin faced a challenge against its legislation which limited the collective bargaining rights of public employee unions. In July the <a href="https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wisconsin-high-court-refuses-to-reopen-collective-bargaining-challenge.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] not to reopen a case challenging the state's <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/jr1_sb11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [text, PDF] because of a justice's refusal to recuse himself. Four votes were needed, but only three justices were in support of reopening the case. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the bill in June 2011 thereby overruling the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">finding</a> [JURIST report] a month earlier that legislators had violated the "open meetings" rule.

Last November Ohio voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-voters-reject-collective-bargaining-law-in-statewide-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bill which would have impacted Ohio's 400,000 public workers by limiting their ability to strike and collectively bargain for health insurance and pensions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">complained</a> [UN News Centre report] that the draft constitution, which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">approved last week</a> [JURIST report], was passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators. Pillay also said that she was concerned about the draft constitution's omission of references to international human rights treaties that Egypt ratified in the past. While Pillay commended the fact that the draft constitution imposes term limits on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] and provides some protections for freedom of expression and religion, she <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/world/middleeast/un-rights-chief-cites-disastrous-situation-in-egypt.html?_r=0">noted</a> [NYT report] that these protections were not strong enough. The draft constitution is scheduled to be put to a referendum vote on December 15.  

<p>Egypt has endured political turmoil since its <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] last year. Last week Egyptian courts <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-courts-suspend-work-to-protest-presidential-decree.php">suspended work</a> [JURIST report] to protest Morsi's recent decree, which, most significantly, removed judicial review of his actions. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-urged-to-amend-draft-constitution-comply-with-international-treaties-hrw.php">amend its proposed constitution</a> [JURIST report] to comply with international treaties. In August a lawyer in Egypt <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-lawyer-challenges-morsi-declaration.php">filed an appeal</a> challenging a declaration by Morsi granting himself <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-president-grants-self-total-executive-and-legislative-powers.php">complete legislative and executive power</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in as president</a>, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolving parliament after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Days before its dissolution, the Egyptian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-court-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-political-isolation-law.php">elected a new constitutional council</a> after lawmakers finally <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-reaches-agreement-on-constitutional-panel.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST reports] on the political composition of the council.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, entitled "Transforming pain into hope: Human rights defenders in the Americas," investigated over 300 reports of abuses of human rights workers in the Americas over the past few years. In a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/americas-human-rights-defenders-increasingly-targeted-and-attacked-2012-12-07">statement</a> [press release] announcing the publication of the report, Nancy Tapias-Torrado, Americas Researcher on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders for AI claimed that "human rights defenders are systematically harassed, attacked and subjected to unfounded criminal charges in almost every country in the Americas to prevent them from speaking out for the rights of the most marginalized." The report itself notes specific areas of human rights workers are especially vulnerable to hostility include "people working on human rights related to land, territory and natural resources; the rights of women, and lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people; and migrant's rights."

<p>Claims of human rights abuses are well established in Central and Latin America. In September UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-urges-honduras-to-address-violence-against-lawyers.php">encouraged Honduras</a> [JURIST report] to respond to increasing violence levied against lawyers. Also in September Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-high-commissioner-asks-venezuela-to-stay-in-human-rights-court.php">urged Venezuela</a> [JURIST report] to remain active in furthering the American Convention on Human Rights. In May Brazil's Truth Commission was <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/brazil-truth-commission-sworn-in-to-investigate-human-rights-abuses.php">sworn in</a> [JURIST report] to investigate abuses under Brazil's military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. Also in May a Guatemala judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/guatemala-judge-orders-second-genocide-trial-for-former-dictator.php">ordered a second trial</a> to prosecute former dictator Efrain Rios Montt for ordering a 1982 massacre which killed 201 people. In March Pillay claimed Guatemala is responsible for human rights abuses from that nation's <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/guatemala-must-still-seek-to-solve-human-rights-issues-un-rights-chief.php">failure to abide</a> [JURIST report] by the peace accord that ended the country's 36-year civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-144-Hollingsworth-v.-Perry-Cert-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will consider the validity of <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. Same-sex marriage was briefly legal in California following a state Supreme Court decision and then overturned with a constitutional amendment created by Proposition 8. Early in the proceedings, the state of California declined to defend the law, and the backers of Proposition 8, <a href = "http://protectmarriage.com/">ProtectMarriage.com</a> [advocacy website], successfully intervened. The court will consider whether Proposition 8 is constitutional under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> as well as if the Proposition 8 supporters had standing to intervene under <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [LII Cornell backgrounders].

<p>The court also granted <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket; <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/12-307-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], which examines the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href = "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. The case concerns <A href = "http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/windsor-v-united-states-thea-edie-doma">Edith Windsor</a> [ACLU backgrounder], a widow who had a legal same-sex marriage under Canadian and New York law but was denied spousal deduction for federal estate taxes when her wife died. The Supreme Court will consider the constitutionality of DOMA under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [LII Cornell backgrounder]. Prior to her challenge, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">announced</a> that it would no longer defend DOMA in courts, and in response, the US House of Representatives <A href = "/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">formed</a> [JURIST reports] the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) to defend the law. The court will also consider if BLAG had standing to intervene and if the DOJ's refusal to defend the law deprives the Supreme Court of jurisdiction. The <span class = "casename">Windsor</span> court held homosexuals to an intermediate scrutiny standard of review. The other petitions concerning same-sex marriage remain on hold.</p>

<p>The court granted three additional cases on Friday: <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-135.htm">Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter</a>, <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-416.htm">FTC v.

Judge Lucy Koh of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] has <a href="siliconvalley.com/apple-vs-samsung/ci_22142034/apple-award-samsung-patent-trial-could-shrink-judge">indicated</a> [<em>San Jose Mercury News</em> report] that she is considering setting aside the judgment of the jury and awarding Apple a smaller settlement amount calling arguments made by lawyers for Samsung "persuasive." Koh is also considering arguments from Apple's lawyers that Samsung should not be permitted to continue to sell devices the jury determined to be infringing on Apple patents. Koh has suggested she will have her ruling on the financial award given Apple as well as and injunctions on Samsung sales restrictions before the end of the year. An appeal by both parties is likely unless a settlement is brokered between the parties.

<p>The request by Koh is the most recent event in a protracted <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">patent litigation battle</a> [JURIST op-ed] with Samsung that spans over four continents. In October a judge for the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">issued a preliminary ruling</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung infringed four of Apple's patents relating to smartphone design and touchscreen technology. Also in October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. In the same month a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. Also in October, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/japan-reports-rejections-of-samsung-patent-infringement-claims-against-apple.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] patent infringement claims made by Samsung in Japan, overcoming Samsung's attempt to enjoin iPhone sales in the country. At the beginning of October, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its Galaxy Nexus product. Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ECHR claims that UAE security forces searched the home of Mohamed Salem al-Zumer and confiscated several electronics before arresting him and transferring him to an unknown location. The rights group condemned this arrest and the continued practice of arresting peaceful dissenters. In the statement, the ECHR detailed further restrictive practices:<blockquote>It has emerged that at least nine individuals have been banned from travelling and cannot leave the UAE. These names remained undisclosed due to fears of reprisals in light of the recently passed Cybercrimes Law, which criminalized Emiratis from passing information to both independent journalists and human rights organisations. Those banned from travelling are either relatives of detainees or known to be sympathetic of their plight. They have not been arrested, charged with a crime or given official reasons for the restrictions on their movement.</blockquote>The ECHR called upon the UAE to end its attacks on free speech.

<p>This is the most recent controversy involving human rights abuses in the UAE. In August a group of lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/imprisoned-lawyers-in-uae-go-on-hunger-strike.php">began a hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] to protest their illegal detentions. In July the UAE <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/uae-arrests-prominent-lawyer-in-ongoing-crackdown-on-islamist-dissidents.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] a prominent lawyer in a crackdown on Islamist dissidents. Amnesty International (AI) and Human Rights Watch in late April called on the UAE to <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/rights-groups-urge-uae-to-end-arrests-free-political-activists.php">stop the recent crackdown on political activists</a> [JURIST report] by ending arrests and releasing those already in custody, expressing concern that the UAE is threatening to revoke prisoners' citizenship as a way of punishing them for expressing public dissent, an action that the advocacy groups contend violates the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text]. AI has previously <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/uae-end-travesty-justice-five-convicted-over-insults-2011-11-27">called on the UAE government</a> [press release] to release such "prisoners of conscience" in compliance with international law.

Bandaranayake was <a href="http://www.colombopage.com/archive_12B/Dec08_1354979043CH.php">found guilty</a> [<em>Colombo Page</em> report] of three of the five charges against her. The first charge was related to a conflict of interest claim. The fourth charge dealt with claiming of assets for tax purposes. The fifth charge was a claim of bias in dealing with a case against her husband. The second and third charges were dismissed. After this guilty ruling, the committee is allowing a 10-day debate period in parliament to decide if these charges are enough to remove Bandaranayake from her chief justice position. Those in support of Bandaranayake maintain the charges against her are unfair while those in support of the hearings claim the allegations should be enough for impeachment. The debate period will begin when parliament reconvenes January 8.

<p>Earlier this month a group of judges got together to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/sri-lankan-judges-demand-impartial-inquiry-into-charges-against-chief-justice.php">call for impartiality</a> in the impeachment proceedings which <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/sri-lanka-lawyers-protest-impeachment-of-chief-justice.php">began</a> [JURIST reports] last month. The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war. In July the government of Sri Lanka said that it may take up to five years to prosecute people <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/sri-lanka-government-says-civil-war-crimes-may-take-five-years-to-prosecute.php">accused of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the civil war it fought with the separatist <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/liberation-tigers-tamil-eelam-aka-tamil-tigers-sri-lanka-separatists/p9242">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [CFR backgrounder]. Earlier in July Human Rights Watch urged Sri Lanka to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/hrw-urges-sri-lanka-to-end-journalist-harassment.php">stop arresting journalists who criticized the government</a> [JURIST report]. In November the Sri Lankan government was subjected to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Misick fled TCI following an inquiry into corruption on the small British territory which implicated him as having been engaged in widespread corruption and having stolen up to USD $180 million from TCI coffers. Misick was arrested in Rio de Janeiro where it is believed by Interpol investigators he had been living for over a year. British authorities are interested in having Misick extradited to TCI where he will be interrogated by the Special Investigation and Prosecution Team appointed by the British government to root out corruption on the islands.

Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC profile] on Sunday ended a controversial decree that had greatly expanded his presidential powers. Although the move was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/08/world/meast/egypt-protests/index.html">viewed as a concession</a> [CNN report] to protesters who had called for the end of the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-vastly-expands-powers-prompting-protests.php">decree</a> [JURIST report], Morsi refused to push the constitutional referendum on Egypt's <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2012.09.20_-_draft_constitution_-_english.pdf">draft constitution</a> [text, PDF] back from December 15, which the <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-high-court-suspends-all-work-in-face-of-heavy-protests.php">protesters had also wanted</a> [JURIST report]. Terminating the decree does not rescind any of the decisions Morsi made while the decree was in place, such as his approval of the draft constitution. Those decisions were not subject to judicial oversight and cannot be challenged in the court system. The announcement, given by a presidential adviser, followed a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/09/us-egypt-politics-idUSBRE8B30GP20121209">presidential "national dialogue" meeting</a> [Reuters report] that was boycotted by the president's opponents. Egyptian authorities claim six people have died as a result of the protests, and the Muslim Brotherhood has said the clashes have claimed the lives of eight members.

<p>Egypt's <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] last year has generated many political clashes, particularly regarding the draft constitution. Last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-turmoil-in-egypt.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] at the rising death toll during the ongoing political chaos. Pillay complained that Egypt's draft constitution passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators and that it omitted references to international human rights treaties that Egypt had ratified. Also last week Egypt's Supreme Judicial Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-top-judges-to-oversee-constitutional-referendum.php">agreed to oversee the national referendum</a> [JURIST report] on the country's new constitution and planned to delegate  about 10,000 judges to monitor the referendum. In late November Egyptian courts <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-courts-suspend-work-to-protest-presidential-decree.php">suspended work</a> [JURIST report] to protest Morsi's decree because it had removed judicial review of his actions. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch<a> [advocacy website] urged Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-urged-to-amend-draft-constitution-comply-with-international-treaties-hrw.php">amend its proposed constitution</a> [JURIST report] to comply with international treaties. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in</a> as president, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolving parliament after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally. The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-high-court-suspends-presidential-decree-to-reconvene-parliament.php">suspended</a> Morsi's decree two days later, after which Morsi vowed that he would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-says-he-will-respect-court-ruling-on-parliament.php">respect the ruling</a> [JURIST reports]. Days before its dissolution, the Egyptian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-court-to-rule-on-constitutionality-of-political-isolation-law.php">elected</a> a new constitutional council after lawmakers finally reached an <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-reaches-agreement-on-constitutional-panel.php">agreement</a> [JURIST reports] on the political composition of the council.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN expert, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Defenders/MARGARETSEKAGGYA_CV.pdf">Margaret Sekaggya</a> [official profile, PDF], strongly condemned Chen Kegui's treatment and demanded that the Chinese government work to ensure that the fundamental human rights of activists and their families are not violated as a result of their peaceful activities. In particular, Sekaggya stressed her discontent with Chen Kegui's lack of legal representation at his trial on November 30 and noted that the legal proceeding in no way appeared equal between the prosecution and defense. The Special Rapporteur ended her plea by calling on China to promptly investigate all acts perpetrated against human rights defenders and their families, and to prosecute those responsible. 

<p>Chen Guangcheng, an outspoken activist known as China's "barefoot lawyer," was originally wanted in his rural town for exposing forced abortions and other human rights abuses. In May he urged the US <a href="http://www.cfr.org/">Council on Foreign Relations</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/china-activist-urges-us-to-push-for-rule-of-law-in-china.php">"try harder" to promote the rule of law</a> [JURIST report] in China. Chen <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/china-activist-arrives-in-new-york-thanks-us-for-aid.php">arrived</a> in New York only a week earlier after he <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/china-activist-leaves-us-embassy-after-escaping-house-arrest.php">left the US embassy</a> [JURIST reports] earlier in the month. His arrival resolved a US-China struggle that began when he <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/china-activist-escapes-house-arrest-to-us-protection.php">escaped</a> [JURIST report] from his house arrest and sought refuge at the US embassy in Beijing in April. The house arrest began after Chen had already <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-rights-activist-after-serving-4-year-sentence.php">served</a> four years <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/china-jails-activist-on-property.php">in prison</a> [JURIST reports] for damaging property and "organizing a mob to disturb traffic."</p>]]></content:encoded>

This order, which leads up to the already controversial referendum on Egypt's constitution, gives the military the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20661758">power to arrest civilians</a> [BBC report] and transfer them into detention for prosecution. When considered with the other powers given to the military and <a href="http://action.amnesty.org.uk/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=1194&ea.campaign.id=12787">restrictions on expression</a> [AI report], this will allow the military to arrest individuals for media offenses and "thuggery" and then transfer them to the prosecutor where they <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/10/egypt-morsi-move-fails-to-pacify-opposition-live#block-50c5e58595cbcfe457e3db68">may be detained</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] for up to six months. This leads to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/egyptian-military-urged-halt-torture-detainees-2011-02-17">further concern</a> [AI report] over the military's treatment of detainees. Morsi supporters claim this order was needed to preserve the peace amid minority opposition, a role the military regularly played under <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive], but they do <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/10/egypt-politics-army-idUSL5E8NA90J20121210">not have that express power</a> [Reuters report] under the new government.

<p>Egypt's <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] last year has generated many political clashes, particularly regarding the draft constitution. This new decree comes only one day after Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-ends-decree-expanding-presidential-powers.php">revoked</a> the expanded powers he <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-president-vastly-expands-powers-prompting-protests.php">gave himself</a> [JURIST reports] late last month. Last week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-turmoil-in-egypt.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] at the rising death toll during the ongoing political chaos. Pillay complained that Egypt's draft constitution passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators and that it omitted references to international human rights treaties that Egypt had ratified. Also last week, Egypt's Supreme Judicial Council agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-top-judges-to-oversee-constitutional-referendum.php">oversee the national referendum</a> [JURIST report] on the country's new constitution and planned to delegate about 10,000 judges to monitor the referendum. In late November Egyptian courts <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/egypt-courts-suspend-work-to-protest-presidential-decree.php">suspended work</a> [JURIST report] to protest Morsi's decree because it had removed judicial review of his actions. In October, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] urged Egypt to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/egypt-urged-to-amend-draft-constitution-comply-with-international-treaties-hrw.php">amend its proposed constitution</a> [JURIST report] to comply with international treaties. In July, a few days after he was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/egypt-swears-in-first-democratically-elected-president.php">sworn in</a> as president, Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/egypt-president-calls-to-reconvene-parliament-despite-high-court-ruling.php">issued a decree</a> [JURIST reports] calling the Egyptian parliament back into session, despite a previous ruling by the Supreme Constitutional Court dissolving parliament after finding that one-third of its members were elected illegally.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report was released in response to several inquiries regarding US compliance with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text]. In response to an inquiry regarding detention of juveniles, the US claimed that holding the juveniles was not to punish them, but to prevent them from returning to fight. The report cited to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-6696.ZS.html">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</a> [text] in justifying this decision. The US also emphasized that it is treating the juvenile detainees in a way that is consistent with the convention. This includes specialized medical attention, potential familial cohabitation and individualized educational, recreational and social activities. 

<p>The international community has been monitoring the rights of the child since to convention entered into force in 1990. In July a UN committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-condemns-israel-treatment-of-child-detainees.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Israel's treatment of child detainees. Last November the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-panel-asks-syria-for-report-on-child-torture-allegations.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] Syria to respond to inquiries regarding a report dealing with child torture. In November 2008, the US <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-admits-more-juveniles-held-at.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] to the committee that it was detaining 12 juveniles in Guantanamo. This realization came only months after the committee <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-military-tribunals-wrong-venue-for.php">asserted</a> [JURIST report] that military tribunals were not the proper venue for juvenile detainees. In May of that year the Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/dod-to-verify-number-of-juvenile-enemy.php">confirmed</a> a previous <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-detained-over-2000-minors.php">report</a> [JURIST reports] that the US was detaining 2,500 juveniles in Afghanistan. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, Judge Ricardo Martinez found that <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=6251&year=2012">Senate Bill 6251</a> [materials], which required Washington Internet websites to document that advertised escorts were at least 18 years of age, violates several provisions of both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html#amdt14a_hd1">Fourteenth</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] Amendments to the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">US Constitution</a> [text]. Since then, the state has seemingly accepted that the bill's language <a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/2012/12/washingtons-online-sex-trafficking-law-struck-down-in-federal-court/">went too far</a> [AP report] in criminalizing the dissemination of advertisements with "an explicit or implicit offer for a commercial sex act to occur in Washington." In addition to violating free speech, being unconstitutionally vague, being overly broad, and violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], Martinez also found that the law violates and is preempted by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act </a> [text], which declares that Internet service operators are not to be construed as publishers, and are thus not legally liable for third-party speech used via their services. The state was consequently ordered to pay $200,000 in attorney's fees to plaintiffs Backpage.com, LLC and <a href="http://archive.org/index.php">The Internet Archive</a> [official website], a non-profit digital library.

<p>Senate Bill 6151's intention was to prohibit anyone from "advertising [the] commercial sexual abuse of a minor if he or she knowingly publishes, disseminates, or displays, or causes directly or indirectly, to be published, disseminated, or displayed, any advertisement for a commercial sex act." Though the goal is commendable, its language has been received with skepticism by the courts. In July Martinez <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/W.D.Wash_._2-12-cv-00954_69.pdf">granted a preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF] for the plaintiffs in an opinion that foreshadowed the law's ultimate invalidation. Backpage.com initially <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/backpagecomplaint-filed.pdf">filed the lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, "Freedom of Thought 2012: A Global Report on Discrimination Against Humanists, Atheists, and the Non-Religious," was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/10/us-religion-atheists-idUSBRE8B900520121210">released on Monday</a> [Reuters report] to recognize <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/humanrightsday/">Human Rights Day</a> [UN backgrounder], and discusses laws and cases in 60 countries where atheists have been prosecuted for their beliefs. It also reports that the laws are used to curb the rights of the non-religious. Specifically, certain decrees are used to suppress expression, restrict the right to marry, obstruct access to public education, criminalize blasphemy, and even execute those who choose to stop practicing the religion of their parents. Additionally, the report notes a drastic increase in blasphemy cases in 2012, as more than a dozen people in 10 counties have been prosecuted for their posts on Facebook and Twitter, as compared to the three cases prosecuted over the last three years. The report was welcomed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/FreedomReligionIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief</a> [official website], Heiner Bielefeldt, who hopes that the international community will reflect on the IHEU's findings.

<p>In October, Bielefeldt <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-expert-urges-promotion-of-freedom-of-religious-conversion.php">presented his own report</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] that urged all member states to protect freedom of belief as it applies to religious conversion.

In a challenge brought by the <a href="http://acluofnc.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina Legal Foundation</a> (ACLU-NCLF) [advocacy website], Judge James Fox found that the "Choose Life" license plates were an expression of private speech rather than government speech which would have allowed the North Carolina General Assembly to regulate the message:<blockquote>The court concludes ... that sufficient private speech interests are implicated by the specialty license plates to preclude a finding of purely government speech. The court finds that this conclusion is in keeping with the common-sense notion that the North Carolina specialty license plate program as a whole, and the Choose Life plates in particular, are, at bottom, a government-sponsored avenue to encourage private speech. The court also concludes &#8230; that the State's offering of a Choose Life license plate in the absence of a pro-choice plate constitutes viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment.</blockquote>Fox had previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-north-carolina-choose-life-license-plates.php">issued an injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the specialty plates. JURIST Guest Columnist Scott Gaylord argued that Fox <a href="/forum/2011/12/scott-gaylord-government-speech.php">applied an outdated government speech test</a> [JURIST op-ed] when he issued the injunction, claiming the proper test should ask if government controls the speech, not if a third party can tell that the government is speaking.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain a controversial issue in North Carolina and across the country. Last year a federal judge issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report]], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. The judge <a href="http://www.acluofnc.org/files/Ultrasound%20Opinion%20102511.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] challenge to certain provisions of the <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&amp;BillID=hb854">"Woman's Right to Know Act"</a> [HB 854 materials]. Opponents of the law have called it "draconian" and have stated that women seeking abortions will face dramatic changes once the law takes effect, while supporters contend that the new law will give women the opportunity to "know all the facts" about abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Solis</a> [JURIST report] that a federal employee appealing a "mixed case" from the <A href = "http://www.mspb.gov/">Merit Systems Protection Board</a> (MSPB) [official website] should appeal by suing in the appropriate district court, not appealing the decision to the Federal Circuit. The "mixed case" in this situation involved a wrongful termination claim that was to be decided with a discrimination claim. The former typically is appealed to the Federal Circuit after the MSPB decision, while the latter can be taken directly to district court if so desired. Carolyn Kloeckner, through a series of various agency decisions due to the unusual nature of her mixed case, was denied review in district court because the MSPB had decided her matter on procedural grounds, not the merits, and thus the district court and the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit believed the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction. Justice Elena Kagan explained that this was not the case, pointing to sections <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7703">7703</a> and <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/7702">7702</a> [texts] of the <a href = "http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/complcsra.htm">Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</a> [materials].<blockquote>As the above account reveals, the intersection of federal civil rights statutes and civil service law has produced a complicated, at times confusing, process for resolving claims of discrimination in the federal workplace. But even within the most intricate and complex systems, some things are plain. So it is in this case, where two sections of the CSRA, read naturally, direct employees like Kloeckner to district court. [...] Now just put &#167;7703 and &#167;7702 together-say, in the form of a syllogism, to make the point obvious. Under &#167;7703(b)(2), "cases of discrimination subject to [ &#167;7702]" shall be filed in district court. Under &#167;7702(a)(1), the "cases of discrimination subject to [&#167;7702]" are mixed cases-those appealable to the MSPB and alleging discrimination. Ergo, mixed cases shall be filed in district court. 

<p>And so that is where Kloeckner's case should have been filed (as indeed it was).</blockquote>The Supreme Court reversed the <A href = "http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Kloeckner_v_Solis_639_F3d_834_112_FEP_Cases_426_8th_Cir_2011_Cour">decision</a> [opinion] of the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</p>

<p>The case arose when Carolyn Kloeckner filed an anti-discrimination claim against the Department of Labor (DOL), where she worked, with the <a href = "http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website]. She claimed that she was being discriminated based on age and gender. This type of claim would not be appealable to the MSPB because no personnel action had been taken against. However, while she was waiting for the EEOC to rule on her claim, she was fired, and thus had a second claim for unlawful termination. Due to a series of procedural mishaps, Kloeckner had concurrent claims in both the EEOC and MSPB. She amended the former and had the latter dismissed without prejudice, but later, when the EEOC finally ruled, they returned the case to the DOL as a sanction for Kloeckner not following proper discovery procedure. The DOL ruled against Kloeckner, and when she attempted to appeal, her case was dismissed due to the belief she was appealing her original case with the MSPB. She then filed in district court, which ruled against her for lack of jurisdiction. This far, her case has never been adjudged on the merits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The petition was filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and the Yale Law School <a href="http://www.law.yale.edu/intellectuallife/lowensteinclinic.htm">Lowenstein International Human Rights Law Clinic</a> [academic website] on behalf of Padilla and his mother, Estella Lebron. Lebron and Padilla have filed federal lawsuits in US courts, but those claims have been dismissed. According to the complaint:<blockquote>In sum, no U.S. court has ever heard the merits of Mr. Padilla's claims that he was tortured. A court has never determined the "truth or error" or his allegations, much less provided him with a remedy. All three of the elements required by the Commission to satisfy an Article XVIII right to a remedy have been denied to Mr. Padilla: 1) he was denied access to a court or tribunal for years, 2) no court or tribunal has heard his case on the merits, and 3) no adequate remedy has been given. In sum, though Mr. Padilla had the right to file a civil suit in the United States, his right to a remedy proved to be "illusory" because, like other claimants before him, his cases were erroneously dismissed on national security grounds.</blockquote>The petition requests that the IACHR conduct a full investigation into the alleged human rights violations, to find that Padilla's treatment violated the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/Basicos/English/Basic2.american%20Declaration.htm">American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man</a> [text], and to recommend that the US publicly acknowledge the violations and apologize for its conduct.

<p>In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-guantanamo-prisoner-cases.php">declined</a> to accept Padilla's <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/padilla-appeals-dismissal-of-unlawful-detention-suit-to-supreme-court.php">appeal</a> challenging the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/fourth-circuit-.php">dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of his lawsuit against US officials for allegedly illegally detaining him at a military jail in South Carolina. Padilla was arrested in 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and thereafter detained as an enemy combatant. He was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/padilla-convicted-in-federal-terror.php">convicted</a> on terrorism charges in 2007 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-gets-17-year-prison-sentence-on.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to 17 years in prison. In September 2011 the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that Padilla's sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-rules-17-year-sentence-for-padilla-too-lenient.php">too lenient and ordered a new sentencing hearing</a> [JURIST report]. The court noted Padilla's 17 prior arrests and objected to a reduction of his sentence for the three-and-a-half years he was detained as an "enemy combatant" on a base in South Carolina before charges were brought against him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rajab, founder of the <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en">Bahrain Center for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website], was originally sentenced to <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en/node/5387">three years imprisonment</a> [BCHR materials] for leading unlicensed protests against the powerful Sunni Muslim al-Khalifa dynasty. The judge ruled on three cases against Rajab, each related to peaceful protesting. In one case, the judge upheld the original one-year sentence. The sentences for the other two cases were reduced to six months each. Just last week, several US Congressmen <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/BahrainLetter81012.pdf">wrote</a> [text, PDF] to Bahraini King Hamad al-Khalifa to "express [their] concern regarding Nabeel Rajab and other Bahrainis who have been prosecuted for crimes related to freedom of expression." It is uncertain whether Rajab will try to appeal further from the decision made on Tuesday. 

<p>Bahrain has faced international criticism for its crackdown against dissidents since anti-government protests began last year. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Bahrain's court of appeals to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/bahrain-center-for-human-rights-urges-king-to-release-their-leader.php">overturn the conviction of Rajab</a> [JURIST report]. Also in October, the Bahrain Court of Cassation <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-court-of-cassation.php">upheld jail sentences</a> [JURIST report] for nine medics convicted for their involvement in Bahrain's pro-democracy uprising. According to <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en">Bahrain News Agency</a> [official website], the medics were working at <a href="http://www.moh.gov.bh/en/HealthEstablishment/SMC.aspx">Salmaniya Medical Complex</a> [official website], and, during the time of the uprising, "took over the complex, detained and imprisoned kidnapped persons, and transformed the hospital to a place of illegal gathering and strikes, in violation of laws." According to <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> [official website], at least 95 health workers were arrested in Bahrain only after some medics treated those hurt by security forces and spoke out against the crackdown against protesters, which included firing upon ambulances. Last month government officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/bahrain-pledges-to-follow-un-plan-to-improve-human-rights-conditions.php">pledged to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] the 158 recommendations included in the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/BHSession13.aspx">Universal Periodic Review </a>[materials] regarding human rights abuses against political opposition.

The report, titled "Still a Long Way to Go," details the implementation of the <a href="http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/EVAW%20law%20-%202009.pdf">Law of Elimination of Violence against Women</a> (EVAW law) [text, PDF] enacted in August 2009. The UNAMA looked at reported cases of violence against women at different stages of the judicial process from October 2010 to September 2012 and gathered information from prosecutors, judges and police officers from 22 provinces, as well as conducted more than 200 interviews with women victims, doctors, legal representatives, UN agencies and more. Obtaining accurate and reliable information was challenging, but the report stated violence against women is still widespread in Afghanistan. Of those reported, battery and laceration crimes were the most prevalent, followed by sexual violence and harmful practices such as early and forced marriages. <blockquote>Many women victims of violence do not report their situation to law enforcement and judicial institutions due to cultural restraints, social norms and taboos, customary and religious beliefs relegating women to subordinate position, fear of social stigma, exclusion and, at times, even threat to life. As a result, many incidents of violence against women were not reported to formal law enforcement and justice institutions. For example, according to estimations of the AIHRC [Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission] office in Paktya, almost 80 per cent of relevant cases were not reported to the ANP [Afghan National Police] or the judiciary.</blockquote>The report concludes that serious concerns remain in laws, policies and practice, and the government should commit to eliminating violence against women and improving implementation of the EVAW law. 

<p>Violence against women has been a long-standing issue in Afghanistan and around the world. Last month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-urges-international-effort-to-end-violence-against-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] countries to implement policies that will end violence against women. Also in November the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-panel-urges-countries-to-ban-female-genital-mutilation.php">approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] calling for a global ban on female genital mutilation. At the same time, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website]<a href="/paperchase/2012/11/hrw-colombia-women-facing-obstacles-to-health-care-legal-remedies.php"> released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing violence and obstacles women are facing in Colombia, where the legal framework is often not properly applied despite the government's progress in enacting legislation to protect violence against women. </p>]]></content:encoded>

As part of the DOJ's deal, HSBC has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g8pWBWM-__xZiKLNJdCo-evrvm4w?docId=f4c9570869cd48a5b034b457c9f12708">agreed to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement</a> [AP report] for its violation of various federal laws. In particular, HSBC Bank USA violated the <a href="http://www.occ.gov/topics/compliance-bsa/bsa/index-bsa.html">Bank Secrecy Act</a> [materials] when it failed to maintain "an effective anti-money laundering program and to conduct appropriate due diligence on its foreign correspondent account holders." Additionally, according to the DOJ, HSBC also violated the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ieepa.pdf">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/twea.pdf">Trading with the Enemy Act</a> [texts, PDFs] by "illegally conducting transactions on behalf of customers in Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan, and Burma, all countries that were subject to sanctions by the <a href="www.treasury.gov/ofac">Office of Foreign Assets Control </a> [official website] at the time of the transactions." Aside from criminal penalties, HSBC has also agreed to pay $500 million to the <a href="www.occ.gov/">Office of the Comptroller of Currency</a> and $165 million to the <a href="www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve</a> [official websites] for a total of about $1.92 billion, which is the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-hsbc-fine-20121211,0,2695064.story">largest fine ever imposed on a bank</a> [Reuters report]. Although the agreement settles HSBC's case in the US, which was filed in the <a href="https://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a>, the UK's <a href="www.fsa.gov.uk/">Financial Services Authority</a> [official websites] has chosen to pursue a separate legal action.

<p>Tuesday's announcement was the latest development in the DOJ's recent string of fraudulent practice prosecutions. Last month the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/moneygram-international-reaches-settlement-for-fraud.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.moneygram.com/MGICorp/index.htm">MoneyGram International, Inc.</a> [corporate website] entered into a similar deferred prosecution agreement for criminally aiding and abetting wire fraud and failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. A week prior, <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">Wells Fargo</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/wells-fargo-challenges-lawsuit-by-us-government.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit filed by the US government to recover money from defective mortgages was barred by a previous settlement. In September, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/court-approves-settlement-in-e-book-conspiracy-suit.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a settlement agreement between the DOJ and certain e-book publishers in a price-fixing suit. In July, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/federal-court-grants-emergency-order-freezing-trader-assets-in-sec-case.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an emergency order freezing the assets of foreign brokers accused of insider trading. Also in July, the DOJ and pharmaceutical giant <a href="http://www.gsk.com/">GlaxoSmithKline</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/glaxosmithkline-settles-health-care-fraud-case-for-3-billion.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a $3 billion settlement in a series of criminal and civil healthcare fraud cases against the drug company.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Diarra's ouster has been seen as a show of force by a military that staged a coup in March and continues to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-mali-primeminister-idUSBRE8BA03V20121211">exert its influence and power</a> [Reuters report] throughout Mali. Following his arrest, the now ex-prime minister was taken to a meeting with former coup leader Captain Amadou Sanogo, where he was accused of urging citizens to disrupt talks on the current political crisis and failing to liberate the nation's north, much of which has been seized by ethnic Tuareg rebels and al Qaeda-linked Islamist fighters. Both groups have been the subject of international attention, particularly for <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/10/us-mali-crisis-un-idUSBRE8991OI20121010">exacerbating the humanitarian crisis</a> [Reuters report] by targeting civilians and <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-mali-islamists-abusing-human-rights.php">abusing human rights</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The crisis in Mali has drawn a great deal of international scorn and scrutiny. In September <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/islamic-groups-abuse-population-employ-child-soldiers-in-northern-mali.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that three armed Islamist groups in northern Mali are abusing the local population and recruiting child soldiers. Earlier that month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-chief-condemns-mali-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations in Mali and called for international action to address the problems. Pillay noted that two militant Islamic groups are recruiting child soldiers, committing cruel punishments, violating basic human rights, committing sexual violence against women, and executing individuals. In August, officials from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] were in Mali <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-investigating-allegations-of-war-crimes-in-mali.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] whether the same two Islamic groups had committed war crimes in Mali.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Minister <a href = "http://www.culture.gov.uk/about_us/our_ministers/9316.aspx">Maria Miller</a> [official profile] made the statement in the <a href = "http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/">House of Commons</a> [official website], <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/dec/11/gay-marriage-commons-statement-live">detailing</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the government's plan as well as the research that went into the decision. Same-sex couples will be granted full access to civil marriage rights and permitted access to any marriage ceremonies available. However, if a religious organization has "opted out" of same-sex marriage, an individual minister in that sect would be unable to defy the group by marrying a couple. The Church of England will not be required to conduct or endorse same-sex marriages. Miller also suggested that the Church of England can advise the government if it changes its position on same-sex marriage.<blockquote>Marriage is one of the most important institutions we have in this country. It binds us together, brings long-term commitment and stability, and makes society stronger. Our proposals mean that marriage would be available to everyone. I feel strongly that, if a couple wish to show their love and commitment to each other, the State should not stand in their way. These changes will strengthen marriage in our society and ensure that it remains a modern and vibrant tradition. And we are also building a fairer society for all.</blockquote>A representative for the <a href = "http://www.labour.org.uk/">Labour</a> [party website] party, the shadow minister of Equalities, supported the proposal and urged Miller to back it forcefully. The UK currently offers civil partnerships to same-sex couples, which will be eligible to be converted into marriages. The bill is expected to be presented in January. Miller suggested that 60 percent of Conservative members of parliament currently back the proposal.

<p>The Conservative party's decision was made in response to a government <a href = "http://homeoffice.gov.uk/equalities/lgbt/equal-marriage/">consultation</a> [materials] on the issue. Although the government found 53 percent of citizens who responded in favor of same-sex marriage, it received petitions with over 500,000 signatures opposed to legalizing civil marriage. In response to the government's announcement, a bishop for the Church of England released a <a href = "http://www.churchofengland.org/media-centre/news/2012/12/bishop-of-leicester-responds-to-government-consultation-on-equal-marriage.aspx">statement</a> [text]: "Marriage is not the property of the Government nor is it the property of the Church; and while the forms and legalities around marriage have evolved over time, as the noble lady minister has pointed out, one fundamental feature has remained the same throughout: that marriage is a union of one man and one woman, a social institution that pre-dates both Church and State and has been the glue that has bound countless successive societies together."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Relying on the US <a href="www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [opinion, PDF], Judge Richard Posner opined that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/second_amendment">Second Amendment</a> [text] "confers a right to bear arms for self-defense, which is as important outside the home as inside," and that Illinois failed to provide the court with "more than merely a rational basis for believing that its uniquely sweeping ban is justified by an increase in public safety." Posner also relied on the absence of such a law in all 49 other states, reasoning that, if the Illinois ban were "demonstrably superior," one may "expect at least one or two other states to have emulated it." While the ruling is considered a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hYj3DUXdkpkBoAxGlkTql0BmASBA?docId=71bd66d548554ae293b930e464ed09d6">major victory for gun rights advocates</a> [AP report], the Seventh Circuit did stay its ruling. Specifically, the court will allow 180 days for "the Illinois legislature to craft a new gun law that will impose reasonable limitations, consistent with the public safety and the Second Amendment ... on the carrying of guns in public."

<p>Illinois lawmakers, particularly those in Chicago, have struggled to limit firearm possession and advance <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gun+control">gun control</a> [JURIST news archive] initiatives in the city without violating the Constitution. In June the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-strikes-down-part-of-chicago-gun-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of the <a href="http://www.isp.state.il.us/docs/ordinances/chicago.pdf">Chicago Firearms Ordinance</a> [text, PDF] that prevents firearm purchase by individuals who have "been convicted by a court in any jurisdiction of ... unlawful use of a weapon that is a firearm" because such a standard is unconstitutionally vague. The Ordinance was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/chicago-approves-new-handgun-regulations.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Chicago City Council in July 2010, and imposes strict regulations on firearm possession. In particular, residents who possess firearms are required to keep them inside their homes, and are not permitted to take their guns into the yard, garage or porch of the home. The legislation was enacted four days after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">ruled in McDonald v. Chicago</a> [JURIST report] that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is applicable to the states as well as the federal government. The decision effectively struck down Chicago's former handgun ban, as it prohibited citizens from keeping handguns in their homes under any circumstances. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The order, made public Wednesday, effectively blocks the public's access to accused <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] conspirators' testimony regarding the alleged use of "enhanced interrogation techniques," imprisonment and torture methods by the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website]. The decision upholds the continued use of a delayed audio feed of the proceedings, which allows an intelligence officer to censor any reference to "classified" material as it arises during testimony. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], backed by a host of prominent media organizations, <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/aclu-seeks-access-to-911-trial-testimony.php">filed a motion</a> [JURIST report] in May and argued in October that this practice <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/gitmo_public_access_transcript_oct_16_0.pdf">violates the First Amendment</a> [transcripts 1 &#38; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/gitmo_public_access_transcript_oct_17_0.pdf">2</a>, PDF] and that the public has a constitutional right to access information about the operation of the government. According to the ACLU, Army Col. James Pohl's decision <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/judge-rules-censorship-torture-testimony-guantanamo-military-commission">does not adequately address clear First Amendment issues</a> [press release], and the organization is assessing its options. The prosecution is seeking the death penalty for all five accused 9/11 conspirators.

<p>In April Pohl <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/chief-guantanamo-judge-sets-trial-date-for-911-accused.php">assigned himself</a> [JURIST report] to preside over the tribunals of the five alleged plotters of the 9/11 terror attacks, scheduling a hearing for May 5. Earlier in April the Department of Defense (DOD) <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/dod-refers-charges-against-911-suspects-to-military-commission.php">referred charges</a> [JURIST report] to Pohl against the five accused 9/11 plotters. The DOD announced last year that it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/military-prosecutors-bring-charges-against-911-suspects.php">sworn charges against the five men</a> [JURIST report]. In April 2011 US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four others would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried by a military commission</a> [JURIST report] after the Obama administration abandoned attempts to have the 9/11 suspects tried in civilian courts. Holder had wanted the accused be tried before a federal civilian court but referred the cases to the DOD after Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">imposed a series of restrictions</a> [JURIST reports] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Thomas Thrash's order is in line with an August ruling by the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] that provision of the law, but it remains to be seen how police will <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/enforcement-of-georgias-immigration-law-will-vary/nTTKb/">enforce the provision</a> [AJC report]. The Eleventh Circuit also struck down a portion of Georgia's immigration law known as Section 7, which makes it a crime for anyone to harbor an undocumented immigrant or help an undocumented immigrant remain in the US. A full legal challenge to the constitutionality of the law could take several years.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration law</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has became a hot button issue over the past few years as many states have passed laws giving state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. Last month the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-appeals-court-denies-alabama-request-to-reconsider-immigration-ruling.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] Alabama's request to reconsider its ruling partially striking down that state's immigration law. Earlier in November a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/index.asp">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-upholds-motorist-provision-of-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] part of South Carolina's controversial <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/20.htm">immigration law</a> [SB 20 materials] that permits law enforcement officials to detain motorists on the side of the road for a "reasonable amount of time" while the officer checks the driver's immigration status. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in September denied a request for a new injunction against a controversial provision of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">immigration law</a> [SB 1070, PDF] which requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of persons they stop or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the US illegally. In August the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on two anti-illegal immigrant laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation was quickly <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder/0,4668,7-277-57577_57657-291256--,00.html">signed into law</a> [press release] by Michigan <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/snyder">Governor Rick Synder</a> [official website]. The bills address employees in both the <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(nmnl2p45ngbfwkin1hcfxa55))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectname=2011-HB-4003">public</a> [HB 4003 materials] and <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(nmnl2p45ngbfwkin1hcfxa55))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectname=2011-SB-0116">private</a> [SB 0116 materials] sectors. Pro-labor activists gathered at the State Capitol to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-usa-unions-michigan-idUSBRE8B91AJ20121211">protest</a> [Reuters report] the legislation. In his statement, Synder said, "Workers deserve the right to decide for themselves whether union membership benefits them."  He also noted that this legislation does not effect workplace health and safety regulations. With this legislation, Michigan has become to the twenty-fourth right to work state.

<p>Attempts to limit collective bargaining rights and the influence of labor unions have been confronted with heavy opposition. In September the Michigan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/michigan-supreme-court-orders-union-measure-on-ballot.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a union-backed measure to amend the state constitution to include a right to labor unionization and collective bargaining to appear on the November ballot. The measure <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2012/general/by_state/statewide/MI.html?SITE=MIDTFELN&SECTION=POLITICS">was defeated 57-43 percent</a> [AP report]. Wisconsin faced a challenge against its legislation which limited the collective bargaining rights of public employee unions. In March a judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federaljudge-strikes-down-parts-of-wisconsin-collective-bargaining-law.php">ruled unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] certain provisions of the state's <a href="http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/jr1_sb11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [text, PDF]  reasoning that unions which supported <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/Home">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] during his election were apparently given preferential treatment. Last November Ohio voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-voters-reject-collective-bargaining-law-in-statewide-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bill which would have impacted Ohio's 400,000 public workers by limiting their ability to strike and collectively bargain for health insurance and pensions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Though <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gHnosJcnf9iKQhKfVVHJMYFFZ7iQ?docId=f1646992efe84f51bde90fa083a28344">Mahama was declared the winner</a> [AP report] of Ghana's December 7 election with  50.7 percent of the valid vote, opposition leaders declared that they have "serious reservations about the validity of what the Chairman of the Electoral Commission has done in declaring results that ... do not reflect the mandate of the required majority of the Ghanaian electorate." Since then, NPP leadership has submitted a two-fold <a href="http://www.thenewpatrioticparty.org/index.php/press/110-press/our-press/394-re-request-for-an-audit-of-verification-machines-and-recount-of-the-presidential-ballot">request</a> [text] to the Returning Office of the President Elections. First, NPP has asked for an audit of the verification machines "to establish that it tallies with Constituency Collated signed results," and second, it has asked for an order to re-collate "the presidential ballot at the constituency level to help establish the credibility and accuracy" of the December 7 election. NPP's presidential candidate, <a href="http://akufoaddo2012.com/">Nana Akufo-Addo</a> [campaign website], finished second in the election with 47.74 percent of the electoral vote and has encouraged all NPP members and his supporters to remain calm.

<p>Though Ghana's president elections were held last Friday, Mahama was not declared the winner until Sunday. The delays have been attributed to "technical glitches" with the country's new voting machines, and the problems forced many polling places to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20631933">extend voting</a> [BBC report]. Despite the issues, voter turnout was particularly high, with roughly 80 percent of 14 million registered voters casting ballots. This is the second presidential defeat for Akufo-Addo, who <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/indepth/ghana2008.shtml">lost to Mahama in 2008</a> [BBC backgrounder] by less than 1 percent of the electorate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The panel of judges ruled that the law is an unconstitutional <a href="http://www.lagazzettadelmezzogiorno.it/notizia.php?IDNotizia=576594&IDCategoria=2694">violation of fundamental rights regarding health</a> [ANSA report] and the freedom of research. The case was originally brought by a couple who wished to donate leftover embryos to science after the couple finished a series of legal fertility treatments. Italy <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/28/us-italy-embryo-idUSBRE8AR17Z20121128">has defended its ban</a> [Reuters report] on embryonic screening by claiming that it wishes to avoid risks of eugenic abuses and the potential for future "designer babies." The largely Catholic nation has some of the strictest artificial procreation laws in Europe. The case will next move up to be considered by the Italian <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/default.do">Constitutional Court</a> [official website].

<p>Law 40 has been controversial due to its ban on in vitro fertilization, a type of fertility treatment for couples who have had difficulty conceiving children or wish to avoid passing genetic traits on to their children. In November the <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/italy-appeals-europe-rights-court-decision-on-embryonic-screening-ban.php">Italian government appealed a ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], which <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/104299342/Affaire-Costa-Et-Pavan-c-Itali#fullscreen">struck down</a> [judgment, in French] parts of Law 40 in August. In that case, a couple already having one child with cystic fibrosis brought suit after seeking an embryo screening as a precautionary method for future children. The ECHR ruling that denying the couple access to such a screening violates Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention on Human Rights</a> for failing to recognize the right to privacy and family life. The ECHR ordered the Italian government to pay the couple &#8364;17,500 (USD $21,900) in damages and court fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Though the court's judgment was limited to the Cologne region, the ruling sparked outrage in religious communities, and doctors refused to carry out the procedure because of the potential for legal action. The new law allows parents to have their sons <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germany-approves-law-to-protect-male-circumcision-after-court-ruling-branded-practice-harmful/2012/12/12/f71a37f0-4470-11e2-8c8f-fbebf7ccab4e_story.html">circumcised by a trained practitioner</a> [WP report], or by a doctor after the child passes six months of age.

Lebanese German citizen Khaled el-Masri was arrested and mistreated for 23 days of interrogation in a hotel in the Macedonian capital Skopje, then transferred to CIA agents who took him to a secret detention facility in Afghanistan where he was held for four months. After a hearing in May, the ECHR Grand Chamber of 17 judges unanimously held that el-Masri had established beyond a reasonable doubt that Macedonia was responsible for several violations of various provisions of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Basic+Texts/The+Convention+and+additional+protocols/The+European+Convention+on+Human+Rights/">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [materials], including the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3, the right to liberty and security under Article 5 and others. The ECHR ordered the government of Macedonia to pay el-Masri &#8364;60,000 in damages. El-Masri has been involved in several violent incidents in Germany in the last few years, receiving a suspended sentence for arson in 2007 and a two-year prison sentence for assaulting a town mayor in 2010, for which he is still serving time. 

<p>Although the el-Masri case focused on Macedonia, the issue of CIA extraordinary rendition has been a sensitive one across Europe. In September the Italian <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/italy-high-court-upholds-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents-in-rendition-case.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 23 former CIA officers for the 2003 kidnapping and rendition of Egyptian terror suspect Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. In April UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/BenEmmerson.aspx">Ben Emmerson</a> [official profile] expressed regret over a US court decision denying <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/foia.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [National Security Archive] requests by a member of the UK parliament and the UK <a href="http://www.extraordinaryrendition.org/">All-Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition</a> [official website], made as part of an <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-counterterrorism-official-criticizes-us-court-decision-on-rendition-information.php">investigation into extrajudicial capture by the US</a> [JURIST report] of foreign terrorism suspects for detention and interrogation. In March in a hearing before the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> (EP) [official website], <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] asked EU member states to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/amnesty-urges-eu-nations-to-investigate-cia-renditions.php">reconsider their involvement in the extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST report], intending to create the foundation of an EP report that will divulge details of a five-year investigation into each nation's involvement in supporting CIA renditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gbagbo is charged with crimes against humanity relating to violence following the 2010 elections in which Gbagbo lost but refused to cede power. Specifically, the ICC has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/icc0211/related%20cases/icc02110111/Pages/icc02110111.aspx">charged Gbagbo</a> [materials] with murder, rape, persecution and "other inhumane acts" related to post-election violence. Wednesday's ruling is in line with an August <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/icc-rejects-ex-ivory-coast-presidents-jurisdiction-challenge.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by Pre-Trial Chamber I.

<p>Last month the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-charges-wife-of-ivory-coasts-ex-president.php">unsealed an indictment</a> [JURIST report] for Gbagbo's wife, Simone, marking the first time that the court has charged a female. Also in November the court found Laurent Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/icc-finds-ivory-coast-ex-president-fit-to-stand-trial-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. In October, the ICC denied Gbagbo's motion <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icc-refuses-to-allow-pre-trial-leave-for-ivory-coast-ex-president.php">asking the court for allowance to leave</a> the Netherlands while he recovers from alleged maltreatment received while detained by national authorities in the Ivory Coast before being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">surrendered to the ICC</a> [JURIST reports] in November. The court denied Gbagbo's leave request upon a determination that he posed a flight risk. The violence that followed the 2010 election claimed approximately 3,000 lives. Gbagbo's rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=alassane+ouattara">news archive</a>] was declared the winner of the 2010 election and is now president. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A group of seven individuals and one organization had challenged the law claiming it would stifle journalists' free speech and association rights. Judge Katherine Forrest of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-blocks-portion-of-anti-terrorism-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of section 1021 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act of 2012</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF] in May, finding that it violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. She then issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-enjoins-indefinite-detention-law.php">permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] in September. However, in October the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-extends-stay-on-order-blocking-indefinite-detention-law.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] Forrest's injunction, allowing the law to take effect while the government's appeal goes forward. Ginsburg can now issue a decision on her own or consult with her colleagues at the Supreme Court.

<p>Section 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA affirms the authority of the president under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to detain indefinitely any "person who was a part of or substantially supported al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces." President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/obama-signs-controversial-defense-bill.php">signed the NDAA into law</a> [JURIST report] on December 31, 2011. Upon signing, he <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/31/statement-president-hr-1540">noted</a> [statement], "I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation." Both houses of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/congress-reaches-agreement-on-controversial-defense-bill.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on the language of the NDAA's most controversial sections in mid-December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justices <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/136/default.aspx">Mehmet Guney</a> of Turkey, <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/131/default.aspx">Khalida Rachid Khan</a> of Pakistan, <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/141/default.aspx">Arlette Ramaroson</a> of Madagascar, <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/210/default.aspx">Bakhtiyar Tuzmukhamedov</a> of the Russian Federation and <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/139/default.aspx">Andresia Vaz</a> [official profiles] of Senegal, all permanent judges of the ICTR Appeals Chamber, will now hold office until the sooner of December 31, 2014, or the completion of the cases to which they are assigned. In the resolution the Security Council also<blockquote>Urges all States, especially States where fugitives are suspected to be at large, to intensify further their cooperation with and render all necessary assistance to the International Tribunal, in particular to achieve the arrest and surrender of all remaining fugitives as soon as possible; ... [and] Commends States that have accepted the relocation of acquitted persons or convicted persons who have completed serving their sentences to their territories, and reiterates its call upon all States in a position to do so to cooperate with and render all necessary assistance to the International Tribunal for its increased efforts towards the relocation of acquitted persons and convicted persons who have completed serving their sentences.</blockquote>The Security Council also requested updates on the transition of functions of the ICTR to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT), set up in December 2010 and mandated it to take over and finish the remaining tasks of the ICTR and <a href="www.icty.org/">International Criminal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] when they are closed after their mandates expire. The resolution urges both tribunals to complete their work by the end of 2014.

<p>Since its founding in 1994 following the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder], the ICTR has indicted 91 individuals and, thus far, finished 50 trials with 29 convictions. In July the ICTR transferred four genocide convicts <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/ictr-transferred-genocide-convicts-to-prison.php">to the Republic of Mali</a> [JURIST report] to serve their sentences. A month earlier the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-transfers-case-to-national-court.php">transferred  the case of Aloys Ndimbati</a> [JURIST report], a former local government official in Rwanda who has been charged with genocide, complicity in genocide, incitement to commit genocide and crimes against humanity including murder, rape and persecution, to the authorities of the Republic of Rwanda. Earlier that month <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/ictr-transfers-fifth-case-to-rwandan-court.php">Bernard Munyagishari's case was the fifth to be transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the country's court system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The dismissal of the judges came after the justices <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/honduran-congress-dismisses-supreme-court-143722720.html">ruled last week</a> [AP report] that a police reform bill supported by the congress and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/porfirio_lobo_sosa/index.html">President Porfirio Lobo</a> [NYT profile] was unconstitutional. Lobo indicated earlier this week that he would seek approval of the law through a referendum despite the Supreme Court decision. It is unclear whether the removal of the justices by congress is constitutional.

<p>Tension between the three branches of government in Honduras has risen recently, and Lobo has expressed concern that he may be forced out of office like his predecessor, who was removed during the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">2009 military coup</a> [JURIST report]. The Honduran Truth and Reconciliation Commission declared last June that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/honduras-truth-commission-says-coup-was-unconstitutional.php">coup was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] but stated that former president Manuel Zelaya was culpable when he ignored orders of the Supreme Court. Zelaya <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/honduras-ex-president-zelaya-signs-agreement-allowing-return-to-country.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] in May 2011 allowing his return to the country after nearly two years in exile. Earlier that month a Honduran court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/honduras-court-dismisses-conspiracy-charges-against-ex-president-zelaya.php">dismissed the two remaining conspiracy charges</a> [JURIST report] against Zelaya, clearing the way for his return to the country. In July 2010 a Honduran court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/honduras-judge-drops-abuse-of-power-charges-against-ousted-leader-zelaya.php">dismissed abuse of power charges</a> against Zelaya after his successor <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/honduras-president-pardons-military.php">granted amnesty</a> [JURIST reports] to Zelaya and those involved in his removal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court determined that the act does not protect information stored on personal devices such as cell phones, laptops and personal computers. The lawsuit was brought by a former police dispatcher who was dismissed after photos and text messages on her cell phone revealed that she was violating police department rules. The plaintiff's cell phone was removed from her locker and searched without her permission. In its decision, the court explained that the SCA only protects "facilit[ies] through which an electronic communication service is provided" and not the device that is used to access those communication services. 

<p>Rapid changes in technology have left legal questions about the extent of digital privacy protection. The Senate Judiciary Committee last month <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/Senate-committee-approves-bill-requiring-warrant-to-search-emails.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prevent police from searching e-mails and other electronic content without a warrant. Currently, law enforcement agents only need a warrant to access e-mails less than six months old. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in September asked the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/aclu-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-rehear-cell-phone-tracking-case.php">reconsider a case</a> [JURIST report]  in which it decided  that police use of GPS tracking on a person's cell phone is not an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment. In July a member of the US House of Representatives released a report showing an <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/wireless-carriers-report-rise-in-data-requests-by-law-enforcement.php">increase in requests by law enforcement</a> [JURIST report] agencies to access cell phone records from major wireless carriers. In March the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/seventh-circuit-upholds-warrantless-cell-phone-search.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a warrantless search of a suspect's cell phone to obtain the suspect's phone number is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Last year a federal court ordered the Department of Justice to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-orders-doj-to-disclose-cell-phone-tracking-case-information.php">release information</a> [JURIST report] about when it had used cell phone location data to track down suspects in a suit filed by the ACLU. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-13/apple-infringes-three-patents-with-the-iphone-jury-says.html">three patents at issue</a> [Bloomberg report] in the case relate to the camera phone, call handling and call rejecting. The court has not scheduled when it will determine damages. MobileMedia is seeking damages for royalties owed for use of these technologies. 

<p>Apple has been involved in numerous patent cases both in the US and internationally. Earlier this month, the judge overseeing the cases between Apple and <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/judge-overseeing-apple-samsung-lawsuits-requests-temporary-ceasefire.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] a "cease fire" <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">between the two parties</a> [JURIST op-ed] on opening new cases against each other. In late November a court in the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/netherlands-court-bans-samsung-smartphones-that-infringe-on-apple-patents.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] Samsung from selling certain products that it found to infringe on Apple patents. Also in November Apple was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/apple-ordered-to-pay-368-million-for-patent-infringement.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] to pay $368 million for patent infringement against <a href="http://virnetx.com/">VirnetX</a> [corporate website]. In October the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] ruled that that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">violated the Tariff Act of 1930</a> [JURIST report] when it infringed four patents held by Apple. Earlier in October the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] an Apple software patent for user input and date manipulation through a "multi-touch" touch screen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Bensouda, the situation in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive] continues to be of serious concern, and the ongoing violence constitutes war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Bensouda urged the Security Council to be more concerned, given that many continuing crimes have already been indicted by the court. She also expressed frustration over the lack of meaningful progress toward arresting those indicted by the court:
<blockquote>This Council referred the situation in Darfur because of its firm belief that the justice process is an essential component of any strategy aimed at truly stopping ongoing crimes and achieving peace in Darfur. We have always believed the referral to be a joint endeavour by this Council and the Court to contribute to lasting peace in Darfur through investigation and prosecution of those who bear the greatest responsibility for the most serious crimes. Indeed, in this and other contexts, this Council has reaffirmed the vital importance of promoting justice and the rule of law, including respect for human rights, as an indispensable element for lasting peace. My Office and the Court as a whole have done their part in executing the mandate given by this Council in accordance with the Rome Statute. The question that remains to be answered is how many more civilians must be killed, injured and displaced for this Council to be spurred into doing its part?</blockquote>Bensouda also noted that the government of Sudan is not prepared to prosecute the suspects, citing an apparement commitment to an ongoing military struggle.

<p>The continued violence has been a major issue in Sudan. In October the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-office-urges-sudan-to-investigate-ambush-on-convoy.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Sudanese government to investigate an attack on one of its convoys, noting that since the establishment of <a href="http://unamid.unmissions.org/">African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur</a> (UNAMID) [official website] in December 2007, 43 peacemakers have been killed. In August 2012 the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/sudan-to-investigate-into-violence-against-protesters-in-darfur.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Sudan to investigate violence against protesters in Darfur. In June the UN  <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-official-calls-on-sudan-government-to-improve-humanitarian-conditions.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] about deteriorating conditions in Sudan due to continued violent conflict. That same month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-rights-chief-urges-sudan-authorities-to-avoid-protest-violence.php">urged Sudanese authorities</a> [JURIST report] to take measures to prevent violence against protesters in upcoming demonstrations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Under North Carolina's <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2009/Bills/Senate/PDF/S461v6.pdf">Racial Justice Act</a> (RJA) [text, PDF], individuals who have received a death sentence may attempt to have that sentence removed by presenting evidence showing that racial bias was a major factor in the death sentence being applied. Weeks found that "race was, in fact, a significant factor in the prosecution's use of peremptory strikes during jury selection" and commuted their death sentences to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. This ruling is the second time the RJA has been applied and has now been used to commute four death sentences. 

<p>The act was first <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/north-carolina-court-vacates-death-sentence-due-to-racial-bias.php">applied</a> [JURIST report] in April. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has been very vocal in its support of the act. It has released press statements after both <a href="http://www.aclu.org/capital-punishment/judge-finds-racial-bias-three-more-death-penalty-cases-north-carolina-under-state">this</a> and the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/capital-punishment/north-carolina-judge-finds-racial-discrimination-death-penalty-commutes-death">April</a> [ACLU press releases] rulings, calling these key steps in affirming that race has no place in capital punishment cases. Cassandra Stubbs, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Capital Punishment Project, said in the statement, "The court sent the unmistakable message that prosecutors must change their jury selection practices if they want to seek the death penalty."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Independent expert Kamala Chandrakirana noted that almost no women were included in the Constituent Assembly that <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/new-egypt-constitution-approved-amid-boycott.php">approved the draft constitution</a> [JURIST report] last month, saying that, "women's perspectives were grossly under-represented in the final draft." The working group expressed concern that equality between the sexes is not among the draft's substantive provisions and urged further critical review:<blockquote>We urge the Egyptian Government to ensure women's full and equal participation in all processes related to the political transition, to guarantee their freedom to express their views, to be protected against violence in their political and public activities and have their voices incorporated in public discourse and in shaping the society. Further, the Government should ensure that the Constitution provides the strongest guarantees to advance equality and women's human rights in line with Egypt's obligations under international law.</blockquote>The group is also seeking clarification on the independence of the judiciary and the role of women in the judicial system.

<p>Last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-turmoil-in-egypt.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] at the rising death toll during the ongoing political chaos in Egypt, saying that Egypt's draft constitution presents serious problems for human rights. Pillay <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&amp;LangID=E">complained</a> [UN News Centre report] that the draft constitution was passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators. Pillay also said that she was concerned about the draft constitution's omission of references to international human rights treaties that Egypt ratified in the past. While Pillay commended the fact that the draft constitution imposes term limits on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] and provides some protections for freedom of expression and religion, she noted that these protections were not strong enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

McKinnon is accused of hacking into NASA, Department of Defense, Air Force, Army and Navy computers in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">US computer laws</a> [18 USC &#167; 1030] but claims he was trying to find evidence of UFO activity and extraterrestrial technologies. In October <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/our-organisation/ministers/home-secretary">Home Secretary Theresa May</a> [official profile] announced that she would <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-to-block-extradition-of-computer-hacker-to-us.php">block</a> [JURIST report] McKinnon's extradition to the US for mental health reasons, leaving it up to CPS to determine whether he would face trial in England and Wales. According to the CPS statement:<blockquote>The potential difficulties in bringing a case in England and Wales now should not be underestimated, not least the passage of time, the logistics of transferring sensitive evidence prepared for a court in the US to London for trial, the participation of US Government witnesses in the trial and the need to fully comply with the duties of disclosure imposed on the CPS. The prospects of a conviction against Mr McKinnon, which reflects the full extent of his alleged criminality, are not high.</blockquote>Accordingly, no new investigation against McKinnon will be initiated.

<p>In 2010 a member of the UK coalition government indicated that McKinnon's extradition to the US would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/uk-to-reconsider-us-extradition-of-alleged-hacker.php">delayed</a> [JURIST report]. May considered an adjournment request from McKinnon's legal team and agreed to delay a scheduled judicial review in order to determine if he was medically fit for extradition. McKinnon was nearly extradited in August 2008 when the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the US. British extradition arrangements, however, kept the case in judicial review for several years. McKinnon was arrested by British police in 2002 and again in 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 7-0 ruling, the court dismissed the appeal brought by <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/khawaja_mohammad.html">Mohammed Momin Khawaja</a> [CBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mohammed+Momin+Khawaja">news archive</a>], the first person ever to be charged under the Anti-Terrorism law. <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/ju/mclachlin/index-eng.asp">Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin</a> [official profile] affirmed that the life sentence handed down by the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Ontario Court of Appeals</a> [official website] sent a "clear and unmistakable message that terrorism is reprehensible and those who choose to engage in it [in Canada] will pay a very heavy price." She also suggested that "denunciation and deterrence, both specific and general, are important principles in the sentencing of terrorism offences, given their seriousness." The court also unanimously <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/decisia-scc-csc/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/12769/1/document.do">upheld</a> [judgment, PDF] the extradition orders for two other men, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2011/01/06/extradition-tamil.html">Suresh Sriskandarajah and Piratheepan Nadarajah</a> [CBC backgrounder], who will be sent to the US for trial on charges of supporting the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1869501,00.html">Tamil Tigers</a> [TIME backgrounder], a banned terrorist group. The rulings essentially confirm that the Anti-Terrorism law, passed in December 2001 in the wake of 9/11 terrorist attacks, contains no rights violations and does not need to be revised.

<p>The Supreme Court of Canada began <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/canada-high-court-begins-review-case-under-anti-terrorism-act.php">reviewing</a> [JURIST report] Khawaja's case in June. The review came after the court announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/china-high-court-to-hear-terror-suspect-appeal.php">granted an application for leave to appeal</a> [JURIST report] filed by Khawaja in June 2011. He was found guilty of participating in a terrorist group, instructing a person to finance terrorism, making property available to terrorists, contributing to a terrorist group and facilitating terrorism. In 2008 Khawaja <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/canada-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges. In 2007 Canadian Federal Court Judge <a href="http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Mosley">Richard Mosley</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/canada-judge-declines-release-of.php">refused to require the release of confidential evidence</a> [JURIST report] against Khawaja, explaining that "disclosure of most of the information would be injurious to national security or to international relations." Khawaja was arrested in 2004.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Obama</a> [docket; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2012/12/indefinite-detention-law-appealed-to-supreme-court.php">report</a>] that would have temporarily blocked enforcement of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act of 2012</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF]. A group of reporters and advocates <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/indefinite-detention-law-appealed-to-supreme-court.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/indefinite-detention-motion.pdf">emergency appeal</a> [text, PDF] with Ginsburg Thursday in the hopes of blocking the law pending consideration by the <a href = "http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website]. Ginsburg, in a note on the docket rather than a published order, denied the application to vacate that order, citing her previous denial of an application to vacate a stay in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05a295.pdf">Doe v. Gonzales</a> [opinion, PDF]:<blockquote>I am mindful, first, that 'interference with an interim order of a court of appeals cannot be justified solely because [a Circuit Justice] disagrees about the harm a party may suffer.' Respect for the assessment of the Court of Appeals is especially warranted when that court is proceeding to adjudication on the merits with due expedition.</blockquote>The NDAA allows for the indefinite detention of suspected terrorists overseas, and opponents of the law claim it would stifle journalists' and activists' free speech and association rights by impinging on their work with terror suspects. Judge Katherine Forrest of the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/federal-judge-blocks-portion-of-anti-terrorism-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of section 1021 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act of 2012</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF] in May, finding that it violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. She then issued a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-enjoins-indefinite-detention-law.php">permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] in September. However, in October the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-extends-stay-on-order-blocking-indefinite-detention-law.php">stayed</a> [JURIST report] Forrest's injunction, allowing the law to take effect while the government's appeal goes forward.

<p>Section 1021(b)(2) of the NDAA affirms the authority of the president under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to detain indefinitely any "person who was a part of or substantially supported al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces." President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/obama-signs-controversial-defense-bill.php">signed the NDAA into law</a> [JURIST report] on December 31, 2011. Upon signing, he <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/31/statement-president-hr-1540">noted</a> [statement], "I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation." Both houses of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/congress-reaches-agreement-on-controversial-defense-bill.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on the language of the NDAA's most controversial sections in mid-December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the law eliminates Cold War era restrictions on trade that will allow better trade relations with Russia, it also directs the <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State</a> [official website] to publish and update a list of each person believed to be responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other human rights violations committed against individuals seeking to promote human rights or to expose illegal activity carried out by Russian officials. Placement on this list allows the State Department to bar admittance to the US and revoke any outstanding visas. Informally known as the Magnitsky Act, a portion of the law specifically calls for sanctions on any individual involved in the prison death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky as well as a Russian tax fraud scheme. <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru">Russian President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ifTJR_NiuSC0kkGDgBkKJjDDYSqQ?docId=CNG.1a7e217111e4906ef1b6b3e54e79e1b0.141">expressed his disapproval</a> [AFP report] of the bill on Friday, and Russian legislators are discussing passing a similar bill in retaliation for the bill's enactment. 

<p>The House Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/house-committee-approves-bill-to-sanction-russia-officials-linked-to-lawyers-death.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an early version of the bill in June. Following the approval, Committee Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen stated, "[The bill] requires that those responsible for the death, torture, or repression of individuals investigating crimes by Russian government officials, or who were simply trying to exercise their basic human rights, be publicly named and sanctioned." Prior to his death, Magnitsky was held in prison for 358 days with little to no access to legal representation, his family or medical professionals. In a controversial move last August, Russian investigators <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/russia-reopens-case-against-dead-lawyer.php">reopened the case</a> [JURIST report] against Magnitsky on the basis of a new ruling permitting criminal cases against the dead. Critics of this action, such as JURIST Contributing Editor David Crane, argue that the ongoing posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky is a <a href="/forum/2012/02/david-crane-posthumous-prosecution.php">violation of the rule of law</a> [JURIST op-ed] and an embarrassment for the Russian judicial system.<br />

Pavlyuchenkov, who was a lieutenant colonel at the time of the murder, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/russia-investigators-arrest-ex-officer-for-politkovskaya-murder.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in August, and pleaded guilty without testifying to his role in the murder. The court found him guilty of tracking Politkovskaya's movements and providing the killer with a gun. He was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20726937">sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> [BBC report]. Five other men are currently <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hHIH5Kf2SraaGBhu7zaovdjhiMgQ?docId=f428e0702d594286b8b4723b5b94e031">indicted</a> [AP report] for involvement in Politkovskaya's murder. 

<p>A human rights activist and critic of the Kremlin, Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in an elevator of her apartment building in Moscow as she was returning home. Politkovskaya investigated human rights abuses in Chechnya and high-level corruption across Russia, and her death raised concerns about the safety of journalists and other critics of the government. Because she was a critic of Russian governmental policies, it was widely speculated at the time of her murder that the Russian government was involved. At the time she was working for the low-circulation independent newspaper <a href="http://www.newtimes.ru/"><em>Novaya Gazeta</em></a> [official website, in Russian] where she was writing reports on Chechnya. Her death was widely believed to be a contract killing. Russia's Federal Security Service <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/russia-authorities-charge-suspect-in-2006-shooting-of-journalist-anna-politkovskaya.php">charged Rustam Makhmudov for the murder</a> [JURIST report] in June 2011. Two of Makhmudov's brothers and a former police officer are currently awaiting trial for the murder in Moscow. A district court <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/=/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya&page=2">acquitted</a> those three men in February 2009 due to a lack of prosecutorial evidence, but the Russian Supreme Court vacated the acquittal and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-court-orders-retrial-for.php">ordered a reinvestigation of the case</a> [JURIST reports].<br />

The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] originally <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1805-200">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] Khairkhwa's petition for <em>habeas corpus</em> on May 27, 2011, finding that Khairkhwa was a senior member of the Taliban, and had served as a Taliban spokesperson, the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister, the Taliban Governor of Kabul and a member of the Taliban's highest governing body, and thus was lawfully detained. On appeal, Khairkhwa argued first, that the government had to demonstrate that he had "fought or engaged in armed conflict or hostilities against the United States or its allies" and second, that if he were released from Guantanamo, he would post a threat in the future to the United States. The appellate court rejected both arguments, stating: <blockquote>In order to detain individuals who were part of the Taliban or al-Qaeda forces, proof that the individuals also actively engaged in combat against the United States and its allies is unnecessary...In modern warfare, commanding officers rarely engage in hand-to-hand combat; supporting troops behind the front lines do not confront enemy combatants face to face; supply-line forces, critical to military operations, may never encounter their opposition. As to Khairkhwa's other point&#8212;that a person may not be detained unless the evidence also shows that he would pose a danger to the United States if released&#8212;<span class=casename>Awad</span> squarely rejected the argument. Khairkhwa recognizes this, but insists that <span class=casename>Awad</span> was wrongly decided.  What he fails to recognize is that one three-judge panel of this court may not overrule another three-judge panel.</blockquote>  Khairkhwa has been detained at Guantanamo for over ten years.

<p><em>Habeas corpus</em> petitions at Guantanamo Bay have generated much controversy. In September, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-rejects-new-restrictions-on-guantanamo-detainees-access-to-counsel.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] new restrictions on lawyers representing Guantanamo Bay detainees who have had their <em>habeas corpus</em> challenges denied or dismissed. Chief Judge Royce Lamberth <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-judge-skeptical-about-new-guantanamo-access-to-counsel-restrictions.php">expressed skepticism about the restrictions</a> [JURIST report], which in some cases require a lawyer to sign a <a href="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Post-Habeas-MOU.pdf">memorandum of understanding</a> (MOU) [memorandum, PDF] to continue to be able to meet with a client, making any meetings or communications with a client "subject to the authority and discretion" of the Guantanamo commanding officer. In August the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/doj-argues-continued-attorney-access-at-guantanamo-is-government-decision.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the court asserting that the government should decide when a Guantanamo prisoner is granted continued regular access to legal counsel absent a detainee's ongoing <em>habeas</em> or other legal challenge. The challenge to the new restrictions was brought by six Guantanamo detainees, two of whose <em>habeas</em> petitions were denied and four dismissed with the possibility of reconsideration. At the time of the hearing lawyers for only six of the 170 detainees at Guantanamo had signed the MOU. In the 10 years since the first detainees were brought to Guantanamo Bay, only a handful have been tried or convicted, and in the past few months there have been several calls by the UN and various foreign governments for some long-held Guantanamo detainees to be returned to their home countries, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/egypt-requests-release-of-its-last-citizen-held-at-guantanamo.php">Egypt</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-official-calls-for-transfer-of-khadr-to-canada.php">Canada</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/kuwait-lawyer-sues-government-officials-for-release-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">Kuwait</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

While Aamer has been cleared for release from Guantanamo, he has not been returned to the UK yet. Aamer was detained in Afghanistan for allegedly fighting at an al-Qaeda stronghold, which Aamer denies, stating that he was performing charity work. Among the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20715511">false information</a> [BBC report] his lawyers claim the US interrogators received were allegations that Osama bin Laden directly paid Aamer and that Aamer had recruited fighters for al-Qaeda. Aamer's lawsuit is being brought by <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website], a legal charity focused on prisoners' rights.  The suit names <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/william-hague">Foreign Secretary William Hague</a> [official website], who supervises MI6, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/theresa-may">Home Secretary Theresa May</a> [official website], who supervises MI5. The lawsuit is also <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/press/2012_12_14_frankieboyle_shakeraamer_to_sue_mi5_mi6/">receiving support</a> [press release] from British comedian Frankie Boyle. Aamer is originally from Saudi Arabia, but is married to a British citizen, and has four British children. He had been given permission to live in the UK indefinitely when he was arrested in 2001. 

<p>Aamer is the last UK resident being held at Guantanamo, and he was the center of a high-profile <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] campaign pushing for him to receive a fair trial or to be released so he may return to his family in the UK. AI has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-chides-prolonged-detention-of-uk-man-in-guantanamo.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] the detention Aamer at Guantanamo Bay, calling it a "mockery of justice." In November 2011 AI <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/rights-group-calls-for-release-of-last-uk-guantanamo-detainee.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US and the UK to work towards the release of Aamer. AI UK Director Kate Allen called on Hague and US officials to give a specific timetable for Aamer's release. The Hague and the US have been in discussions over Aamer's release, but no formal indications of a release have been made. The UK agrees that if Aamer is released, they will be wiling to accept him, as they did with former detainee <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php">Binyam Mohammed</a> [JURIST report]. Aamer is one of 16 Guantanamo Bay detainees for whom the UK government announced a <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] for allegations of torture. Those allegations prompted the UK to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-government-settles-with-16-guantanamo-detainees-over-torture-allegations.php">launch an investigation</a> into torture allegations in May 2010, as well as issue a ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/uk-appeals-court-denies-use-of-secret-evidence-in-detainee-torture-case.php">state intelligence agencies cannot use secret evidence</a> [JURIST reports] in their defense against abuse. Aamer has been described as an activist within Guantanamo, negotiating with US military officials over camp conditions and organizing hunger strikes when conditions did not improve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The county judges, Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan, were accused of taking bribes from Robert Mericle, a real estate developer who built youth detention centers, in exchange for wrongfully incarcerating the juveniles. The settlement Friday was only with Mericle, but both judges are named as defendants in the civil case as well. Most of the 1,600 minors and parents involved will receive from the settlement between $500 and $5,000 dollars each. Ciavarella and Conahan were both convicted of multiple counts including racketeering, money laundering and conspiracy following separate criminal trials last year. Ciavaralla was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/pennsylvania-judge-sentenced-to-28-years-for-juvenile-sentencing-scandal.php">28 years</a> and Conahan was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/former-pennsylvania-judge-sentenced-to-17-12-years-in-federal-prison.php">17 1/2 years</a> [JURIST reports] for their involvement in the scandal. Mericle is currently <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/pam/Victim_Witness/Luzerne_County_Corruption/Mericle/mericle_index.html">awaiting a criminal trial</a> [case profile] for charges of concealing and failing to report a felony and conspiracy to defraud the US of income taxes.

<p>In 2010, federal prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pennsylvania-prosecutor-will-not-retry.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that they would not retry juveniles after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 2009 <a href="http://www.courts.state.pa.us/OpPosting/Supreme/out/81mm2008pco6.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/pennsylvania-court-overturns-thousands.php">report</a>] more than 6,000 juvenile convictions issued by Ciavarella between 2003 and 2008. The ruling came weeks after Ciavarella and Conahan were <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/former-pennsylvania-judges-indicted-in.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] by a federal grand jury. Both judges <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pennsylvania-judges-in-juvenile.php">withdrew guilty pleas</a> months earlier after a federal judge <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/25/us/25judge.html?_r=1">rejected their plea agreement</a> [NYTimes report, JURIST <a href="/forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">op-ed</a>], stating that the prison sentences would be too lenient.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Senior <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] leader and US citizen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=awlaki">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-awlaqi.php">killed by drone strike</a> [JURIST report] last September along with another American, Samir Khan. Two weeks later drone strikes killed 16-year-old Abdulrahman Al-Awlaki, Anwar Al-Awlaki's son. The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-sue-over-deaths-from-cia-drone-strikes.php">filed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], naming as defendants Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, CIA Director David Petraeus, Adm. William McRaven, Commander of the US Special Operations Command and Gen. Joseph Votel, Commander of the Joint Special Operations Command. According to the defendants' motion:<blockquote>courts repeatedly have recognized that the political branches, with few exceptions, have both the responsibility for&#8212;and the oversight of&#8212;the defense of the Nation and the conduct of armed conflict abroad. The Judiciary rarely interferes in such arenas. In this case, Plaintiffs ask this Court to take the extraordinary step of substituting its own judgment for that of the Executive. They further ask this Court to create a novel damages remedy, despite the fact that&#8212;based on Plaintiffs' own complaint&#8212;their claims are rife with separation-of-powers, national defense, military, intelligence, and diplomatic concerns. Judicial restraint is particularly appropriate here, where Plaintiffs seek non-statutory damages from the personal resources of some of the highest officials in the U.S. defense and intelligence communities. Under these weighty circumstances, this Court should follow the well-trodden path the Judiciary&#8212;and particularly the D.C. Circuit&#8212;have taken in the past and should leave the issues raised by this case to the political branches.</blockquote>The ACLU issued a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/us-asks-court-not-consider-targeted-killing-challenge">statement</a> [text] condemning the government's motion.

<p>Awlaki, a dual US-Yemeni citizen, had been approved for targeting killing by the Obama administration, an action that was challenged based on Awlaki's US citizenship. In December 2010 a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST reports] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct "targeted killings" in al-Awlaki's case. Judge John Bates found that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, filed by the ACLU and the CCR on behalf of Awlaki's father, dismissing it on procedural grounds and noting that important questions remain. Bates <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-hears-arguments-in-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November 2010 on the same day Awlaki called for jihadist attacks on US citizens in a video posted on extremist websites. Earlier that month Yemeni prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/yemen-charges-us-born-cleric-with-terrorism-related-activities.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Awlaki with incitement to kill foreigners, and he was later sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to 10 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill must still be passed by the Senate and signed by the president before it becomes law. The Catholic Church, which remains an influential institution in the Philippines where 80 percent of the population is Catholic, opposes the bill, arguing that it will lead to the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/17/world/asia/philippines-health-bill/index.html">destruction of marriage and morality</a> [CNN report] in the country. Philippines House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte called the passage of the bill <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/press/details.php?pressid=6663">"historic"</a> [press release] after it had been pending for 13 years.

<p>The right to sex education and contraceptives, particularly funding issues, continues to be a global issue. In October France <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/france-house-passes-bill-to-pay-for-abortions-contraceptives-for-minors.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to pay for contraceptive and abortion coverage for minors. The day before that, a US federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to rehear a Texas Planned Parenthood funding case. In September an Illinois appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/illinois-appeals-court-rules-pharmacists-can-refuse-to-dispense-birth-control-drugs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that pharmacists can refuse to dispense birth control drugs. In May the <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/">Tennessee House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a bill that augments the state's abstinence-only sex education curriculum to allow parents to sue school teachers or organizations that promote <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/tennessee-legislature-passes-abstinence-only-sex-education-bill.php">"gateway sexual activity"</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-high-court-rejects-religious.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] on religious grounds to mandatory sex education.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The groups, including the <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/?lang=en">Cairo Institute for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website], claim that there was a lack of judicial supervision at the polling places and intentional delays at several women's polling places, rendering them unable to vote. Results from Saturday's referendum, which took place in about half of the voting districts, show a lead for the "yes" vote after the first round, with a second and final round scheduled to take place in the remaining districts next Saturday. The rights groups also, "call[ed] upon the Supreme Elections Commission to avoid these irregularities in the second round."

<p>The <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2012.09.20_-_draft_constitution_-_english.pdf">draft constitution</a> [text, PDF] is backed by the Islamists and has been extremely controversial. Last week the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on discrimination against women</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-womens-rights-experts-concerned-over-egypt-draft-constitution.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] over the draft constitution. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has also expressed concern at the rising death toll during the ongoing political chaos in Egypt, saying that Egypt's draft constitution <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-turmoil-in-egypt.php">presents serious problems for human rights</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&amp;LangID=E">complained</a> [UN News Centre report] that the draft constitution was passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators. Pillay also said that she was concerned about the draft constitution's omission of references to international human rights treaties that Egypt ratified in the past. While Pillay commended the fact that the draft constitution imposes term limits on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohammed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder] and provides some protections for freedom of expression and religion, she noted that these protections were not strong enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The move was in response to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/12/20121216201619436647.html">growing lawlessness</a> [Al Jazeera report] in Libya's southern provinces of Ghadames, Ghat, Obari, Al-Shati, Sebha, Murzuq and Kufra. Representatives of the southern provinces had been boycotting legislative sessions due to the government's failure to assist them in curbing the lawlessness in the region. Government officials indicated that the closure would only last until order has restored to the region. There was indication that some of the problems in the southern provinces were due to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-mali-islamists-abusing-human-rights.phphttp://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/10/un-official-mali-islamists-abusing-human-rights.php">deteriorating conditions in Mali</a> [JURIST report] and the expected resulting international military response.

<p>Violence and abuse in Libya has been a concern in the aftermath of the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST feature]. In November Amnesty International (AI) reported that undocumented foreign nationals in Libya are at risk of <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/rights-group-reports-abuse-of-undocumented-foreign-nationals-in-libya.php">facing mental and physical exploitation</a> [JURIST report] and abuse that may include torture due to the Libyan perception that foreigners were mercenaries that supported the ousted regime.

In March AI released a report accusing the ruling <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/libya-leaders-abusing-torturing-gaddafi-supporters-ai.php">allowing the abuse and torture</a> [JURIST report] of supporters of former leader Gaddafi by unofficial militias.

The NCUA brought suit acting in its capacity as Liquidating Agent of multiple credit unions: US Credit, Western Corporate, Southwest Corporate and Members United Corporate. Defendants, as underwriters, sellers and/or issuers of certain residential mortgage-backed securities, allegedly violated federal and state laws in the sale of $3.6 billion of these securities by offering untrue statements, misrepresenting and omitting material facts. This suit is the largest the agency has filed to date and claims the misrepresentations caused the credit unions to believe there was a minimal risk of loss. NCUA Board Chairman Debbie Matz <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/News/Pages/NW20121217JPMorgan.aspx">stated</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Bear, Stearns was one of several Wall Street firms that sold faulty securities to corporate credit unions, leading to their collapse and enormous losses across the industry. Firms like Bear, Stearns acted unfairly by ignoring the rules for underwriting. They packaged these securities and then told buyers the paper was sound. When the securities plunged in value, we learned the truth. NCUA is now working to hold these underwriters accountable and secure recoveries on behalf of federally insured credit unions. ... NCUA and credit unions have successfully worked together to restore stability to the credit union system. Now we are holding responsible parties like Bear, Stearns accountable for their actions. It&#8217;s the right thing to do.</blockquote>The NCUA has a statutory duty to seek recovery from responsible parties and has eight similar actions pending against firms like Bear Stearns. 

<p>These firms have faced numerous lawsuits regarding their business practices. In July JPMorgan agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/jpmorgan-agrees-to-100-million-settlement-in-credit-card-case.php">$100 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a suit brought by customers claiming unreasonable fees and a three percent increase on monthly minimum payments by credit card holders. In early June the firm was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-grants-preliminary-approval-for-jpmorgan-settlement.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] permission to pay $44.6 million to resolve allegations of fraudulent bidding practices for state and local government investment securities at taxpayers' expense. The settlement followed JPMorgan's <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/jpmorgan-chase-agrees-to-pay-$228-million-for-fraudulent-bidding-on-municipal-bonds.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] last July with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] to pay $228 million to federal and state authorities. One month earlier JPMorgan again <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] at $153.6 million for fraud charges brought by the SEC for misleading investors during the housing crises. In July 2010 <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> [corporate website] agreed to a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/goldman-sachs-reaches-record-550-million-settlement-with-sec.php">$550 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the SEC to resolve similar charges. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-sues-montana-for-recognition-of-same-sex-civil-unions.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in July 2010 on behalf of six same-sex couples alleging that state law prohibited them from benefiting from relationship and family protections and obligations automatically provided by law to different-sex couples who marry. In <a href="/hotline/2011/09/betsy-griffing-montana-suit.php">Donaldson and Guggenheim v. State of Montana</a> [JURIST comment; JURIST <a href="/forum/2011/12/shannon-gilreath-gay-liberation.php">op-ed</a>] the plaintiffs sought legal recognition for same-sex couples despite a 2004 voter approved amendment that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Montana's <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/locator/dist1.mcpx">First Judicial District Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed the suit</a> [JURIST report] in April 2011. The ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-sues-montana-for-recognition-of-same-sex-civil-unions.php">appealed the decision</a> [JURIST report], but on Monday the state's highest court affirmed the ruling, finding plaintiffs' claim overly broad:<blockquote>It is the opinion of this Court that the broad injunction and declaratory judgment sought by Plaintiffs would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to this proceeding. Instead, a broad injunction and declaration not specifically directed at any particular statute would lead to confusion and further litigation. As the District Court aptly stated: "For this Court to direct the legislature to enact a law that would impact an unknown number of statutes would launch this Court into a roiling maelstrom of policy issues without a constitutional compass." ... Broadly determining the constitutionality of a "statutory scheme" that may, according to Plaintiffs, involve hundreds of separate statutes, is contrary to established jurisprudence ... [T]he Plaintiffs chose to pursue an overly broad request ... without developing a factual record in the District Court and without identifying a specific statute or statutes that impose the discrimination they allege.</blockquote>The court also suggested that plaintiffs file a new complaint challenging the constitutionality of specific laws and statutes, and plaintiffs have <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/montana-supreme-court_n_2317899.html">pledged to do so</a> [AP report].

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is a contentious issue across the US with several cases currently pending at both the state and federal level. The US Supreme Court in early-December <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in two cases dealing with same-sex marriage, including challenges to the legality of a California referendum and the Defense of Marriage Act. Also in early Decemeber, Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/washington-governor-certifies-same-sex-marriage-referendum.php">certified the results of Referendum 74</a> [JURIST report] which legalized same-sex marriage in the state. In the same time frame, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, a non-profit corporation in Nevada which opposes same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-asked-to-review-nevada-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">petitioned the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] to grant <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause requires Nevada to change its definition of marriage from the union of a man and a woman to the union of two persons. In November, the office of the Maryland Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maryland-ag-releases-opinion-on-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">released an opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that same-sex couples can obtain marriage licenses, allowing Maryland to become the ninth US state to allow same sex marriage after <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/maine-maryland-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Maine</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/washington-voters-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">Washington</a> enacted similar measures [JURIST reports] in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jennifer and Jessica Buntemeyer, a legally married couple, sued the state of Iowa to include both women's names on the death certificate after Jessica gave birth to a still-born son. In his ruling, District Judge Robert Hutchinson wrote that same-sex parents should be treated the same way as their opposite-sex counterparts:<blockquote>[The Iowa Department of Public Health] registers a mother's husband on a Certificate because he is a male parent. ... Both partners in a same-sex relationship can also qualify as parents, at least in the ordinary and common sense. ... Therefore, a mother's wife is a female parent. ... The precise legal consequences accompanying her parentage are undefined at this time. However, as explained above, a Certificate uses ordinary and common terms to define the non-gestational parent instead of any specialized legal definitions. For now, it is sufficient to state a mother's wife and a mother's husband are both parents in the ordinary and common sense. ...

Ngudjolo was accused of commanding fighters in a 2003 rebel attack on Bogoro, a strategic village in the mineral-rich Ituri region in eastern Congo. Some 200 people, including children, were raped and killed in the attack, carried out with machetes. The judges ruled the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Ngudjolo was responsible for the crimes committed, and ordered his immediate release.

The resolution passed with 14 votes in favor, none opposed and one abstention by the Russian Federation. The terms have been extended until the end of 2013 or the completion of their cases, whichever comes first. In addition to extending the judges' terms, the resolution also asks for a comprehensive plan on the ICTY's completion strategy by April 15 and urges states to cooperate fully with the tribunal. Last week the Security Council also extended the terms of the judges of the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website].

<p>Since its establishment in 1993, the ICTY has indicted 161 people for violations of humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 2001.

Earlier this month the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/icty-upholds-life-sentence-for-bosnian-serb-commander.php">upheld the life sentence of Milan Lukic</a> [JURIST report], a Bosnian Serb commander who was sentenced to life in prison for crimes that include burning more than 100 people alive during the 1992 Bosnian War. In November the tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/war-crimes-tribunal-acquits-former-kosovo-liberation-army-commander.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] former Kosovo Liberation Army commanders Ramush Haradinaj, Idriz Balaj and Laji Brahimaj of war crimes related to abduction and torture of civilians.

The legislation is intended to put Ireland in compliance with a 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] which held that Ireland failed to provide "effective and accessible procedures" to allow a Lithuanian women to assert her constitutional right to a lawful abortion. Said <a href="http://www.dohc.ie/about_us/ministers/">Health Minister Dr James Reilly</a> [official website]:<blockquote>I know that most people have personal views on this matter. However, the Government is committed to ensuring that the safety of pregnant women in Ireland is maintained and strengthened. We must fulfill our duty of care towards them. For that purpose, we will clarify in legislation and regulation what is available by way of treatment to a woman when a pregnancy gives rise to a threat to a woman's life. We will also clarify what is legal for the professionals who must provide that care while at all times taking full account of the equal right to life of the unborn child.</blockquote>Tuesday's announcement comes shortly after the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741">death of Savita Halappanavar</a> [BBC report], a 31-year-old dentist who was denied a potentially life saving abortion in Ireland, which has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. Following her death, Ireland's <a href="http://www.gilmore.ie/">Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ireland-deputy-pm-promises-to-clarify-abortion-laws-following-death.php">pledged</a> [JURIST report] to bring "legal clarity" to the country's abortion laws.

<p>Abortion remains a controversial issue around the world. In October the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/europe-rights-court-rules-against-poland-in-abortion-rape-case.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Poland's treatment of a 14-year-old rape victim who sought an abortion. Also that month Uruguay's president signed a bill to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uruguay-president-signs-bill-legalizing-abortion.php">legalize abortion</a> [JURIST report] in that country. In August South Korea's Constitutional Court ruled that the nation's 59-year-old ban on abortions is <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/south-korea-court-upholds-abortion-ban.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In April the Brazilian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/brazil-high-court-legalizes-abortion-of-brain-damaged-fetuses.php">overturned the ban</a> [JURIST report] against abortion of brain-damaged fetuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US District Judge Lucy Koh concluded that Apple had not presented sufficient evidence to show that patented features on the iPhone drove consumer demand for the smartphone:<blockquote>Though Apple does have some interest in retaining certain features as exclusive to Apple, it does not follow that entire products must be forever banned from the market because they incorporate, among their myriad features, a few narrow protected functions. Especially given the lack of causal nexus, the fact that none of the patented features is core to the functionality of the accused products makes an injunction particularly inappropriate here.</blockquote>Samsung also announced Tuesday that it would <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/samsung-drops-apple-injunction-bids-europe-162504940--finance.html">no longer pursue requests to ban sales</a> [AP report] of Apple products in Europe.

<p>Apple has been involved in numerous patent cases both in the US and internationally. Earlier this month, Koh <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/judge-overseeing-apple-samsung-lawsuits-requests-temporary-ceasefire.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] a "cease fire" <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php">between the two parties</a> [JURIST op-ed] on opening new cases against each other. In late November a court in the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/netherlands-court-bans-samsung-smartphones-that-infringe-on-apple-patents.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] Samsung from selling certain products that it found to infringe on Apple patents. Also in November Apple was <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/apple-ordered-to-pay-368-million-for-patent-infringement.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] to pay $368 million for patent infringement against <a target="_blank" href="http://virnetx.com/">VirnetX</a> [corporate website]. In October the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] ruled that that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">violated the Tariff Act of 1930</a> [JURIST report] when it infringed four patents held by Apple. Earlier in October the Dutch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website, in Dutch] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] an Apple software patent for user input and date manipulation through a "multi-touch" touch screen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ's antitrust division <a href="http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f282100/282135.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/doj-accuses-apple-publishers-of-e-book-price-fixing-conspiracy.php">report</a>] in April accusing Penguin Group, as well as several other publishers, of conspiring with <a href="http://apple.com">Apple, Inc.</a> to force e-book prices above the $9.99 charged by <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com, Inc.</a> [corporate websites]. In the press release, the DOJ declared that the settlement will impose the following penalties on Penguin Group:<blockquote>Penguin will terminate its agreements with Apple and other e-books retailers and will be prohibited for two years from entering into new agreements that constrain retailers' ability to offer discounts or other promotions to consumers to encourage the sale of the Penguin's e-books. The proposed settlement agreement also will impose a strong antitrust compliance program on Penguin, which will include a requirement that it provide advance notification to the department of any e-book ventures it plans to undertake jointly with other publishers and that it regularly report to the department on any communications it has with other publishers.</blockquote>The settlement is awaiting approval from the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website].

<p>The DOJ lawsuit against Penguin Group, Apple and several other publishers is similar to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-apple-major-publishers-of-collusion.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed in August in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website]. The lawsuit claims that Apple's conduct constitutes violations of federal and state antitrust laws, including the <a href="http://www.stolaf.edu/people/becker/antitrust/statutes/sherman.html">Sherman Act</a>, the <a href="http://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/3400/">Cartwright Act</a> and the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&group=17001-18000&file=17200-17210">Unfair Competition Act</a> [texts]. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html">European Commission for Competition</a> [official website] announced in December that it will <a href="paperchase/2011/12/eu-antitrust-commission-to-investigate-apple-e-book-dealings.php">investigate Apple for anti-competitive practices</a> [JURIST report] in connection with its dealings with several publishers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Police can also be required to undergo drug tests and investigations into their personal finances.

<p>Tension between the three branches of government in Honduras has risen recently, and Lobo has expressed concern that he may be forced out of office like his predecessor, who was removed during the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">2009 military coup</a> [JURIST report].

The probe <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43804&Cr=democratic&Cr1=congo#.UNHZUbZZ_-k">focused on alleged human rights violations</a> [UN News Centre report] that occurred between November 20 and November 30 in the town of Minova in the province of North Kivu, which the rebel group <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=m23">23 March Movement</a> (M23) [JURIST news archive] occupied on November 19. According to the probe, both M23 rebels and DRC soldiers were responsible for the rapes and other violence that occurred in Minova last month. The <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] estimated that nearly 400 women and girls have been sexually assaulted during recent fighting in North Kivu. The UN has urged all sides of the DRC conflict to refrain from harming civilians. A UN report detailing the findings of the probe is scheduled to be released in January.

<p>The UN has been increasingly concerned about the actions of M23 against civilians over the past several months. Last month the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-concerned-for-civilians-affected-by-fighting-in-congo.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] for Congolese civilians displaced by fighting in North Kivu. Earlier in November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] also <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/11/paperchase/2012/11/un-concerned-over-human-rights-violations-in-eastern-drc.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for civilians in Eastern DRC caught in the continued fighting between the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) and M23. This was a concern she had <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/conflict-in-drc-threatens-civilians-un-rights-chief.php">previously voiced in June</a> [JURIST report], stating that civilians have been in heightened danger since the fighting began. In an emergency meeting on Saturday, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] reiterated its <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-security-council-condemns-guerrilla-attacks-in-the-DRC.php">condemnation of M23</a> [JURIST report] after a series of guerrilla attacks that displaced 4,000 civilians. It called for an end to all support for the rebel group and demanded that M23 end its attacks. The Security Council had <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/security-council-reaffirms-condemnation-of-democratic-republic-of-congo-renegade-soldiers.php">previously condemned M23</a> [JURIST report] in early August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Motorola Mobility <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_745_Notice05042012.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [ITC backgrounder, PDF] against Apple in May, alleging that Apple infringed on its touchscreen sensor patent. In August the ITC <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-itc-judge-sides-with-apple-against-google-on-motorola-phone-patent-20121219,0,5635315.story">ruled</a> [Reuters report] that Apple had not infringed on several of Motorola's other patents. The same judge held on Tuesday that Motorola's touchscreen patent infringement claim was invalid. A full panel of the ITC is scheduled to review Tuesday's ruling soon.

<p>The ITC has been deeply involved in smartphone patent litigation recently. Two weeks ago, Swedish telecom company <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/us">Ericsson</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/ericsson-seeks-to-ban-import-of-samsung-products.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the ITC against <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> [corporate website] seeking an import ban on Samsung's Galaxy line of products. In October the ITC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/us-trade-commission-rules-samsung-infringed-four-apple-patents.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Samsung violated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1337">Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930</a> [text; ITC backgrounder] when it infringed four intellectual property patents held by Apple. In September an ITC judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/us-trade-commission-rules-apple-products-do-not-infringe-on-samsung-patents.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that Apple products do not infringe on Samsung patents. In May the ITC <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/us-trade-commission-finds-motorola-phones-infringed-on-microsoft-patent.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that Motorola phones infringe on a patent held by Microsoft. In August Motorola filed a lawsuit with the ITC <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/googles-motorola-mobility-division-sues-apple-for-patent-infringement.php">alleging</a> [JURIST report] that Apple infringed on seven of its patents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ accused former traders Tom Hayes and Roger Darin of assisting in a conspiracy to manipulate the <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2012/068.aspx">London Interbank Offered Rate</a> (LIBOR) [Bank of England backgrounder], an interest rate used to assess the value of financial products and transactions around the world. In the press release, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] detailed the charges against Hayes and Darin:<blockquote>By causing UBS and other financial institutions to spread false and misleading information about LIBOR, these alleged conspirators&#8212;and others at UBS&#8212;manipulated the benchmark interest rate upon which many consumer financial products&#8212;including credit cards, student loans, and mortgages&#8212;are frequently based. They defrauded the company's counterparties of millions of dollars. And they did so primarily to reap increased profits, and secure bigger bonuses, for themselves.</blockquote>The DOJ also announced plans to file criminal charges against UBS Securities Japan, a subsidiary of UBS, for participating in the scheme to manipulate LIBOR. 

<p><a href="/jurist_search.php?q=UBS">UBS</a> [JURIST news archive] has been involved in many legal disputes in recent years. In September the US <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/irs-awards-104-million-to-swiss-bank-tax-whistleblower.php">awarded $104 million</a> [JURIST report] to a former UBS banker for his role in uncovering that UBS helped American clients shelter assets from US tax liability.

In July 2010 a Swiss court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/switzerland-court-approves-transfer-of-ubs-client-data-to-us.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/us-swiss-agreement.pdf">an agreement</a> [text, PDF] with the US, allowing UBS to disclose account information of clients suspected by the US government of tax evasion, is binding.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto//frontscales.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Former federal judge <a href = "http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=216&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na">Robert Bork</a> [official profile] died Wednesday at the age of 85. Bork was an influential judge for the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for seven years and was a strong proponent of the legal theory of <A href = "http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/interp.html">originalism</A> [backgrounder], an interpretive principle that instructs judges to seek the "original intent" when interpreting the US Constitution. Bork was nominated to the US Supreme Court in 1987 by then-president Ronald Reagan to succeed retiring justice Lewis Powell, a well known moderate and "swing vote" on the court, while Bork was seen as staunchly conservative. The nomination went notoriously poorly and became one of the first Supreme Court nomination processes to be dominated by the media. Several advocacy groups lobbied against Bork, and his judicial record and personal life was scrutinized, including his wife's Catholic beliefs. Bork testified bluntly and openly disagreed with the reasoning of <span class="casename">Roe v. Wade</span>, which only incited liberal advocacy groups to rally against him harder. Bork eventually lost the nomination by a vote of 42 to 58. After another failed nomination of Douglas Ginsburg, Reagan successfully nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy. Bork resigned his position on the DC Circuit shortly after the Senate hearings and worked for conservative think-tanks and as a legal scholar. After his failed Senate confirmation, the word <a href = "http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bork">bork</a> [OED backgrounder] came to mean, "obstruct (someone, especially a candidate for public office) by systematically defaming or vilifying them."

<p>Bork served in several positions in the US Government, including as one of former president Richard Nixon's Solicitor Generals. Bork aided the <a href = "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/102173-2.htm">Saturday Night Massacre</a> [WP report], as acting Attorney General by firing Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox. Before that, Bork was known as the eminent authority on antitrust law, and his book <a href = "http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Antitrust_Paradox.html?id=YmUkAQAAIAAJ">The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War with Itself</a> [Google backgrounder] is credited with creating a shift in antitrust law interpretation by suggesting that mergers benefit consumers, and consumers should be seen as the driving force in antitrust cases. Justice Antonin Scalia, a former colleague of Bork's from the DC Circuit, issued a <a href = "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2012/12/19/reactions-robert-bork-a-titan-in-the-legal-field/">statement</a> [WSJ report] on Bork's passing, praising his insight on antitrust and constitutional law and commending him as a good man and loyal citizen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ngirabatware was found guilty on charges of genocide, incitement to commit genocide and rape as a crime against humanity. ICTR Chief Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow issued a <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/155/Default.aspx?id=1336">statement</a> [text] following the judgment:<blockquote>The delivery of judgement today in this case marks a historic occasion and important mile stone in the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). For today the Tribunal has completed the trial phase of its mandate. ...  We hope that the ICTR has through the execution of its mandate made a difference: a difference in ensuring accountability for those who played a leading role in the tragedy of 1994 in Rwanda; in contributing to justice, reconciliation and respect for the rule of law in Rwanda in demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of the process of international legal accountability for international crimes; in providing through its extensive jurisprudence as well as from the lessons learnt from its operations the framework for a more effective system of international criminal justice.</blockquote>Ngirabatware's <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rwanda-tribunal-begins-genocide-trial.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. German authorities <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/rwanda-war-crimes-suspect-arrested-in.php">arrested</a> Ngirabatware in 2007 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/rwandan-genocide-suspect-transferred.php">transferred</a> [JURIST reports] him to the ICTR, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Ngirabatware had been a fugitive since 2001, when the ICTR issued a warrant for his arrest.

<p>Despite the completion of its trial mandate, the ICTR still has numerous appeals pending.

Both are now <A href = "http://rt.com/news/khodorkovsky-lebedev-term-reduced-479/">eligible for release in 2014</a> [RIA Novosti report], with Lebedev expected to be released in August and Khodorkovsky in October. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are each serving prison sentences for fraud, theft and money laundering. Khodorkovsky has denied all the charges and maintains that he was falsely convicted as retribution for funding opposition parties during a former presidency of current <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">President Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile]. Last month it was <a href = "/paperchase/2012/11/russia-court-reduces-sentence-for-khodorkovsky-partner.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Lebedev's sentence had been reduced to 10 years with potential release in the coming summer, but the latest order modifies that to 11 years.

<p>In July a senior Russian judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/russia-judge-orders-court-review-of-khodorkovsky-appeal.php">ordered a court to review</a> [JURIST report] Khodorkovsky's appeal. Opposition leaders and other groups have shown skepticism about the validity of Khodorkovsky's sentence. In December the Russia Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights under President Dmitry Medvedev called for the prosecutor general to petition to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/russia-rights-council-condemns-khodorkovsky-conviction.php">annul the conviction</a> [JURIST report]. Describing the verdict as fictitious, council member and former Constitutional Court judge, Tamara Morshchakova, noted the council found neither evidence nor substance to the charges brought against Khodorkovsky in the second trial. The council's decisions are non-binding and have seldom elicited action from Russian authorities. In July the council urged amnesty for economic crimes in a meeting with Medvedev that would include amnesty for the crimes of Khodorkovsky. Last year former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/%22">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister Vladimir Putin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the Communist Party without first getting approval to do so from the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report will be sent to the <a href="http://www.conseil-national.medecin.fr/">National Order of Physicians</a> [official website, in French], France's national council on medical ethics, which will <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20121219-france-medically-assisted-suicide-euthanasia-healthcare-reform-hollande">determine the situations</a> [France 24 report] in which it would be appropriate for doctors to aid patients in accelerating death. The new report was produced by senior medical professor Doctor Didier Sicard, who recommended that doctors should be permitted to accelerate death under three circumstances: when patients can or have previously given explicit requests; when the patient is unconscious and the patient's family requests a withdrawal of life-support or nourishment; and when treatment is merely keeping a body in a vegetative state alive. French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Francois Hollande</a> [official website, in French] commissioned the report as a fulfillment of a campaign pledge. France could draft preliminary legislation by June 2013. 

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue around the world.  A UK High Court justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/uk-court-allows-euthanasia-case-to-proceed.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] in March to let Britian's first right to die case proceed, the first to be allowed in British court. Tony Nicklinson, age 57, suffered a paralyzing stroke and challenged the UK's definition of murder as including seeking medical assistance in committing suicide. The only European countries that allow euthanasia are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In 2011 an Indian high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/india-high-court-rules-passive-euthanasia-permitted-under-certain-circumstances.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] passive euthanasia was permitted under certain circumstances. In 2010 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that removing a patient from life support would not be a criminal offense if the patient had previously given consent. In 2009 the Italian president <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-president-blocks-measure-to-stop.php">refused to sign</a> [JURIST report] an Italian governmental decree that would stop the euthanasia of comatose women because it would violate the separation of power overturning a previous court ruling. In 200, a proposed bill that would legalize the option of assisted suicide in the UK was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-lords-put-aside-controversial.php">set aside</a> by the House of Lords following <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/british-doctors-reject-proposed.php">opposition from the public and two physician groups</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law allows Senegal President Macky Sall to ratifying an <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/african-union-senegal-create-special-tribunal-to-try-former-chad-dictator.php">accord</a> [JURIST report] made in August with the <a href="http://www.au.int/en/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] that will create the tribunal. The accord calls for "Extraordinary African Chambers" to be created inside the existing Senegalese court structure in Dakar that will have sections to handle investigations, trials and appeals. Rights groups <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/africa/2012/12/19/senegal-gov-adopts-law-try-chad-dictator/S4r8EOtmwPyhhyZhoHw5KN/story.html">pushed for Habre's trial</a> [AP report] through the presidency of  former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16905528">Abdoulaye Wade</a> [BBC backgrounder], who was accused of purposely avoiding Habre's trial. Habre was Chad's president from 1982 through 1990. In the 150-seat assembly, two deputies voted against the law and about a dozen did not vote. 

<p>Habre fled to Senegal after being deposed in 1990 and denies charges of killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents after coming to power in a bloody coup in 1982. The AU began talks with Senegal to come up with a plan for Habre's trial after the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icj-rules-senegal-must-try-or-extradite-former-chad-dictator-hissene-habre.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July that Senegal must either try Habre promptly or extradite him to Belgium for trial. The court's legally binding order also noted that Senegal had failed to make serious efforts to prosecute Habre, who has been been under house arrest there since 2005. In March lawyers for the Belgian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/belgium-urges-icj-to-order-senegal-to-prosecute-former-chad-dictator.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the ICJ to force Senegal to bring Habre to trial in Belgium. In July 2011 Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed its decision to deport Habre</a> [JURIST report] back to Chad after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/aboutus/pages/highcommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] warned of possible torture. That month Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued the plea</a> [JURIST report] to stay Habre's deportation to Chad after the nation's courts sentenced him to death in absentia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/madoff-brother-pleads-guilty-in-connection-with-ponzi-scheme.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges including conspiracy to commit securities fraud, tax fraud, mail fraud and falsifying records of an investment adviser. US Attorney Preet Bharara said:<blockquote>Peter Madoff was a gatekeeper, who was supposed to guard against fraud, but instead enabled it&#8212;facilitating his brother Bernie's breathtaking scheme by falsifying compliance records and lying to both regulators and clients of BLMIS. The decade he will spend in prison and the disgorgement of his assets are a just result. Our efforts to hold to account anyone and everyone who played a role in this unprecedented Ponzi scheme continue.</blockquote>Bernard Madoff was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> in June 2009 to 150 years in prison on <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">security fraud charges</a> [JURIST reports]. He had <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009 to all 11 charges against him.

<p>Last month Irwin Lipkin, a former controller of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/madoff-employee-pleads-guilty-to-falsifying-records.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to falsifying records. Lipkin faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, as well as criminal fines up to twice the gross gain or loss derived from the offenses. In June a New York judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/new-york-judge-approves-settlement-over-madoff-ponzi-scheme.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a $410 million settlement agreement between hedge fund manager Ezra Merkin and the state of New York in a lawsuit connected with the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. The case against Merkin was filed in 2009, accusing him of directing funds into Madoff's Ponzi scheme and charging him with violations of the Martin Act, General Business Law &#167; 352 and Executive Law &#167; 63(12). In March, Madoff trustee Irving Picard and the owners of the New York Mets <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/madoff-trustee-reaches-settlement-with-mets-owners.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] a $162 million settlement for victims of the Ponzi scheme to avoid a trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The update covers the period of September 28, when the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] passed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-body-extends-mission-of-independent-panel-in-syra.php">resolution extending</a> [JURIST report] the COI's mission, until December 16. According to the update:<blockquote>The unrelenting violence in Syria has resulted in thousands of deaths, untold thousands of wounded, detained and disappeared, and physical destruction on a massive scale. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes and those that remain struggle to secure basic necessities. World heritage sites have been damaged or destroyed, as have entire neighbourhoods. Civilians have borne the brunt of escalating armed confrontations as the front lines between Government forces and the armed opposition have moved deeper into urban areas. The patterns of international human rights and humanitarian law violations that were noted in previous reports have continued unabated, alongside a proliferation of both anti- and pro-Government armed entities.</blockquote>While the COI has still not been permitted to enter Syria, commissioners have interviewed more than 1,200 witnesses and victims. The COI will present its fourth report to the UN Human Rights Council in March.

<p>The Syrian government has been in conflict with the opposition since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence. Last week US President Barack Obama recognized the leading Syrian opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the country's people. A UN official said last month that a video posted on the Internet of Syrian rebels executing government soldiers who had surrendered may be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-syria-execution-video-may-be-war-crimes.php">evidence of war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In October UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] called on the international community to work to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">bring an end to the Syrian conflict</a> [JURIST report]. Her statement came after <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] reported earlier that month that the Syrian government was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/syria-military-using-banned-cluster-bombs-hrw.php">using cluster bombs</a> [JURIST report] against opposition forces. In September <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-investigators-human-rights-violations-in-syria-increasing.php">UN investigators reported</a> [JURIST report] that the number and frequency of human rights violations committed by both sides of the conflict were increasing rapidly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The split-decision upholds the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ontario-high-court-allows-witnesses-to-wear-niqab-unless-unfair-to-accused.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [official website]. The Supreme Court sought to strike a balance between an individual's right to freedom of religion with the right to a fair trial by permitting a jury to evaluate a witness' creditability under questioning. The court gave a variety of factors to be weighed by a trial judge:<blockquote>The judge should consider the importance of the religious practice to the witness, the degree of state interference with that practice, and the actual situation in the courtroom.  ...  The judge should also consider broader societal harms, such as discouraging niqab-wearing women from reporting offences and participating in the justice system, ... [and] the salutary effects of requiring the witness to remove the niqab.   ... When assessing potential harm to the accused's fair trial interest, the judge should consider whether the witness's evidence is peripheral or central to the case, the extent to which effective cross-examination and credibility assessment of the witness are central to the case, and the nature of the proceedings.  Where the liberty of the accused is at stake, the witness's evidence central and her credibility vital, the possibility of a wrongful conviction must weigh heavily in the balance.</blockquote>The trial began in 2007 after the woman told police that her uncle and cousin had repeatedly sexually assaulted her when she was between the ages of six and ten years old. The trial court required the victim to remove her veil when testifying against her uncle and cousin. 

<p>The wearing of traditional religious clothing in court rooms and other public places has been highly contested in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/georgia-woman-arrested-for-wearing-headscarf-in-court-files-lawsuit.php">United States</a> [JURIST report] and around the world. In September the <a href="http://www.parlament.ch/e/Pages/default.aspx">Swiss Parliament</a> [official website, in french] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/switzerland-lawmakers-reject-burqa-ban.php">voted against</a> [JURIST report] a bill which would ban <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=burqa">burqas</a> [JURIST news archive] and other face coverings in public places. In January the Netherlands announced that a ban on burqas would <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/netherlands-plans-to-ban-muslim-face-veils.php">go forward</a> [JURIST report] later this year. Proponents of the Netherlands ban said the purpose was to stop people from being able to commit crimes and remain undetected by concealing their identities and covering their faces. Belgium <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-officially-bans-burqa.php">officially banned</a> [JURIST report] burqas in July 2011. France's ban on burqas <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-burqa-ban-to-take-effect-april-11.php">took effect</a> [JURIST report] in April 2011. Some commentators have suggested that the rationales behind the European burqa bans are <a href="/forum/2012/02/maurits-berger-burqa-ban.php">weak</a> [JURIST op-ed] and that the true purpose of the bills is societal discomfort.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontwisconsinseal.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Wisconsin's 4th District Court of Appeals <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/ca/opinion/DisplayDocument.pdf?content=pdf&seqNo=90888">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that the state's domestic partnership registry does not infringe on the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Plaintiff <a href="http://www.wifamilyaction.org/">Wisconsin Family Action</a> [advocacy website] challenged the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0770.pdf">Domestic Partnership Registry</a> [Wisc. Stats. 770 text, PDF] as unconstitutional pursuant to the Marriage Amendment to Wisconsin's <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/wiscon">Constitution</a> [materials], which provides, "Only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state. A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized in this state." The appeals court rejected this claim, finding that the domestic partnership registry is not "substantially similar" to marriage:<blockquote>This case is not about whether the Wisconsin or United States Constitutions require, on equal protection or other grounds, that same-sex couples have the right to a legally recognized relationship that is identical or substantially similar to marriage. To the contrary, for the domestic partnership law to pass muster here, the "legal status" created by that law may not be "substantially similar" to the "legal status" of marriage. Because the legal and evidentiary arguments of the parties persuade us that the two are not "substantially similar," we affirm the circuit court's decision holding that the domestic partnership law does not violate the marriage amendment.</blockquote>The decision affirms a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-judge-upholds-domestic-partnership-registry.php">ruling by a lower court</a> [JURIST report] last year. The domestic partnership registry was defended by <a href="http://fairwisconsin.com/">Fair Wisconsin</a> [advocacy website] after <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> and <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official websites] refused to do so.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">Same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remains controversial throughout the US, with states taking various approaches. Earlier this week the <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/montana-high-court-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-suit.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court's dismissal of a lawsuit seeking legal status for same-sex relationships. Like Wisconsin, Montana also has a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Earlier this month Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/washington-governor-certifies-same-sex-marriage-referendum.php">certified the results of Referendum 74</a> [JURIST report] which legalized same-sex marriage in the state. Washington had previously <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/washington-governor-signs-domestic.php">recognized domestic partnerships</a> [JURIST report]. Also in December the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-to-review-constitutionality-of-same-sex-marriage.php">agreed to rule</a> [JURIST report] on two cases dealing with same-sex marriage. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-144.htm">Hollingsworth v. Perry</a> [docket] the court will consider the validity of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive], a California referendum that revoked same-sex marriage rights. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/12-307.htm">United States v. Windsor</a> [docket] the court will examine the constitutionality of Section 3 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/html/PLAW-104publ199.htm">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/Class_Action_Complaint_Final.pdf">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the <a href="http://www.doc.state.al.us/">Alabama Department of Corrections</a> (ADOC) [official website] last year challenging the policy. Judge Myron Thompson found Friday for the plaintiffs:<blockquote>the court finds that the segregation policy is based on outdated and unsupported assumptions about HIV and the prison system's ability to deal with HIV-positive prisoners. The policy is also infected, and the reasons the ADOC has proffered for its continued existence undermined, by an intentional bias against HIV-positive people, as reflected in a bias from those in charge ... and in a system-wide tolerance for a culture of bias, rooted in large measure in ignorance about HIV, from among not only prisoners but employees in general. ... Therefore, any remedy the defendants might propose to the court must be based not only on a willingness to revisit assumptions and to look to all reasonably available and untapped resources; and must not only be uninfected by bias against those with HIV, but it must also address the lack of education and ignorance among both prisoners and prison employees about HIV. "We live in Alabama" is not an excuse.</blockquote>Alabama was one of two states that still segregate prisoners based on HIV status&#8212;South Carolina is the other. <a href="http://picayuneitem.com/local/x1112099492/MDOC-to-end-segregation-of-HIV-inmates">Mississippi ended</a> [AP report] its segregation policy in 2009.

<p>In 2010 the ACLU and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] called on ADOC to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rights-groups-urge-alabama-to.php">end prison segregation based on HIV status</a> [JURIST report]. The ACLU and HRW jointly produced a <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Report Sentenced to Stigma Segregation of HIV-Positive Prisoners in Alabama and South Carolina.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], which concluded that the prisoners face fundamental discrimination which amounts to "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners," including "involuntary disclosure of HIV status to family, staff and other prisoners; loss of liberty by assignment to higher security prisons; denial of work, program and re-entry opportunities; and policies that promote, rather than combat, fear, prejudice and even violence against persons living with HIV." ADOC <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama Prison Commissioner Richard Allen%27s letter ACLU.pdf">responded</a> [report, PDF] by saying that the policy is necessary for the safety and protection of the inmates and guards and has resulted  in a "near zero" rate of new HIV infections within the Alabama prison system since 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Noor Khan, the plaintiff, lives in Miranshah, North Waziristan Agency of the <a href="http://fata.gov.pk/">Federally Administered Tribal Areas</a> (FATA) [official website] of Pakistan. Khan's father was killed in a March 2011 drone strike in North Waziristan that killed at least 44 people when it hit a community council meeting that intelligence services targeted as a meeting place for militants. In <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/pakistan-citizen-sues-uk-foreign-office-over-intelligence-sharing-for-us-drone-strikes.php">filing his lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], Khan sought information regarding the extent that the UK was aiding the US in drone efforts and for the court to evaluate if those strikes violate international war crimes laws. The court's decision was, in part, based on their reluctance to cast judgment upon the actions of the US:<blockquote>The principle that the courts will not sit in judgment on the sovereign acts of a foreign state includes a prohibition against adjudication upon the "legality, validity or acceptability of such acts, either under domestic law or international law." The rationale for this principle, is, in part, founded upon the proposition that the attitude and approach of one country to the acts and conduct of another is a matter of high policy, crucially connected to the conduct of the relations between the two sovereign powers. To examine and sit in judgment on the conduct of another state would imperil relations between the states.</blockquote>Khan said he <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/21/high-court-drone-strikes-pakistan">plans to appeal</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]

<p>Unmanned drone strikes have been a contentious legal issue, especially their use in Pakistan. In November, JURIST guest columnist <a href="http://www.nnklaw.com/attorney-profiles/samar-warsi">Samar Warsi</a> [professional profile] <a href="/hotline/2012/11/samar-warsi-drone-policy.php">argued</a> [JURIST comment] that drone attacks were counterproductive and hurt American attempts at foreign policy improvement. In August UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism Ben Emmerson said that the US government <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-expert-says-us-government-must-allow-investigation-of-drone-strikes.php">must allow an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the legality of its drone strike policy. In July the Pakistan Ambassador to the US called on the CIA to <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-calls-for-end-to-drone-strikes.php">stop using drone strikes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month US lawmakers expressed concern over the use of <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/pakistan-ambassador-to-us-calls-for-end-to-drone-strikes.php">drones within the US [JURIST report] at a hearing in the <a href="http://homeland.house.gov/">US House Committee on Homeland Security</a> [official website]. Also in July the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> [advocacy website] and the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/rights-groups-sue-over-deaths-from-cia-drone-strikes.php">filed a suit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the US government's targeted killing of three US citizens in drone strikes. Commentators have suggested that the CIA's claim that there have been zero civilian casualties due to drone strikes needs to be seriously examined [JURIST <a href="/forum/2011/08/laurie-blank-drone-strikes.php">op-ed</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court has referred the case to the <a href="http://europa.eu/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice/index_en.htm">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] for additional review. The Directive calls on telecommunications and Internet companies to retain data such as e-mails, text messages and cell phone records for use by law enforcement and government officials. The court expressed concern that this retention violates Article 8 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/CONVENTION_ENG_WEB.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].  Commentators have <a href="/forum/2012/04/ansgar-ohly-privacy-rights.php">discussed</a> the link between privacy and freedom of expression under the Convention, and <a href="/forum/2012/11/clark-asay-eu-privacy.php">noted</a> [JURIST op-eds] that EU privacy laws and regulations often have an impact on the US.

<p>Since its <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/eu-ministers-approve-data-retention.php">approval</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, the data retention law has been criticized by numerous countries. In May the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/eu-commission-refers-germany-to-eu-court-of-justice.php">referred</a> [JURIST report] Germany to the ECJ for not complying with the Directive. In March 2011 the Czech Republic's <a href="http://www.concourt.cz/view/internetcs">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Czech] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/czech-constitutional-court-overturns-parts-of-data-retention-law.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] parts of the law reasoning that it is unconstitutional. In February 2009, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-court-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to the data retention law. The court only addressed the issue of whether the law was valid in light of the ECT's trade provision and found that the law was valid because it standardized costs associated with retaining the data across the EU. Data retention policy has received attention in the US as well. In March US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-ag.html">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] signed new <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/holder-expands-use-of-data-in-terrorism-investigations.php">guidelines</a> [JURIST report] which permit the US government to gather data on American citizens to search for "terrorism information" which it can keep permanently. Commentators have <a href="/forum/2012/04/christopher-slobogin-privacy.php">warned</a> [JURIST op-ed] that these types of data retention policies can lead to the creation of "mass dossiers" that have significant privacy impacts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was brought by a non-profit organization known as <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/site/pp.asp?c=dkLNK1MQIwG&b=8281551">Common Cause</a> [advocacy website] as well as four members of the US House of Representatives and individuals who allege they would have benefited from the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=dream+act">DREAM Act</a> [JURIST news archive]. Despite acknowledging the filibuster rule as an important and controversial issue, the court ultimately denied further proceedings because of the plaintiffs' lack of standing and the court's overall apprehension toward interfering with separation of powers. While the US Constitution does not contain any language regarding the proper length of, or method for, the Senate to debate proposed legislation, it does grant each House the power to determine the rules of its proceedings, something "beyond the jurisdiction of this court," stated US District Judge Emmet Sullivan. 

<p>The Senate filibuster rule has been a long-standing tradition on Capitol Hill, but has not been without its criticism, particularly in the previous few years over alleged misuse and abuse. In May Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) on the Senate floor <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/11/harry-reid-filibuster-reform_n_1510167.html">called</a> [Huffington Post report] for a change to the rule, referencing bills for which both parties have shown overwhelming support, but are in danger of expiration due to unjustified filibuster delay. Currently, Senate rules dictate that 60 votes are needed to end debate on a bill while a simple majority would be required to pass it. The most infamous of filibusters was during debate over the <a href="/thisday/2010/08/civil-rights-act-of-1957-passed.php">Civil Rights Act of 1957</a> [JURIST report] in which former Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC) <a href="http://sti.clemson.edu/sti/general-info/biography-of-senator-strom-thurmond.html">spoke</a> [biography] on the Senate floor in protest of the bill for 24 hours and 18 minutes without pause, a record that stands to this day. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/rights-group-sues-costa-rica-for-failure-to-legalize-in-vitro-fertilization.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in July 2011 <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/demandas/12.361Eng.pdf">on behalf of</a> [text] 50 Costa Rican couples who have had to seek IVF procedures in other countries as a result of the ban. In 2000 the <a href="http://www.poder-judicial.go.cr/salaconstitucional/default.htm">Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica</a> [official website] banned IVF, declaring the practice unconstitutional because it violates an embryo's right to life. Since then, maintaining the ban has received <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/court-strikes-down-costa-rica-in-vitro-ban/story-fn3dxix6-1226542203418">support</a> [<em>The Australian</em> report] from conservative groups and the Catholic church in Costa Rica. Their campaigns focused on the disposal of fertilized eggs common in IVF procedures, portraying the practice as tantamount to murder. 

<p>IVF is a type of fertility treatment for couples who have had difficulty conceiving children. Through IVF, a woman's eggs are removed and fertilized outside the body. Successfully fertilized embryos are then implanted into the woman for gestation. Costa Rica was the only Western nation that banned the practice. Although the nation is known for a progressive human rights and civil liberties record, the government usually holds to the Catholic Church's edicts on many social issues. In August 2010 the Supreme Court of Costa Rica ruled 5-2 to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/costa-rica-high-court-removes-same-sex-civil-unions-from-ballot.php">disallow a nationwide referendum</a> [JURIST report] on whether to recognize <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=civil+unions+-ACLU+-EU+-American">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST backgrounder].

The injunction will prevent the law, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1172_bill_20120416_amended_sen_v97.html">SB 1172</a> [text], which was slated to take effect on January 1, 2013, from being enforced until the constitutionality of the law can be determined by the appeals court. The plaintiffs claim that the law violates their right to freedom of speech under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The plaintiffs were represented by the Christian legal group <a href="http://www.lc.org/">Liberty Counsel</a> (LC) [advocacy website], who were quick to declare the injunction a victory <a href="http://www.lc.org/index.cfm?PID=14100&PRID=1266">claiming</a> [press release] that the law is "politically motivated to interfere with counselors and clients." The court has indicated it will "fast-track" a review of the law which will allow for a speedier ruling on its constitutionality.

<p>Earlier in the month a federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-california-sexual-orientation-change-therapy-ban.php">refused to block the law</a> [JURIST report] claiming a challenge of the constitutionality was "not likely to prevail." A separate challenge to SB 1172 resulted in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-blocks-california-law-banning-sexual-orientation-change-therapy.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] by a different judge in the same court earlier in the week. That challenge, brought by the <a href="http://www.pacificjustice.org/">Pacific Justice institute</a> (PJI), resulted in a temporary injunction which would have allowed the plaintiffs in that case to continue SOCE after the law goes into effect. PJI filed its lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-sexual-orientation-therapy-ban-challenged.php">challenging</a> the bill just days after it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/california-becomes-first-state-to-pass-a-law-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">signed</a> [JURIST reports] into law by California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] in October. SB 1172 was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/california-lawmakers-approve-ban-therapy-to-reverse-homosexuality-for-minors.php">California State Assembly</a> [JURIST report] in August and the <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/california-senate-approves-bill-banning-sexual-orientation-therapy.php">California Senate</a> [JURIST report] in May. Supporters of the bill, including groups such as <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=5609559">Equality California</a> [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/pp.asp?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=5609559">American Psychoanalytic Association</a> [advocacy website] assert the reason for legislation is that homosexuality is not and should not be treated as a disease, and efforts to reverse homosexuality have proven to be detrimental to minors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The $7.8 billion settlement marks the final point in settling monetary remuneration between BP and those who suffered economic and property damages from the oil spill, but the settlement does not resolve claims by those who allege the oil spill has caused them illness. Judge Carl Barbier's ruling suggests that his ruling is both "favorable to claimants" while still putting an reasonable cap on the amount for which BP will be liable. The widely anticipated ruling was welcomed by lawyers on both sides of the claims. BP <a href="http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=2012968&contentId=7081710">welcomed the news</a> [press release] calling it an "important step forward for BP in meeting its commitment to economic and environmental restoration efforts in the Gulf."

<p>Friday's ruling has been another development in a long series of legal battles that have arisen from the Deepwater Horizon Crisis. Last month BP executives <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/bp-executive-supervisors-plead-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to criminal charges levied against them for their role in the spill. That same day the <a href="http://epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] announced that BP would be <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/2aaf1c1dc80c969885257abf006dafb0!OpenDocument">indefinitely suspended</a> [press release] from bidding on government contracts, saying the company's "lack of business integrity" has disqualified them from consideration. Also in November US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that BP had agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/holder-announces-record-45-billion-settlement-with-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">pay a record $4.5 billion in penalties and to plead guilty</a> [JURIST report] to felony misconduct for its role in the devastation caused by the oil spill. It has been argued that this settlement was a <a href="/hotline/2012/05/tim-mcevoy-bp-settlement.php">step in the right direction</a> [JURIST op-ed] for compensating those affected by the oil spill.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Google was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/italian-court-overturns-google-convictions-131500351--finance.html">"delighted"</a> [AP report] to see the convictions overturned and uncertainty over the effects of Italian privacy laws removed. The lower court's conviction raised concern over European privacy laws and the need to police the Internet for content that could be incompatible with the privacy laws. None of the Google executives was involved with the creation of the video, and the video was removed from the Internet two hours after authorities notified Google. In its final arguments, Google explained that the large quantity of videos and posts on the Internet would make it impossible for Google to preview everything prior to its posting. Google maintained that it was unaware of the offensive material posted online and proceeded to remove the video after being notified by authorities.

<p>In 2010 an Italian court found the three Google executives <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/italy-court-convicts-three-google.php">guilty of privacy violations</a> [JURIST report] for allowing a video depicting bullying to be posted on its website. The court in Milan found that the three men, David Carl Drummond, George De Los Reyes and Peter Fleitcher, violated the privacy rights of a young man with Down syndrome when they allowed a video showing his classmates bullying him to remain on the Google Italy website from September to November 2006. All three men were given a suspended sentence, though prosecutors had asked for a one-year imprisonment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://www.pcoo.gov.ph/archives2012/dec22.htm#Aquino_signs">Presidential Communications Operations Office</a> [press release], the Anti-Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance Act of 2012 criminalizes the "arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State." The law was passed by Congress in October. In a clause <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/21/philippines-milestone-law-criminalizes-forced-disappearances">deemed crucial</a> [HRW press release] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], those accused of violations of the law may not invoke "orders of battle-military documents that identify alleged enemies" in order to avoid prosecution under the law. In addition, the law gives subordinates the power to defy unlawful orders by superior officers commissioning enforced disappearances and holds superiors culpable for violations committed by by subordinates. Under the law, victims and kin of victims may seek compensation and restitution for violations by state agencies. Anyone convicted under the new law faces up to life in prison and may not receive amnesty. According to the Philippine Information Agency, the new law "mandates that Human Rights organizations shall participate in the crafting of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the law." 

<p>In March the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-rights-chief-decries-enforced-disappearance-as-one-of-the-worst-crimes.php">cited</a> [JURIST report] enforced disappearances as one of the most heinous crimes during her <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12014&LangID=E">opening statement</a> [text] to the Committee on Enforced Disappearances.The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disappearance-convention.htm">International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance</a> [text] was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/dozens-of-countries-sign-treaty-banning.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 by at least 57 countries, but has not been ratified by the required 20 to take effect. In August 2011 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-calls-for-end-to-enforced-disappearances.php">called for all states to end</a> [JURIST report] the "heinous crime" of enforced or involuntary disappearances. Enforced disappearances refers to the practice of placing people in secret detentions for weeks or months without ever being brought before a judge. Some victims of the practice say they were tortured during their detainment. According to HRW "Under [Philippine] President Ferdinand Marcos, enforced disappearances were rampant, as the military and police routinely rounded up activists and suspected communist rebels and supporters."   </p>]]></content:encoded>

The opposition has alleged the vote was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/12/20121223171356237726.html">marred by fraud</a> [Al Jazeera report] and irregularities, while the <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/">Muslim Brotherhood</a> [official website], the main supporters of the new constitution, claim the referendum has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/23/egypt-politics-approve-idUSL5E8NN06A20121223">passed with 64 percent "yes" votes</a> [Reuters report]. Official results have not been released yet and are expected on Monday. The National Salvation Front, the main opposition group, composed of united factions of liberals, socialists and others, had campaigned heavily for the rejection of the referendum. Members of the opposition have stated they will keep up pressure on Egyptian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">President Mohamed Morsi</a> [BBC backgrounder], including the continuation of peaceful protests. The opposition claims that the new constitution seeks to enshrine Islamic rule in Egypt, citing insufficient protection of women and minority groups, as well as empowering Muslim clerics by giving them say in the legislative process. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2012.09.20_-_draft_constitution_-_english.pdf">draft constitution</a> [text, PDF] is backed by the Islamists and has been extremely controversial. Earlier this month, a coalition of Egyptian rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-rights-groups-call-for-new-vote-on-constitution.php">called for a redo</a> [JURIST report] of the first round of the constitutional referendum <a href="http://www.cihrs.org/?p=5325&lang=en">alleging widespread irregularities</a> [press release], including lack of judicial supervision at the polling places and intentional delays at several women's polling places, rendering them unable to vote. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has also expressed concern at the rising death toll during the ongoing political chaos in Egypt, saying that Egypt's draft constitution <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-turmoil-in-egypt.php">presents serious problems for human rights</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">complained</a> [UN News Centre report] that the draft constitution was passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators. Pillay also said that she was concerned about the draft constitution's omission of references to international human rights treaties that Egypt ratified in the past. While Pillay commended the fact that the draft constitution imposes term limits on Morsi and provides some protections for freedom of expression and religion, she noted that these protections were not strong enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

LaPierre said that an assault weapons ban was a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/lawmakers-look-restrict-gun-magazine-capacity-082617451.html">"phony piece of legislation"</a> [AP report]. After LaPierre's interview on Sunday, it is very unlikely that the NRA will support any new regulations on guns. LaPierre reiterated the NRA's support for having an armed police officer at every school in the the country. Democrats in Congress have voiced their support for stricter gun control laws in the wake of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Democrats in Congress, led by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California are calling for a renewal on the expired ban on certain types of guns and on the number of bullets that a magazine can hold. Last week President Barack Obama called on Vice President Joe Biden to lead a task force to investigate and recommend policies to reduce gun violence in the US. 

<p>This story is the latest development in the Second Amendment and <a href="/hotline/2012/11/stephen-halbrook-nra-batfe.php">gun control debate</a> [JURIST commentary] in the US. In July Florida Governor Rick Scott announced that his state would <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/florida-to-appeal-federal-court-ruling-striking-down-state-gun-law.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] ruling that struck down a Florida law that barred doctors from discussing the dangers of gun ownership with patients. In July 2010 the Chicago City Council unanimously approved a new gun control law that bans gun shops in the city and prohibits gun owners from stepping outside their homes, including porches and garages, with a handgun. Shortly thereafter a group of Chicago citizens, supported by both the NRA and the National Association of Firearm Retailers, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/citizens-file-suit-against-chicago-gun-control-ordinance.php">filed suit against the city</a> [JURIST report] claiming the new ordinance infringes on their constitutional rights. In June 2010 the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-1521.ZO.html">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government, thereby overturning Chicago's ban on handguns and raising considerable uncertainty about what amount of regulations of firearms was permissible. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Although there is a <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/12/24/uk-venezuela-chavez-idUKBRE8BN0G220121224">constitutional mandate</a> [Reuters report] that the President be sworn in on January 10, Chavez is currently recovering in Cuba from an operation which took place after his re-election in October. The recent surgery for Chavez's cancer has raised doubts over whether the Venezuela President is fit to govern for another term. Opposition leaders have demanded that there be new elections due to Chavez's critical health condition and the importance of the swearing in date. A constitutional dispute over the delayed swearing in of President Chavez could lead to a turbulent transition in Venezuela and effect the South America region. Chavez supporters are trying to avoid a public debate over the Venezuelan President's health, keeping details about his condition and treatment secret. 

<p>Chavez has been a controversial figure in the region. In July, Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/venezuela-withdraws-from-human-rights-court.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the country would withdraw from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR). In a statement during a military ceremony, Chavez announced the withdrawal and criticized the regional court, saying it is not fit to be called a human rights court. The decision came just after the IACHR concluded that the prison conditions of a man convicted in multiple bombings were a violation of his human rights. In 2011, Chavez <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/venezuela-president-criticizes-human-rights-court-ruling.php">criticized the IACHR</a> [JURIST report] for ruling in favor of presidential hopeful Leopoldo Lopez, allowing him to run for office despite a separate court ruling barring him from the election. In October 2011, the Supreme Court of Venezuela <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/venezuela-high-court-rules-opposition-candidate-ineligible-to-run-for-president.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that presidential hopeful Leopoldo Lopez remained banned from running in next year's elections. Lopez, an opposition leader, was considered to be a threat to Chavez. As a result of corruption allegations, he was banned from public office through 2014 by the country's comptroller general.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Singh <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/delhi-gang-rape-public-anger-genuine-says-pm-appeals-for-peace-308963?h_related_also_see">reiterated</a> [New Delhi Television report] the government's commitment to providing security to women, but stated that violent clashes with police amid protests was not the answer. Some additional protest resulted when Singh asked <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/online-fury-as-pm-is-heard-asking-theek-hai-at-end-of-speech-309153?pfrom=home-lateststories">"theek hai (alright?)"</a> [New Delhi Television report] after his speech. This heightened atmosphere is the result of the <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/1244207/1/.html">gang rape last Sunday</a> [AFP report] of a student in New Delhi. Six men have since been arrested and each man is presented with a life sentence if it is determined that he played any role in the savage attack.  

<p>India has recently dealt with some controversial sexual rights and rape issues. In February, the Indian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/india-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-legality-of-homosexuality.php">heard additional arguments</a> [JURIST report] challenging the decriminalization of homosexual intercourse. In 2009, the Delhi High Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/india-court-declares-anti-sodomy-law.php">decriminalized homosexual conduct</a>  [JURIST report] by declaring India's anti-sodomy law unconstitutional. In 2008, the UN found significant evidence that <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/india-peacekeeping-troops-accused-of.php">Indian peacekeeping troops committed sex-crimes</a> [JURIST report] while stations with the UN Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

These <a href=" http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/24/gaza-palestinian-rockets-unlawfully-targeted-israeli-civilians">laws of war</a> [HRW report] prohibit focused attacks on civilians and civilian structures or attacks that distinguish between civilians and military targets. "There is simply no legal justification for launching rockets at populated areas," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. Palestinian armed units have claimed that last November's <a href=" http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20394242">Israeli attacks in Gaza</a> [BBC report] provoked the firing of rockets into Israel and should excuse the Palestinian units from their acts. The rocket attacks which first launched from the Gaza Strip left three Israelis dead and at least 38 wounded. HRW urged <a href=" http://www.hamasinfo.net/ar/#&slider1=1">Hamas</a> [official website, in Arabic] the source of authority in Gaza to enforce the appropriate laws and punish the offenders.

<p>Tension has recently increased between Israel and Palestine. Earlier this month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/hrw-accuses-israel-of-war-crimes.php">accused Israel of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] after the November attacks in Gaza. Also this month, the Israel government <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/israel-rejects-palestinian-authority-statehood-despite-un-resolution.php">rejected the UN General Assembly resolution</a> [JURIST report] to upgrade Palestine's UN status to non-member observer state. Last June, the United Nations <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/un-expert-concerned-over-free-speech-in-israel-palestine.php">addressed the limits on free speech</a> [JURIST report] in Israel and Palestine due to the heightened political intensity in both countries. In May, an Israel military court <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/israel-military-court-sentences-palestine-protest-leader-to-13-months.php">sentenced a Palestinian protest leader</a> [JURIST report] to 13 months imprisonment for encouraging youth to throw rocks at Israeli soldiers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Planned Parenthood filed a preliminary injunction after the <a href="http://www.ok.gov/health/">Oklahoma State Department of Health</a> [official website] notified the organization that it would be <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PLANNED_PARENTHOOD_LAWSUIT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">ending its contract with the organization</a> [AP report]. At issue is the <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/">Women, Infants and Children</a> (WIC) [official website] program which provides federal grants to states for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low income pregnant women. Planned Parenthood had participated in the Oklahoma WIC for 18 years. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's President and CEO Jill June released a <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/local-press-releases/court-denies-prelimiary-injunction-40732.htm">statement</a> [press release] expressing her disappointment with the decision and explaining that they will be forced to end WIC services on December 31, which may ultimately result in the closing of its health center in West Tulsa. Planned Parenthood alleges that the state decided to terminate the contract because the organization offers abortion services.

<p>Monday's decision is merely the latest in a number of controversies regarding <a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">reproductive rights</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in Oklahoma. Earlier this month, the Oklahoma Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/oklahoma-high-court-strikes-down-state-abortion-laws.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that two state laws limiting abortion rights unconstitutionally interfered with patients' and physicians' rights to make decisions regarding medical treatment. In October 2011, an Oklahoma law restricting the use of abortion inducing drugs was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/oklahoma-judge-blocks-new-law-restricting-use-of-abortion-pills.php">temporarily blocked </a> [JURIST report] by a state court. In April 2011, Oklahoma's governor <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law which restricts abortions after 20 weeks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lukin <a href="http://en.ria.ru/business/20121225/178393350.html">filed the appeal</a> [RIA Novosti report] because the two men were ordered to pay restitution for the same losses twice, once in 2005 and once in 2010. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are serving prison sentences for fraud, theft and money laundering. Khodorkovsky maintains his innocence and alleges that the charges are retribution for funding opposition parties during the presidency of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15047823">Vladimir Putin</a> [BBC profile]. 

<p>Earlier this month, Khodorkovsky and Lebedev had their <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-court-reduces-khodorkovsky-sentence.php">sentences commuted</a> [JURIST report] by the Moscow City Court from 13 years to 11 years, making both men eligible for release in 2014.

Opposition leaders and other groups have expressed skepticism concerning the validity of the conviction and many believe it was politically motivated. In 2010, former Russian Prime Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7202708.stm">Mikhail Kasyanov</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">testified</a> [JURIST report] before the Khamovnichesky District Court and stated that Khodorkovsky's arrest was ordered by Vladimir Putin for political reasons. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The General Assembly adopted an arms treaty with 133 votes in favor of the updated text, no votes against it, and 17 abstentions. This vote was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/25/us-arms-treaty-un-idUSBRE8BO00B20121225">opposed</a> [Reuters report] by the <a href="http://home.nra.org/#/nraorg">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) [advocacy website], who lobbied against the UN's vote. Negotiations over an international arms treaty which broke down in July, will now resume. UN delegates said that the talks originally fell apart due to the political climate in the US with President Barack Obama fearing that an international treaty for the sale of arms would be politically damaging in the wake of the presidential election. The Obama Administration has now come out in support of an international arms treaty. Meanwhile, the NRA opposes any type of international arms treaty and has put pressure on President Obama to oppose treaty negotiations for the global sale of arms. As part of the vote, the General Assembly agreed to convene in New York from March 10 through March 28, 2013.

<p>The UN's vote comes just a day after the NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/nra-ceo-dismisses-renewal-of-ban-on-assault-weapons.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] called for a renewed ban on assault weapons on Sunday. LaPierre said that an assault weapons ban was a "phony piece of legislation." After LaPierre's interview on Sunday, it is very unlikely that the NRA will support any new regulations on guns. LaPierre reiterated the NRA's support for having an armed police officer at every school in the the country. In August UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/un-sg-urges-international-effort-to-combat-illegal-weapons-trade.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the international community to prevent the illegal trade of weapons, which are responsible for killing more than 500,000 people every year. The Program of Action adopted by various countries in 2001 lists recommendations for countries to bolster national legislation combating the illegal trade of weapons and improve regional and international cooperation to assist in this effort. <br />

The prosecution is <a href="http://en.trend.az/regions/scaucasus/georgia/2102916.html">investigating</a> [Trend report] allegations of torture in the prison. The prosecution explained that it was examining photographs of prisoners inside the Tbilisi prison which were released.

The law in question was <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/Display/20112012/HB/954">Georgia House Bill 954</a>, which would have modified <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-12/article-5/16-12-141/">OCGA 16-12-141</a> [texts] with the changes to become effective January 1, 2013. The enjoined provisions include the prohibition of previability abortion care and the requirement for hospitals or health facilities to provide records to the local district attorney without a warrant. A suit was <a href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom-womens-rights/lathrop-et-al-v-deal-et-al">filed</a> [press release; <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/georgia-aclu-branch-files-suit-to-block-state-abortion-law.php">JURIST report</a>] earlier in December by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/affiliate/georgia">American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia</a> (ACLU) [official website] on behalf of three Georgia obstetrician-gynecologists whose patients include women in need of abortions.

<p>Numerous states have changed their abortion laws to restrict the availability of abortion recently, usually leading to legal challenges. Last month, Montana voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/montana-approves-parental-notification-abortion-law.php">passed a referendum</a> [JURIST report] requiring facilities and doctors to inform parents of minors 16 to 48 hours before a planned abortion procedure. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-arizona-20-week-abortion-ban.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on a challenge to Arizona's law which, like Georgia's law, bans abortions after 20 weeks. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-regarding-low-income-health-program.php">sued Texas</a> [JURIST report] in October claiming that its law preventing state funding from going to any clinics affiliated with providing abortions violates another state law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, only 32.9% of Egypt's total of 52 million voters actually participated in the referendum, leading many to debate its results. Egyptian press and commentators are <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20843535">divided over the approval</a> [BBC report] of the new constitution, with some declaring the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20842750">results to be "fake"</a> [BBC report], and supporters from the Muslim Brotherhood claiming it to be the valid choice of the people. Immediately after the referendum, a coalition of Egyptian rights group called for a redo of the referendum, alleging <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-rights-groups-call-for-new-vote-on-constitution.php">widespread irregularities</A> [JURIST report]. 

<p>The final draft of the constitution is backed by the Islamists and has been extremely controversial. Earlier in December, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on discrimination against women</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-womens-rights-experts-concerned-over-egypt-draft-constitution.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] over the draft constitution. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has also expressed concern at the rising death toll during the ongoing political chaos in Egypt, saying that Egypt's draft constitution <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-turmoil-in-egypt.php">presents serious problems for human rights</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">complained</a> [UN News Centre report] that the draft constitution was passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators. Pillay also said that she was concerned about the draft constitution's omission of references to international human rights treaties that Egypt ratified in the past. While Pillay commended the fact that the draft constitution imposes term limits on President Mohammed Morsi and provides some protections for freedom of expression and religion, she noted that these protections were not strong enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two other in the killing had their sentences reduced to 15 years in prison. The court also cut life sentences issued to 13 men for killing a Pakistan citizen during the protests to 15 years in prison. Additionally the court reduced the sentences of 15 people jailed for the protest inspired attempted murder of a Bahraini soldier. Bahrain has been besieged by civil unrest since Shiite groups staged uprisings in February 2011 demanding democratic reform of the Bahrain's Sunni-led monarchy. Thousands of protesters were subsequently arrested and faced strict prison sentences.  After facing scrutiny by human rights group, Bahrain has taken steps to address the brutality of its security forces.

Sotomayor ruled that the Oklahoma City family's religiously oriented business <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/12/contraceptives-mandate-left-intact-for-now/#more-156985">did not meet the requirements to continue the injunction</a> [SCOTUSblog report] against the PPACA's mandate. The opinion stated that the Hobby Lobby family did not meet the standard of showing that they have an "indisputably clear" legal right to an injunction while appeal is pending. Justice Sotomayor stated: <blockquote>While the applicants allege they will face irreparable harm if they are forced to choose between complying with the contraception-coverage requirement and paying significant fines, they cannot show that an injunction is necessary or appropriate to aid our jurisdiction. Even without an injunction pending appeal, the applicants may continue their challenge to the regulations in the lower courts. Following a final judgment, they may, if necessary, file a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court.</blockquote> Justice Sotomayor's opinion was limited to whether the injunction should stand and did not address whether the constitutional challenge would succeed. 

<p>This is the first time that the Supreme Court has been involved in the legal battles over the contraceptives mandate in the PPACA, but more than forty lawsuits have been filed challenging the provision. Sotomayor's opinion, however, is just the latest development in the legal battle over the PPACA. Last week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-blocks-missouri-birth-control-coverage-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a Missouri law which prohibits mandatory insurance coverage of birth control for any employers with ethical or religious objections, finding that the state law conflicts with the PPACA. The <a href="http://www.moinsurancecoalition.com/">Missouri Insurance Coalition</a> [official website] sought to have the state law blocked, arguing that it is invalid because it conflicts with federal law. Earlier this month, attorneys for the federal government filed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-court-urged-to-dismiss-oklahoma-challenge-to-health-care-law.php">motion</a> [JURIST report] with the US District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to dismiss a complaint challenging the PPACA. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt had filed a suit in January against the federal health care law arguing that "Congress had exceeded its Article I powers by enacting the Act's minimum coverage provision. Last month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-orders-rehearing-in-health-care-case.php">remanded</a> <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">Liberty University v. Geithner</a> [JURIST reports] to the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website]. The court ordered the lower court to re-consider the case in light of <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [JURIST report], in which the Supreme Court decided in June that the PPACA is a constitutionally valid exercise of Congress's powers under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag26_user.html">Taxing Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.syriahr.com/">Syrian Observatory for Human Rights</a> [official website, Arabic] also <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/12/20121226102221539127.html">reported</a> [Al Jazeera report] that many other civilians were injured in the government's attack. The video posted online displayed several dead bodies on blankets outside of houses, including one child. There has been an escalation of violence in Raqqa as the opposition seeks to oust the current regime from the province bordering Turkey. The UN and Russia have renewed calls for a <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_SYRIA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">peace initiative</a> [AP report] that was <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/un-backed-action-group-makes-agreement-on-steps-for-peaceful-transition-in-syria.php">originally proposed</a> [JURIST report] in June at an international conference in Geneva. The plan called for a cease-fire, a transition government to take power until the country's elections, and a new constitution. The plan was initially rejected by both political parties in Syria. The opposition was opposed to this plan because the plan did not explicitly ban <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=president+bashar+assad">President Bashar Assad</a> [JURIST news archives] from participating in the transition government. The regime in power rejected the plan because it would involve them giving up power. 

<p>The Syrian government has been in conflict with the opposition since 2011, and the international community has become increasingly concerned about the violence. Last week the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/menaregion/pages/syindex.aspx">UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry</a> (COI) [official website] in Syria released its latest <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/syria-rights-violations-persist-un-update.php">periodic update</a> [JURIST report], finding persistent violence and human rights abuses. The update covered the period of September 28, when the UN Human Rights Council passed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-rights-body-extends-mission-of-independent-panel-in-syra.php">resolution extending</a> [JURIST report] the COI's mission, until December 16. Earlier this month US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=barack+obama">President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST news archives] recognized the leading Syrian opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the country's people. A UN official said last month that a video posted on the Internet of Syrian rebels executing government soldiers who had surrendered may be <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/un-syria-execution-video-may-be-war-crimes.php">evidence of war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. In October, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] called on the international community to work to <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/un-rights-chief-urges-world-powers-to-help-end-syria-uprisings.php">bring an end to the Syrian conflict</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Website editor Raif Badawi, 30, was originally charged with &#8220;insulting Islam through electronic channels&#8221; for co-founding the religious discussion website Free Saudi Liberals, but he now <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/22/saudi-arabia-website-editor-facing-death-penalty">faces the death penalty for renouncing Islam</a> [HRW report]. After presiding over five sessions of the trial at the Jeddah District Court, Judge Abdulrahim al-Muhaydeef was replaced without explanation by Judge Muhammad al-Marsoom, who referred the case to the Public Court of Jeddah on December 17 with a recommendation to try Badawi for apostasy. Shariah-based Saudi law is not codified and judges do not follow a system of precedent, but apostasy is a capital offense punishable by death. HRW claims that Badawi's arrest violates his right to freedom of expression. Badawi was detained by security forces in June. The website was originally founded in 2008 and included articles that were critical of senior religious figures, and has since been removed.

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for conducting unfair trials against opposition leaders and human rights activists. In August, several international human rights groups, including HRW, sent a letter to the Saudi <a href="http://www.moj.gov.sa/ar-sa/Pages/Default.aspx">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website, in Arabic] seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/rights-groups-ask-saudi-arabia-to-make-trials-against-activists-public.php">observe the trials of four rights activists</A> [JURIST report]. Saudi lawyer Walid Abu al-Khair and writer Mikhlif al-Shammari, and professors and human rights advocates Abdullah al-Hamid and Mohammad al-Qahtani face charges of defaming the country's reputation, supporting international human rights groups and sparking demonstrations against the government. In July, HRW first <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/16/saudi-arabia-free-editor-held-under-cybercrime-law">urged Saudi authorities to release Badawi</a> [HRW report] soon after he was charged with infringing on religious values under the Saudi 2007 Anti-Cybercrime law. In January, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] reported on the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-criticizes-increased-use-of-capital-punishment-in-saudi-arabia.php">increased use of capital punishment in Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST report] and increased use of torture to obtain confessions. Additionally, HRW revealed that the number of capital punishment cases in the country has nearly tripled since 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-upper-house-of-parliament-backs-ban-on-us-adoptions.php">unanimously passed this week</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href=" http://www.council.gov.ru/eng/index.html">Council of Federation</a> [official website], the upper house of the Russian parliament, after passing the lower house by a vote of 420 to 7. The bill is widely viewed as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-set-to-ban-us-adoptions/2012/12/27/fd49c542-504f-11e2-8b49-64675006147f_story.html">retaliation against US legislation</a> [WP report] aimed at corrupt Russian officials and signed into law earlier this month. In response to the Russian bill's passage the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children&#8217;s Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] urged the Russian government to <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_66995.html">act only in the best interest of the children</a> [press release] affected by such a measure:<blockquote>We encourage the government to establish a robust national social protection plan to help strengthen Russian families. Alternatives to the institutionalization of children are essential, including permanent foster care, domestic adoption and inter-country adoption ... All children deserve an environment that promotes their protection and well-being. Russian children&#8212;indeed all children&#8212;need to be in protective and loving families or family-like environments.</blockquote>The Russian adoption law is known as the Yakovlev initiative, after US-adopted Russian toddler Dima Yakolev, who died in Virginia in 2008. It will still allow Russian children to be taken to the US by relatives.

<p>The <a href="http://rapsinews.com/">Russian Legal Information Agency</a> (RAPSI) [official website], a legal information agency which operates in coordination with Russian courts, reports the Yakovlev initiative was <a href="http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20121221/265867961.html">adopted in retaliation</a> [RAPSI report] against the US <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1039/text">Magnitsky Act</a> [text].

The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/russia-upper-house-of-parliament-backs-ban-on-us-adoptions.php">unanimously passed this week</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href=" http://www.council.gov.ru/eng/index.html">Council of Federation</a> [official website], the upper house of the Russian parliament, after passing the lower house by a vote of 420 to 7. Putin <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/putin-announces-intent-to-sign-russia-adoption-law.php"> signaled his intent</a> [JURIST report] to sign the bill yesterday. The bill is widely viewed as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-set-to-ban-us-adoptions/2012/12/27/fd49c542-504f-11e2-8b49-64675006147f_story.html">retaliation against US legislation</a> [WP report] aimed at corrupt Russian officials and signed into law earlier this month. The Russian adoption law is known as the Yakovlev initiative, after US-adopted Russian toddler Dima Yakolev, who died in Virginia in 2008. The US State Department released a <a href = "http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/12/202401.htm">statement</a> [text] denouncing the law.<blockquote>The Russian government&#8217;s politically motivated decision will reduce adoption possibilities for children who are now under institutional care. We regret that the Russian government has taken this step rather than seek to implement the bilateral adoption agreement that entered into force in November. We are further concerned about statements that adoptions already underway may be stopped and hope that the Russian government would allow those children who have already met and bonded with their future parents to finish the necessary legal procedures so that they can join their families.</blockquote>The law will come into force on <a href = "http://interfax.ru/politics/txt.asp?id=283305">January 1</a> [Interfax report, in Russian], ending any adoptions by US parents that have not concluded by that date. <a href = "http://www.anticorruption.bg/ombudsman/eng/readnews.php?id=6081&lang=en&t_style=tex&l_style=default">Human Rights Commissioner</a> of Russia <a href = "http://www.eng.yabloko.ru/People/Luk/lukin1.html">Vladimir Lukin</a> [official profiles] suggested he may challenge the law in the constitutional court.

<p>The <a href="http://rapsinews.com/">Russian Legal Information Agency</a> (RAPSI) [official website], a legal information agency which operates in coordination with Russian courts, reports the Yakovlev initiative was <a href="http://rapsinews.com/judicial_news/20121221/265867961.html">adopted in retaliation</a> [RAPSI report] against the US <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1039/text">Magnitsky Act</a> [text]. The new US legislation places financial and visa sanctions on officials connected to the arrest, imprisonment and death of <a href=" http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8367143.stm">Sergei Magnitsky</a> [BBC report], a lawyer and whistleblower who unearthed a US$230 million tax fraud, and was subsequently arrested by the police officers he accused of carrying out the fraud.

In the first case, the Court of Appeals of Cambodia upheld a lower court's 20-year sentence against two individuals, Born Samnang and Sok Sam Oeun, for the 2004 murder of Chea Vichea, the leader of Free Trade Union (FTU). HRW criticized the recent holding because it has been clear throughout the criminal proceedings that there were insufficient evidence for a conviction and that the individuals were used as scapegoats. The two individuals had been arrested and convicted for 20 years but the Supreme Court remanded the case for further investigation and released the individuals on bail in 2009. However, in the recent ruling, the Court of Appeals made no mentioning of new evidence being admitted. The second case involved a leader of a movement protesting mass evictions from Phnom Penh's Boeng Kak area. Yorm Bopha, her husband and her two brothers were convicted for assaulting a man who had stolen her car's side mirrors. The trial against the four individuals has been based on fabricated evidence. Rupert Abbott, Researcher on Cambodia for <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] condemned the ruling stating that "[t]hese shocking verdicts show why Cambodians have good reason not to trust their courts." AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/convictions-activists-cambodia-demonstrates-dire-state-justice-2012-12-27">designated</a> [press release] Bopha, who was sentenced to three years in prison, as prisoner of conscience and accused the country of not respecting the rule of law.

<p>In October a Cambodian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/cambodia-court-sentences-rights-activist-to-20-years-in-prison.php">sentenced a prominent Cambodian radio broadcaster</a> [JURIST report] and rights activist to 20 years imprisonment for inciting rebellion against the state. He was arrested in July on accusations of being involved in a plot to incite villagers in eastern Kratie to rebel against the Cambodian government in an effort to establish an autonomous region in the province. A month earlier, the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] released the former "First Lady" of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khmer+Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> [JURIST news archive] regime, Ieng Thirith. The court ruled that she should be released due her degenerative illness, said to likely be Alzheimer's. Thirith, the sister-in-law of former leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/pot_pol.shtml">Pol Pot</a> [BBC backgrounder], has always denied any wrongdoing. The ECCC has only convicted one former Khmer Rouge leader, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier in September the ECCC announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/eccc-announces-declassification-of-documents-related-to-war-crimes-trial.php">declassify more than 1,700 war crimes documents</a> [JURIST report] in efforts toward more convictions. Ieng Thirith was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cambodia-genocide-court-indicts-4-ex-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in September 2010 along with Ieng Sary, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea. The ECCC ruled in November that Ieng Thirith was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/with-only-a-few-days.php">unfit to stand trial</a>, but the Supreme Court Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-blocks-release-of-khmer-rouge-leader.php">ordered that she remain in detention</a> [JURIST reports] and that the Trial Chamber exhaust all measures so that she can stand trial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The investigations are against <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10420218">Mohammed El-Baradei</a>, a Nobel Peace laureate and former head of the UN nuclear agency, former Foreign Minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17234124">Amr Mousa</a> [BBC profiles] and <a href="http://blogs.aljazeera.com/blog/middle-east/egypts-surprise-candidate-hamdeen-sabahi">Hamdeen Sabahi</a> [Aljazeera profile]. The accusations <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/12/2012122842320389703.html">were filed</a> [Aljazeera report] earlier this month by two lawyers and the order to investigate came a day after Morsi <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/egypt-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">signed </a> [JURIST report] into law the country's <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/final_constitution_30_nov_2012_-english-_-idea.pdf">new constitution</a> [text, PDF]. The three individuals had created a coalition, the National Salvation Front, in an effort to protest against Morsi. Mousa and Sabahi were presidential candidates in the recent presidential election. Critics have condemned the recent investigative order, accusing Morsi of taking measures similar to ousted president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18371427">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>] against his opponents. According to them, the order is merely an attempt to silence opposition against his regime. The new constitution that was signed on Wednesday was supported by over 63 percent of those who voted in the referendum but only 32.9% of Egypt's total of 52 million voters actually participated in the referendum.

<p>Egypt is still attempting to reconcile the political crash arising out of the <a href="/feature/featured/egyptian-revolution/">Egyptian revolution</a> [JURIST backgrounder] last year, particularly regarding the constitution. The final draft of the constitution is backed by the Islamists and has been extremely controversial. Earlier in this month, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/WGWomen/Pages/WGWomenIndex.aspx">UN Working Group on discrimination against women</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-womens-rights-experts-concerned-over-egypt-draft-constitution.php">expressed grave concern</a> [JURIST report] over the draft constitution. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has also expressed concern at the rising death toll during the ongoing political chaos in Egypt, saying that Egypt's draft constitution <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/un-rights-chief-expresses-concern-over-turmoil-in-egypt.php">presents serious problems for human rights</a> [JURIST report]. Pillay <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true&LangID=E">complained</a> [UN News Centre report] that the draft constitution was passed without the participation of Christian or liberal legislators. Pillay also said that she was concerned about the draft constitution's omission of references to international human rights treaties that Egypt ratified in the past. While Pillay commended the fact that the draft constitution imposes term limits on President Mohammed Morsi and provides some protections for freedom of expression and religion, she noted that these protections were not strong enough.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two businesses, a craft store and religious bookstore, are owned by a Christian family, and are represented by the <a href = "http://www.becketfund.org">Becket Fund for Religious Liberty</a> [advocacy website]. Their attorney, Kyle Duncan, posted this <a href = "http://www.becketfund.org/statement-regarding-sotomayor-opinion/">statement</a> [text] in response to Sotomayor's order.<blockquote>Hobby Lobby will continue their appeal before the Tenth Circuit. The Supreme Court merely decided not to get involved in the case at this time. It left open the possibility of review after their appeal is completed in the Tenth Circuit. The company will continue to provide health insurance to all qualified employees. To remain true to their faith, it is not their intention, as a company, to pay for abortion-inducing drugs.</blockquote>Duncan later <a href = "http://newsok.com/article/3741128">clarified to the press</a> [NewsOK report] that the companies would not be complying with the mandate where contraception is concerned, despite Sotomayor declining to enjoin the mandate. Defying the mandate, which goes into effect for the businesses on Tuesday, could result in <A href = "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/12/28/Hobby-Lobby-to-defy-Supreme-Court/UPI-16871356724305/">fines of $1.3 million per day of violation</a> [UPI report].

<p>US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Wednesday <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Hobby-Lobby-opinioin-12-26-12.pdf">denied</a> [opinion, PDF] the Green family's application for injunction which would have prevented enforcement of the provision in the PPACA pending its appeal to the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] challenging the provision. Sotomayor ruled that the Oklahoma City family's religiously oriented business did not meet the requirements to allow an injunction against the PPACA's mandate. The opinion stated that the Hobby Lobby family did not meet the standard of showing that they have an "indisputably clear" legal right to an injunction while appeal is pending. The organizations are appealing an order by the US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma that <a href = "http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Order-for-HL-PI.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that despite the family's religious values, the businesses do not qualify for an injunction. "However, Hobby Lobby and Mardel are not religious organizations. Plaintiffs have not cited, and the court has not found, any case concluding that secular, for-profit corporations such as Hobby Lobby and Mardel have a constitutional right to the free exercise of religion."</p>]]></content:encoded>

After the SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-221.htm">charged</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/hedge-fund-founder-denies-insider.php">report</a>] Rajaratnam with insider trading in 2009, the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] him in May of 2011 of five counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and nine counts of securities fraud. In October 2011 he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 11 years in prison, fined for $10 million and ordered to forfeit an additional $53.8 million to the SEC. While Rajaratnam is in the process of appealing criminal convictions as he serves his sentence, his agreement to settle the concurrent civil suit with the SEC effectively <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/27/us-rajaratnam-seclawsuit-idUSBRE8BQ01B20121227">abrogates any right of appeal</a> [Reuters report] and payment must be remitted within a 90 day period. The sum is meant to represent profits gained unfairly from insider trading tips garnered from former <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> [official website] director <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rajat+Gupta">Rajat Gupta</a> [JURIST news archive], who was also <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted of fraud</a> [JURIST report] in June.  

<p>Raj Rajaratnam's case has been called the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history, and his sentence is the longest term ever imposed for insider trading. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-begins-11-year-sentence.php">11-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] was significantly lower than the 24 1/2-year sentence requested by prosecutors and less than the 19 1/2-year minimum indicated by the non-obligatory federal sentencing guidelines. Calling his crime an assault on free markets and a virus in business culture in need of eradication, Judge Richard Holwell cited Rajaratnam's charitable financial help for victims of the tsunami in Sri Lanka, the earthquakes in Pakistan and the 9/11 attacks, as well as his impeding kidney failure due to advanced Type II diabetes as reasons for the comparatively lenient sentence. Several other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. Danielle Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January 2011. Former IBM senior vice president Robert Moffat was sentenced to six months in prison in September 2011 and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty </a>[JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former Intel Capital executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-intel-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty </a>[JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and charged along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While the law <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-20860264">mandates</a> [BBC report] that adult children must visit and assist elderly parents on a regular basis, it provides no express provisions for the frequency or nature of such visits. The law comes in the wake of a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-19572056">paradigm shift in Chinese demographics</a> [BBC report], where life expectancy has increased from 43 to 73 in the past five decades. Experts have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19630110">stated</a> [BBC report] that by 2050 more than a quarter of the Chinese population, already tallied at over 1.34 billion, will be over 65 and care must be shifted to younger generations. In addition, Chinese newspapers are allegedly replete with reports of abuse, neglect and abandonment of elderly parents by adult children. The law seeks to remedy the situation while providing elderly parents with a means of protecting their assets and property from children that seek to take advantage of their elderly state. 

<p>China has passed several other measures in response to social issues and demographic shifts. In October, the NPC <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/china-adopts-first-mental-health-law.php">adopted</a> [JURIST] the nation's first mental health law to protect the rights of the mentally ill, according to a report by the country's state-run news agency. The new law was designed to protect the safety and privacy of individuals with mental illnesses and specifically targeted protection of the identities and personal information of individuals receiving care in psychiatric facilities. In April 2009 the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/china-issues-first-human-rights.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] its first national plan aimed at protecting human rights. The plan set forth measures to protect people's rights to education, employment, medical and old-age care, and housing, and also sought to protect ethnic minorities, promote gender equality, guarantee suspects the right to an impartial trial, and prohibit illegal detentions and the use of torture to extract confessions from suspects. In addition China also sought to provide basic nationwide health care, slow its greenhouse-gas emissions, and protect normal religious activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://bj2zy.chinacourt.org">Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court</a> [official website, in Chinese], a regional court directly below China's appellate level courts, <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/business/2012-12/27/c_132067518.htm">held</a> [Xinhau News report] that software available on Apple's app store contained unlicensed digital copies of the writers' books in violation of the plaintiffs' "right of communication through information networks." The <a href="http://www.prccopyright.org.cn/">China Written Works Copyright Society</a> (CWWCS) [official website, in Chinese], an organization representing the writers in the complaint, originally asked for $1.89 million in compensatory damages and <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/23/chinese_writers_double_request_for_damages_in_apple_piracy_suit">nearly doubled</a> [<em>Apple Insider</em> report] that request in February to $3.65 million following what CWWCS considered a slow response by Apple to their initial request for the materials' removal. 

<p>Thursday's decision is the second in four months from the same court ordering Apple to pay damages for copyright infringement. Apple is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323300404578205281801652860.html">currently appealing</a> [Washington Post report] a September order by the court to pay $83,000 for alleged copyright infringement of a Chinese encyclopedia publisher. Apple has also been on both ends of multiple patent challenges with Samsung recently. In October, the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-judge-lifts-injunction-against-samsung.php">lifted a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/GT-P5113TSYXAR">Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1</a> [product backgrounder], which was granted during a patent infringement suit brought by Apple against <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung</a> [corporate website].

Samsung <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/28/us-apple-samsung-lawsuit-idUSBRE8BR0GI20121228">began sales</a> [Reuters report] of the Mini in Europe this October following Apple's release of its <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-iphone-00001&siclientid=5894&sessguid=fdc443d7-50d9-494d-9ca4-b6f12daabf3f&userguid=fdc443d7-50d9-494d-9ca4-b6f12daabf3f&permguid=fdc443d7-50d9-494d-9ca4-b6f12daabf3f">iPhone 5</a> [product backgrounder]. Despite allegations from Apple that the Mini could be purchased and shipped to the US, Samsung has continuously asserted that the product will neither encroach upon Apple's US market sales nor enter the country's stream of commerce. Last month, the same federal court allowed Apple to <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/federal-judge-allows-apple-samsung-to-add-products-to-patent-lawsuit.php">add claims</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung's Galaxy S III Mini, Galaxy Note, and the Jelly Bean operating system to the original lawsuit filed in February of this year. Originally filed by Apple, the lawsuit alleges that the various Samsung smart phones and tablets infringe eight of Apple's patents, and in response Samsung has filed cross-complaints alleging that Apple's iPhone and iPad infringe eight of its patents. The lawsuit is one of two pending <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/lhk/applevsamsung">patent infringement cases</a> [materials] between the two companies, and is currently scheduled for trial in 2014. 

<p>Apple and Samsung have been embroiled in continuous patent litigation in courts around the world. In October, the Dutch <a href="http://www.rechtspraak.nl/Organisatie/Gerechtshoven/Den-Haag/Pages/default%202.aspx">Rechtbank's-Gravenhage</a> [official website] court ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/dutch-court-rules-samsung-did-not-infringe-apple-patent.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple software patent. That same month, a UK court also ruled that Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/uk-appeals-court-rules-samsung-tablets-do-not-infringe-on-apple-design.php">did not infringe</a> [JURIST report] on an Apple design patent. In the same time frame Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/apple-appeals-tokyo-courts-ruling-for-samsung.php">appealed a Tokyo District Court ruling</a> [JURIST report] which dismissed the company's claim that Samsung had infringed on its patents. At the beginning of October, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/jurist-the-us-court-of.php">reversed an injunction </a> [JURIST report] against Samsung that prevented it from selling its <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SPH-L700ZKASPR">Galaxy Nexus</a> [product backgrounder]. Earlier in August, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/apple-patents-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules.php">won a $1.05 billion judgment</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern District of California against Samsung involving other patent infringements. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A Russian judge found that there was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/12/201212289214169592.html">no evidence</a> [Al Jazeera report] showing a causal link between Kratov's negligence and Magnitsky's death. Dr. Kratov was the head of medical services at Butyrka Prison, where Magnitsky died from untreated pancreatitis. An investigation conducted by Russia's <a href="http://eng.state.kremlin.ru/council/18/news">Presidential Council on Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/report-alleges-corruption,%20torture-in-russia-lawyer-prison-death.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that in addition to being denied medical treatment Magnitsky had been severely beaten during his year long pretrial incarceration. Kratov was accused of negligence for allegedly refusing to respond to repeated requests by Magnitsky to treat his life-threatening condition. Acquittal had been expected as earlier this week the prosecution dropped their accusations, stating they no longer believed there was any connection between Kratov's actions and Magnitsky's death. Kratov had pleaded not guility, citing a shortage of staff as the main factor behind his inability to treat Magnitsky. Magnitsky's family and lawyers said <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/world/prison-doctor-in-magnitsky-trial-acquitted-1.4385352">Kratov's trial was a sham</a> [Newsday report], and stated that Kratov should be held responsible for his role in Magnitksky's death.

<p>Magnitsky, a lawyer for the <a href="http://hermitagefund.com/">Hermitage Capital Fund</a> [official website], was arrested in 2008 by <a href="http://eng.mvdrf.ru/">Russian Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in English] officials on suspicion of tax evasion after he accused the ministry of embezzling $230 million from the state. The <a href="http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Home.Home">US Helsinki Commission</a> [official website] has implicated 60 Russian government officials in the Magnitsky case, but only Kratov has been tried. Earlier this month, the US Congress passed the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1039/text">Magnitsky Act</a> [text] in the lawyer's name, which will allow the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/about/Pages/Secretary.aspx">US Secretary of the Treasury</a> [official website] to freeze assets, prohibit all transactions and deny visas to Russians implicated in human rights abuses. In retaliation, Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">JURIST news archive</a>] on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/putin-signs-russia-adoption-ban-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that prohibits US citizens from adopting Russian children.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

In their brief, Mexico's lawyers <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/free/20121227arizona-immigration-law-mexico-court-harboring-ban.html">argued</a> [AP report] that the prohibition harms diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico and encourages the marginalization of Mexicans and individuals who appear to be Latin American. In addition, the brief stated, "Mexico cannot conduct effective negotiations with the United States when the foreign policy decisions of the federal governments are undermined by the individual policies of individual states" The harboring ban had been in effect since its inception in July 2010 until it was <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-upholds-arizona-immigration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> in September.

<p><a href="/feature/featured/immigration/">Immigration laws</a> [JURIST backgrounder] have become a hot button issue over the past few years, as many states, Arizona being the first, passed laws giving state and local officials more power to crack down on illegal immigration. In June, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-partially-strikes-down-arizona-immigration-law-but-upholds-controversial-section.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/arizona-v-united-states/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Arizona v. United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] to strike down sections of the Arizona law, but upheld the controversial portion allowing police officers to check immigration status of anyone arrested. In August, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/federal-appeals-court-partially-rejects-alabama-and-georgia-immigration-laws.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of Alabama's controversial law <a href="http://media.al.com/bn/other/Alabama%20Immigration%20Law%202011.pdf">HB 56</a> [text, PDF], upheld a few sections of the law and rejected part of Georgia's law <a href="http://girrc.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/hb-87-final-as-passed-by-house-and-senate-116631.pdf">HB 87</a> [text, PDF]. That same month, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] again <a href="/paperchase/2012/08/third-circuit-reconsiders-hazleton-anti-illegal-immigration-ordinances.php">heard arguments for the second time</a> [JURIST report] on two immigration laws enacted in 2006 by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which deny permits to businesses that employ illegal immigrants and fine landlords who extend housing to them.

The rules, called the Decision to Strengthen the Protection of Online Information, were adopted by China's highest legislative body, the <a href="http://english.gov.cn/2005-09/02/content_28456.htm">National People's Congress Standing Committee</a> (NPCSC) [official website], after one reading and without any public consultation. The decision by the NPCSC includes provisions requiring that all land-line phone, mobile phone, and Internet service contracts are provided only to people who give their real names to their providers and it imposes an obligation on the ISPs to monitor, delete, and report to the government any online content the ISP determines is illegal. While many critics fear that the new push will <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1114741/critics-fear-npcs-new-rules-digital-information-will-stifle-internet">stifle online speech</a> [South China Morning Post report], the decision's text claims that the new rule will "ensure Internet information security, safeguard the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal entities or other organizations and safeguard national security and social public interests."

<p>China has faced criticism for its policy of strict Internet regulation. In July the government suggested rules that would limit <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/china-government-proposes-new-regulations-restricting-internet-use.php">anonymous posting online</a> [JURIST report]. In 2010, the <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/">State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China</a> [official website, in Chinese] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-government-cites-human-rights-improvements.php">released a position paper</a> [JURIST report] on the country's human rights record, claiming that it has heightened Internet freedoms and improved civil and political rights. In July of that year, Chinese Internet regulators planned to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/China-looks-to-increase-Internet-regulation,-decrease-anonymity.php">drastically reduce Internet anonymity</a> [JURIST report] by requiring people to use their real names when posting on certain Chinese websites, according to <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/">Human Rights in China</a> (HRIC) [advocacy website]. HRIC's revelation came on the heels of a June announcement that Google would continue to operate its <a href="http://www.google.cn/">google.cn</a> Internet search engine in mainland China, ending a four-month period during which the site simply redirected to the uncensored <a href="http://www.google.com.hk/webhp?hl=zh-CN&sourceid=cnhp">google.hk</a> [search websites; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/google-stops-censoring-china-search.php">report</a>] after the company threatened in January to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-hacking-of-activists-e-mail.php">pull out of China entirely</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/china-government-defends-internet-censorship-laws.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] its Internet censorship laws in a report on Internet usage in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, known as the <a href="/paperchase/20121221-RA-10354-BSA.pdf">Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act</a> [text, PDF], was passed by the legislature <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/philippines-legislature-approves-reproductive-health-bill.php">earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] after more than 13 years of national debate over the issue. The Catholic Church, which remains an influential institution in the Philippines as 80 percent of the population is Catholic, opposes the bill, arguing that it will lead to the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/17/world/asia/philippines-health-bill/index.html">destruction of marriage and morality</a> [CNN report] in the country. The bill's opponents have attacked provisions which will result in tax revenue going to free condoms and birth control pills for indigent couples, sex education classes beginning in the sixth grade for students, and medical treatment for women who suffer post-abortion complications, though the nation still forbids the practice of abortions. The law is still subject to a constitutionality challenge in the nation's <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. Catholic officials have also announced they <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/331815/catholic-leaders-vow-to-ensure-defeat-of-lp-candidates-in-2013-polls-over-rh-law">plan to fight</a> [Philippine Daily Inquirer report] to unseat those who supported the legislation. 

<p>The right to sex education and contraceptives, particularly funding issues, continues to be a global issue. In October, France <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/france-house-passes-bill-to-pay-for-abortions-contraceptives-for-minors.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill to pay for contraceptive and abortion coverage for minors. The day before that, a US federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/federal-appeals-court-declines-to-rehear-texas-planned-parenthood-funding-case.php">declined to rehear</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/greater-texas/">Texas Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] funding case in which it ruled that the state could prohibit funding of facilities that perform abortions. In September an Illinois appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/illinois-appeals-court-rules-pharmacists-can-refuse-to-dispense-birth-control-drugs.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that pharmacists can refuse to dispense birth control drugs if they have religious objections to them. In May the <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/house/">Tennessee House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/107/Bill/HB3621.pdf">passed a bill</a> [PDF, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/tennessee-legislature-passes-abstinence-only-sex-education-bill.php">report</a>] that augments the state's abstinence-only sex education curriculum to allow parents to sue school teachers or organizations who promote "gateway sexual activity". In 2009 a German court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-high-court-rejects-religious.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] on religious grounds to mandatory sex education.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The company, owned by a Roman Catholic couple, claim that the mandate "substantially burdens their exercise of religion" under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.2043:">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [text]. The ruling is the first time that a federal court at this level has enjoined the contraception mandate for a non-religious organization, but for a company operated by strongly religious owners. According to the court: <blockquote>"[T]he Kortes have established a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that the contraception mandate imposes a substantial burden on their religious exercise. As such, the burden will be on the government to demonstrate that the contraception mandate is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest."</blockquote>In a two-to-one ruling, the court stated "an injunction pending appeal temporarily interferes with the government&#8217;s goal of increasing cost-free access to contraception and sterilization. That interest, while not insignificant, is outweighed by the harm to the substantial religious-liberty interests on the other side." The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled last week to <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/supreme-court-justice-denies-injunction-against-contraceptive-coverage-mandate.php">deny Hobby Lobby, Inc.'s application</a> [JURIST report] for injunction against the contraceptive coverage mandate.  Hobby Lobby, Inc. and Mardel Inc. <a href = "/paperchase/2012/12/two-businesses-will-not-comply-with-supreme-courts-order-on-contraception-mandate.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] later that week that they will not comply with Justice Sonia Sotomayor's order.

More than forty lawsuits have been filed challenging the PPACA provision. Last week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.moed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-judge-blocks-missouri-birth-control-coverage-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a Missouri law which prohibits mandatory insurance coverage of birth control for any employers with ethical or religious objections, finding that the state law conflicts with the PPACA. The <a href="http://www.moinsurancecoalition.com/">Missouri Insurance Coalition</a> [official website] sought to have the state law blocked, arguing that it is invalid because it conflicts with federal law. Earlier this month, attorneys for the federal government filed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/federal-court-urged-to-dismiss-oklahoma-challenge-to-health-care-law.php">motion</a> [JURIST report] with the US District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma to dismiss a complaint challenging the PPACA. Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt had filed a suit in January against the federal health care law arguing that "Congress had exceeded its Article I powers by enacting the Act's minimum coverage provision. Last month the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/supreme-court-orders-rehearing-in-health-care-case.php">remanded</a> a case concerning the contraception mandate, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">Liberty University v. Geithner</a> [JURIST reports], to the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website]. The court ordered the lower court to re-consider the case in light of <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/supreme-court-upholds-health-care-law.php">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [JURIST report], in which the Supreme Court decided in June that the PPACA is a constitutionally valid exercise of Congress' powers under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag26_user.html">Taxing Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

FISA grants the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] the authority to conduct surveillance of Americans&#8217; phone calls and emails in attempts to protect against terrorism and other foreign threats. The law renews 2008 revisions which call for special government programs, such as the National Security Agency  <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=warrantless+surveillance+program">warrantless surveillance program</a> [JURIST news archive], to be operated under court supervision. It also allows the government to collect communications from US companies regarding foreigners abroad so long as the foreigner is overseas. Though the issue of warrantless searches of Americans remains controversial, the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/jurist-the-us-house-of.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 300 to 118 in September to extend the law for an additional five years. The <a href = "http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/national-security/senate-reauthorizes-warrantless-wiretapping">criticized the reauthorization</a> [press release], describing it as "an unconstitutional spying bill that violates the Fourth Amendment and gives vast, unchecked surveillance authority to the government."

<p>FISA has been controversial since its inception in 1978 and remains controversial in <a href = "/feature/featured/911/">post-9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder] America. In February, arguments were made that the law <a href="/forum/2012/02/tung-yin-fisa.php">too heavily favors the government</a> by creating an impossible evidentiary burden for defendants, and that Congress may have <a href="/forum/2012/02/jimmy-gurule-fisa.php">chosen to protect national security interests</a> [JURIST op-eds] over those of criminal defendants without considering the constitution. Most recently, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-appeals-court-upholds-telecom-company-immunity-law.php">declared the law constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The House amendments to FISA in 2008 originally <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/house-passes-fisa-amendment-granting.php">granted retroactive immunity</a> [JURIST report] to telecommunications companies that participated in the NSA warrantless surveillance program. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The woman, a 23-year-old medical student, was <a href="http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/29/16230911-india-charges-six-suspects-with-murder-after-victim-of-horrific-gang-rape-dies?lite">gang raped on a bus</a> [NBC report] in New Delhi on December 16 and died in a Singapore hospital on Saturday. The suspects, who were arrested shortly after the attack, included five men between the ages of 20 and 40 and one man under the age of 18. The rape has sparked a larger debate about violence against women in India. <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Saturday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/29/india-rape-victim-s-death-demands-action">called for new laws</a> [press release] to protect victims and crack down on perpetrators of rape and sexual assault.  Indian Home Minister <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3722572.ece">Sushilkumar Shinde</a> [<em>The Hindu</em> backgrounder] said that the government was seeking the harshest possible punishment for the six suspects, which could include the death penalty.

<p>India has been the focal point of several recent controversies concerning the issues of rape and sexual rights. Last week India <a href="http://pmindia.nic.in/">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/india-prime-minister-calls-for-peace-after-rape-protests.php">called for peace</a> [JURIST report] after a protest over sexual violence resulted in a clash between protesters and police. In February the Indian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/india-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-legality-of-homosexuality.php">heard additional arguments</a> [JURIST report] challenging the decriminalization of homosexual intercourse. In 2009, the Delhi High Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/india-court-declares-anti-sodomy-law.php">decriminalized homosexual conduct</a> [JURIST report] by declaring India's anti-sodomy law unconstitutional. In 2008, the UN found significant evidence that <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/india-peacekeeping-troops-accused-of.php">Indian peacekeeping troops committed sex-crimes</a> [JURIST report] while stations with the UN Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was sponsored by <a href="http://donnachristensen.house.gov/">Congresswoman Donna Christensen</a> [official website], the Virgin Islands' congressional delegate. Christensen introduced the bill after the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] issued a report recommending that Virgin Islands high court decisions be reviewed directly by the US Supreme Court. Prior to the direct review bill, the Third Circuit heard appeals from the Virgin Islands Supreme Court. Christensen <a href="http://stcroixsource.com/content/news/local-news/2012/12/29/president-signs-vi-supreme-court-bill-law">praised the direct review bill</a> [<em>St. Croix Source</em> report] as a further step toward self-government for the Virgin Islands.

<p>Because the Third Circuit will no longer hears appeals from the Virgin Islands Supreme Court, the Virgin Islands' court system now functions like a state's, as high court decisions are reviewed by the US Supreme Court rather than a federal appeals court. Christensen <a href="http://donnachristensen.house.gov/press-release/christensen-introduces-legislation-allow-direct-appeals-vi-supreme-court-us-supreme">introduced the bill in July</a> [press release] following the Third Circuit's report.

Two weeks ago the <a href="http://senate.gov">US Senate</a> [official website] also <a href="http://donnachristensen.house.gov/press-release/united-states-senate-passes-vi-supreme-court-bill">unanimously passed the bill</a> [press release]. After the direct review bill passed the Senate, Christensen touted the bill's historical importance: "All Virgin Islands will look back upon this time with great pride and gratitude for the way in which they laid the foundation for appellate jurisprudence in the territory that is second to none."</p>]]></content:encoded>
