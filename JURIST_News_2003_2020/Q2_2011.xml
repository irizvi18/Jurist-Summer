The measure passed 40-10 after receiving a similarly <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-house-passes-anti-same-sex-marriage-amendment.php">lop-sided victory</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">House of Representatives</a> [official website] last month. The amendment would <a href="http://www.wibc.com/news/Story.aspx?id=1393131">reaffirm Indiana's 25-year-old statutory ban on gay marriage</a> [WIBC report]. Opponents of the amendment expressed concern that it will <a href="http://www.southbendtribune.com/sbt-indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-amendment-to-ban-gay-marriages-20110329,0,6093284.story">make Indiana appear unwelcoming and deter talented workers</a> [<em>South Bend Tribune</em> report] from coming to the state. Proponents insist the amendment is necessary because the <a href="http://www.purdueexponent.org/city/article_d085ec5e-5b2b-11e0-9fb5-0017a4a78c22.html">judiciary can easily repeal a statute</a> [<em>The Exponent</em> report]. The amendment would have to be approved again in a newly-elected House and Senate before being submitted to voters in 2014 at the earliest.

<p>The issue of same-sex marriage continues to be hotly debated in the US. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], which defines marriage for federal purposes as a legal union between one man and one woman, in court cases challenging the provision. Also in February, Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-governor-signs-same-sex-unions-bill-into-law.php">signed a same-sex civil unions bill into law</a>, while the Wyoming Senate approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">prevent the state from recognizing same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST reports] and civil unions performed in other jurisdictions. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington, DC</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two-page order does not reveal the results of the vote other than indicating a majority voted against it. The order confirms that the appeal will nonetheless be expedited. Oral arguments are currently scheduled for June 8 before a randomly-selected three-judge panel. The identities of the panel members will not be disclosed until at least 14 days before the arguments.

<p>Earlier this month, the Obama administration filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/US-resp-to-en-banc-11th-CA-11-11021.pdf">brief</a> [PDF] with the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-contests-en-banc-review-of-health-care-law.php">contesting the plaintiff states' request</a> [JURIST report] to have the appeal heard by an <em>en banc</em> court. Also this month, the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/11th-circuit-agrees-to-expedited-health-care-appeal.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] the Obama administration's motion for an expedited appeal. Last month, Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">petition for a <em>writ of certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+supreme+court">Supreme Court</a> [JURIST news archive] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rules on the issue, but the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-expedited-health-care-review.php">opposes the petition</a> [JURIST report]. In January, a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled that the law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ICJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/icj-begins-hearing-on-jurisdiction-over-georgia-russia-conflict.php">began hearings</a> [JURIST report] on the case after Russia challenged the court's jurisdiction to hear the controversy in late 2009, arguing that the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> (CERD) [materials] is inapplicable as Georgia and Russia were not engaged in a dispute over ethnic discrimination prior to the filing of the allegations. The ICJ dismissed Russia's objection, holding that there was a dispute between the nations, but the court found that the parties had not completed possible negotiations, a procedural requirement that must be fulfilled before parties may bring their dispute to the ICJ:<blockquote>The Court concludes that the facts in the record show that, between 9 August and 12 August 2008, Georgia did not attempt to negotiate CERD-related matters with the Russian Federation, and that, consequently, Georgia and the Russian Federation did not engage in negotiations with respect to the latter's compliance with its substantive obligations under CERD.</blockquote> According to a member of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Russian government <a href="http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=23302">supports the ICJ decision</a> [Civil Georgia report]. However, Georgia's Deputy Minister of Justice Tina Burjaliani emphasized that "the court has left open the possibility that the case can proceed once the formal conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction ... have been met," suggesting that Georgian officials will <a href="http://www.civil.ge/files/files/2011/GovtofGeorgiaICJPress%20Release.pdf">continue to pursue the case</a> [press release]. 

<p>The dispute between Russian and Georgia is not limited to the proceedings before the ICJ. Last year, representatives from Russia <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/icc-prosecutors-meet-with-russia.php">met with prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to discuss claims of war crimes allegedly committed by Georgian soldiers during the conflict in South Ossetia in August 2008. That conflict occurred when Russia sent its military into Georgia in response to a Georgian bid to strike South Ossetia, an area heavily populated by Russians. The US has taken the position that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">both nations committed human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] during that conflict. Georgia initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/georgia-files-complaint-against-russia.php">brought the case</a> [JURIST report] before the ICJ in August 2008, shortly after Russia sent troops into Georgia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, which allows for prosecution even <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110331001070">in the absence of a complaining witness</a> [<em>Korea Herald</em> report], has been part of the Korean military criminal code since 1962. Despite the controversy surrounding the law, relatively few individuals have been prosecuted. Between 2004 and 2007, 176 individuals faced charges, with three cases resulting in prison sentences. The court <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110331/lf_afp/skoreamilitarylawsex_20110331143015">upheld the law in a 5-4 ruling</a> [AFP report], citing a need to maintain discipline in the armed forces. Under the civil code of Korea, homosexuality is not illegal.

<p>In October, the <a href="http://www.humanrights.go.kr/00_main/main.jsp">National Human Rights Commission of South Korea</a> [official website, in Korean] issued a report stating that it <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/south-korea-rights-commission-finds-military-gay-ban-unconstitutional.php">found the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], and calling for the law to be repealed. In the US, until recently, open homosexuality has been an exclusionary factor for service in the armed forces. In December, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/senate-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">Senate voted to repeal</a> [JURIST report] the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy implemented during the Clinton administration. The House of Representatives had <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/house-votes-to-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell.php">passed a bill repealing the law</a> [JURIST report] earlier the same week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The detentions were part of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3720724.stm">"Operation Condor"</a> [BBC backgrounder], a campaign by the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay to round up left-wing dissidents.

Two former intelligence agents, Honorio Martinez and Eduardo Ruffo, each received 25-year prison terms, and former military intelligence officer Raul Guglielminetti received a 20-year sentence. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people were forcibly kidnapped or "disappeared" during the government's campaign against suspected dissidents during the country's Dirty War. 

<p>Argentina continues to prosecute those accused of committing human rights abuses during the Dirty War.

Also in March, an Argentine court commenced the trial of former dictators <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/index.php?id=801&L=5&tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=jorge-rafael_videla_151&cHash=0bcbee03a1">Jorge Videla</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jorge+videla">news archive</a>] and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Reynaldo+Bignone">Reynaldo Bignone</a> [JURIST news archive] for allegedly overseeing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/argentina-court-begins-trial-over-dirty-war-baby-thefts.php">systematic plan to steal babies</a> [JURIST report] born to political prisoners. In December, Videla was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/argentina-ex-dictator-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity.

<p>On Thursday, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ACA-11th-CA-en-banc-denial-3-31-11.pdf">denied</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/eleventh-circuit-declines-full-panel-hearing-of-health-care-appeal.php">report</a>] the petition for initial hearing <em>en banc</em> in the health care reform law appeal, but confirmed that the appeal will nonetheless be expedited. Oral arguments are currently scheduled for June 8 before a randomly-selected three-judge panel. Last month, Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli filed a petition for a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">writ of certiorari</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+supreme+court">Supreme Court</a> [JURIST news archive] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rules on the issue, but the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-expedited-health-care-review.php">opposes the petition</a> [JURIST report]</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chavez, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/mexico-president-replaces-attorney.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] just 18 months ago, resigned amid criticism over how he handled the position. Three weeks ago, a US diplomatic cable released through <a href="http://www.wikileaks.ch/wiki/Main_Page">WikiLeaks</a> [website] described Chavez's appointment as <a href="http://wikileaks.jornada.com.mx/cables/gobierno-felipe-calderon/controvertida-nominacion-de-arturo-chavez-chavez-como-procurador-general-cable-09mexico2701/">"totally unexpected and politically inexplicable"</a> [text]. The leaked cable continued:<blockquote>Chavez has strong detractors within the Mexican human rights community because of his perceived failings in dealing with the murder of a large number of women in Ciudad Juarez, at a time when he was ratcheting up the fight against drug cartels. The killings gained international attention and leading human rights organizations at home and abroad charged Chavez with failing to energetically pursue the cases and even claimed that he had covered up evidence.</blockquote>Chavez's popularity was also affected by his failure to convict any of the <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/mexico-forces-arrest-public-officials.php">public officials arrested</a> [JURIST report] for their connection to the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103178523"><em>La Familia</em> drug cartel</a> [NPR backgrounder]. <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-mexico-attorney-general-20110401,0,4593286.story">nominated Marisela Morales</a> [LAT report] to replace Chavez. Morales will be the first woman to serve as Mexico's attorney general. 

<p>Mexico has struggled to combat the drug cartels' influence on the government and the country as a whole. There have been <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20101215-mexico-and-cartel-wars-2010?utm_source=SWeekly&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=101216&utm_content=readmore&elq=b1b5d866b6a74b31a7b5ad7de5742eaf">more than 27,000 drug-related deaths since 2006</a> [STRATFOR report], and the violence has steadily escalated over the last few years. In April 2009, Mexico's Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/mexico-senate-approves-pre-conviction.php">passed a constitutional amendment</a> [JURIST report] permitting the seizure of suspected drug traffickers' property prior to their conviction.

The bill, which was prompted by Nebraska's decision to ban abortions performed <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">after 20 weeks of gestation</a> [JURIST report], was passed by the Republican-held body to preemptively prohibit a Nebraska doctor from <a href="http://www.timesrepublican.com/page/content.detail/id/538513/House-approves-ban-on-abortions----.html">performing the procedure</a> [AP report] in Iowa. The doctor indicated after the procedure was banned in Nebraska that he would open a clinic in Iowa near the Nebraska border in order to continue offering the procedure to women. Democratic critics of the bill likened it to using a <a href="http://iowahouse.org/2011/03/31/house-opens-debate-on-womans-health-and-pregnancy/">sledge hammer to kill a fly</a> [statement]. The bill, which does not include an exception for rape or incest, requires that late term pregnancy complications meet a threshold of "immediate danger" to garner exception from the ban. The legislation is justified as a way to protect women's health stating, "Abortion has a higher medical risk when the procedure is performed later in the pregnancy. Compared to an abortion at eight weeks gestation or earlier, the relative risk increases exponentially at higher gestations. The incidence of major complications is highest after twenty weeks of gestation." Friday's bill follows Iowa's third anti-abortion bill which passed on Wednesday, and calls for strict regulations of clinics and doctor's offices where abortions are provided. The legislation must now be approved by the state's Senate where it is unclear whether the measure has enough support for approval.  

<p>Several state legislatures have recently passed <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/arizona-governor-outlaws-abortion-based-on-sex-or-race.php">restrictions on abortions</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, South Dakota <a href="http://www.sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed </a>[JURIST report] HB 1217 into law, requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Also in March, the <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/">Missouri House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in favor of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">restricting late-term abortions</a> [JURIST report] and imposing penalties on doctors who fail to comply with the new restrictions. The legislation, which is slated to become effective at the end of August, bans abortions of "viable" fetuses. The <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/">Oklahoma House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in March to approve a bill that would ban abortion <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">after 20 weeks of gestation</a> [JURIST report]. In February, the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/chamber/house/">Kansas House of Representatives</a> [official website] also approved several <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">new restrictions on abortion</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, reports from inside Abidjan indicated the pro-Ouattara Invisible Commando group <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/ghanaNews/idAFLDE7300WI20110401?sp=true">continued to commit abuses</a> [Reuters report]. The OHCHR cautioned both sides, indicating that the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] as well as the recently established Commission of Inquiry for Cote d'Ivoire were already present and would <a href="http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/pro-ouattara-forces-committing-rights-breaches-un-rights_139755.html">investigate abuses by all sides</a> [AFP report].

Gbagbo's whereabouts are unknown.

<p>Gbagbo has refused to cede power to president-elect Ouattara, who won the November 28 runoff election according to international observers. Last week, the OHCHR <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10893&LangID=E">announced</a> [press release] that the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] will send an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-human-rights-council-to-investigate-human-rights-abuses-in-ivory-coast.php">independent international commission to investigate</a> [JURIST report] allegations of serious human rights abuses during post-election violence in the Ivory Coast. Last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">OHCHR called for an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into post-election violence as part of a report to the UNHRC.

Representatives for the plaintiffs indicated that they were pleased with the ruling, which will force Samantar to face his accusers. Samantar continues to deny any wrongdoing and was not present at Friday's hearing. 

<p>In February, a federal judge rules that Samantar was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-denies-immunity-to-former-somalia-pm.php">not entitled to legal immunity from civil lawsuits</a> [JURIST report].  This ruling came after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] handed down a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on.php">unanimous decision</a> [JURIST report] in June that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> (FSIA) [28 USC &#167; &#167; 1330, 1602 et seq. text] does not provide foreign officials immunity from civil lawsuits.  The suit has been ongoing since 2004 when the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking damages from Samantar under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991</a> [28 USC &#167; 1350 text]. Samantar was minister of defense and later prime minister of Somalia from 1980 to 1990. Respondents claim that Samantar authorized torture and the extrajudicial killing of them and members of their family. The Isaaq clan, of which the plaintiffs are members, was subjected to systematic persecution during Samantar's time in office before the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2863.htm">collapse of the Somali government in 1991</a> [DOS backgrounder]. Samantar fled Somalia before the collapse of the government and now resides in Virginia.<br />

A spokesperson for the ICRC condemned the violence, which has been ongoing in the area since last Monday: "We are shocked by the brutality and scale of this act.  The ICRC condemns any and all direct attacks on the civilian population and reminds the parties to the conflict of their obligation to protect, in all circumstances, the population of the territory under their control."  The ICRC stated that the death toll was calculated by field delegates and volunteers, and warned that they believe there is a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gWA0SNcZPfb1_WSsbf-tnb8qAcJw?docId=46f190bd176d46c7a3ad26badeecbbd5">risk that another mass killing could occur</a> [AP report] in the area. A UN military spokesman indicated that the UN was aware of fighting in the region, but unaware of any reports of mass killings.

<p>On Friday, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-restraint-caution-in-ivory-coast.php">urged all parties in the Ivory Coast to show restraint</a> [JURIST report].  A spokesperson acknowledged unconfirmed reports that the Ivory Coast Republican Forces had "engaged in looting and extortion as well as serious human rights violations such as abductions, arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment of civilians" during their advance towards the country's capital of Abidjan.  The violence stems from former president Laurent Gbagbo's refusal to cede power to president-elect Alassane Ouattara who won the November 28 runoff election according to international observers.  Last month, the OHCHR called for<a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php"> an independent investigation into post-election violence</a> [JURIST report].  In January, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-warns-of-possible-ivory-coast-genocide.php">UN officials expressed "grave concerns"</a> [JURIST report] regarding the post-election violence, cautioning that genocide could be imminent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Germany's human rights commissioner, Markus Loening, requested that the drug <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/germany-urges-european-export-ban-of-us-execution-drug-sodium-thiopental/2011/04/01/AF3Da5HC_story.html">sodium thiopental be placed on the list of drugs</a> [AP report] that require governmental consent prior to export. Sodium thiopental is one of three drugs used in the lethal injection sequence and is manufactured by three German companies that sell the drug locally for anesthesia purposes. Loening indicated that it was important that no drugs from Germany or the EU were used in US executions. US states are facing shortages of the drug following an announcement by <a href="http://www.hospira.com/default.aspx">Hospira, Inc.</a> [official website], the sole US manufacturer of the drug, that it will cease production of sodium thiopental. The <a href="http://www.bundesaerztekammer.de/">German Medical Association</a> and the <a href="http://www.aifd.org.tr/en/anasayfa.aspx">Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies</a> [official websites] endorse the ban on sodium thiopental exports to the US. Capital punishment is prohibited in the EU.

<p>The shortage of sodium thiopental in the US has caused several states to modify lethal injection protocol, which has lead to a number of constitutional challenges by death row inmates. In March, two Texas inmates <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-03-30-RWexecutiondrug30_ST_N.htm">requested stays on their executions</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report] to obtain more information on the new protocol and possibly challenge the protocol as unconstitutional. Texas acknowledged that its supply of sodium thiopental had an expiration date of March 1. Arizona, Georgia and Oklahoma have faced similar challenges and are seeking to substitute the sodium thiopental used in the lethal injection "cocktail" with pentobarbital. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/us/02lethal.html">Kentucky and Tennessee surrendered supplies of sodium thiopental</a> [NYT report] to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) [official website] after the agency seized Georgia's supply in order to investigate whether the drug was properly imported. In September, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/27/10_99019_Morales_Brown_ord.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] a district court judge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-halts-california-execution.php">reconsider the stay of execution</a> [JURIST report] in the case of Albert Brown. The court noted that the timing of Brown's execution was influenced by the expiration of the state's supply of sodium thiopental, and stated that it was "incredible to think that the deliberative process might be driven by the expiration date of the execution drug."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Paul Allen pleaded guilty to making false statements and conspiring to commit bank and wire fraud for his role in a USD $1.5 billion fraud scheme that contributed to the failure of the mortgage company. Allen admitted that from 2005 through August 2009 he and other co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud financial institutions that had invested in a lending facility called Ocala Funding. In an effort to cover up inadequate assets backing its commercial paper, Allen told a co-conspirator to produce fraudulent reports and knew that these reports were sent to Ocala Funding investors and other third parties. The cover-up led investors in <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.colonialbankfsb.com/">Colonial Bank</a> [corporate websites] and Ocala Funding to believe they had an undivided ownership interest in thousands of the same mortgage loans. Allen also admitted to making false statements in a letter to the US <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD">Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> [official website], omitting concerns raised by an independent auditor. Five other individuals have pleaded guilty for their roles in related fraud schemes. Allen will be sentenced in June, when he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each count.

<p>A <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/June/10-crm-703.html">grand jury indicted</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/former-mortgage-company-ceo-indicted-on-tarp-fraud-charges.php">report</a>] the former chairman of TBW, Lee Farkas, in June, alleging that he and his co-conspirators engaged in a USD $1.9 billion complex fraud scheme that contributed to the failure of Colonial Bank in order to cover financial losses suffered by TBW. The federal government continues to investigate possible cases of fraud that may have played a role in the recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=financial+crisis">financial crisis</a> [JURIST news archive]. In April 2010, the DOJ announced a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/done-justice-department-opens-investigation-on-goldman-sachs-report.php">criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co.</a> [corporate website] for possible securities fraud in mortgage trading.

In November 2009, two former Bear Stearns hedge fund managers were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/former-bear-stearns-fund-managers.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] of securities-related charges. The June 2008 SEC <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp20625.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleged that the managers had taken leveraged positions in financial derivatives based on subprime mortgage-based assets and then taken steps to conceal ensuing losses from investors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Goldstone Report, which <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/un-report-finds-both-israel-and.php">found that Israel committed war crimes</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">Operation Cast Lead</a> [JURIST news archive] after a fact finding mission, was called into question Friday by Goldstone's article, where he said: "if I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document." According to Goldstone, new evidence has shown that Israel never targeted civilians in the conflict as originally alleged. <blockquote>The allegations of intentionality by Israel were based on the deaths of and injuries to civilians in situations where our fact-finding mission had no evidence on which to draw any other reasonable conclusion. While the investigations published by the Israeli military and recognized in the U.N. committee&#8217;s report have established the validity of some incidents that we investigated in cases involving individual soldiers, they also indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy.</blockquote>Goldstone went on to commend Israel and the Palestinian Authority for conducting investigations into the report's allegations, noting that Hamas had not done so. He also noted the positive effect the report had in the conflict, leading to reforms in the conduct of the Israel Defense Forces. Citing these statements, Netanyahu <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201142231017418.html">called for the report to be nullified</a> [Al Jazeera report].

<p>The report said that Israel regularly and impermissibly disregarded the welfare of civilians and even targeted them during the conflict in violation of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5">Fourth Geneva Convention</a>, and the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079">First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention</a> [texts]. The report also found that Israel failed to look into alleged misconduct by its soldiers and used <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/wp.htm">white phosphorous</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] in violation of international law. The report accused Palestinian fighters of firing mortars indiscriminately into civilian areas and mistreating prisoner of war <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gilad+shalit">Gilad Shalit</a> [JURIST news archive] in violation of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/6fef854a3517b75ac125641e004a9e68">Third Geneva Convention</a> [text].

The plaintiffs had challenged three provisions of the law which require reports of third-party disbursements, a $360,000 trigger of supplemental grants to candidates that elect for public financing and a $1,000 cap on individual contributions made to privately-funded candidates. In upholding the law, Judge William M. Conley found the plaintiffs were not unduly burdened by the law and that any burden on their First Amendment rights was outweighed by the state's "compelling interest in the election of justices to its highest court free from an appearance of bias." Conley did acknowledge, however, that his decision may be undermined by the US Supreme Court's <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">expected ruling on the appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a similar Arizona campaign financing law:<blockquote>Obviously, even the narrow holding by this court today may be undermined by the Supreme Court's decision in <em>McComish</em>, and the court considered a decision on the merits here pending further guidance from the Supreme Court ... At the same time, the court is painfully aware that its decision may merely be contributing to public financing's 'death by a thousand cuts,' as Justice Breyer put it during oral argument earlier this week in <em>McComish</em>, recognizing that money, like water seems to find its own level. </blockquote> The plaintiffs said they plan to <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/119015369.html">immediately appeal for emergency relief</a> [MJS report] before the election on Tuesday. 

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] to the Arizona campaign financing case in November. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-239.htm">McComish v. Bennett</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Brief-09-20-10-170201.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether Arizona's matching funds and the law regulating campaign financing to equalize resources among candidates and interest groups, rather than advancing a compelling state interest in the least restrictive manner, violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/07/02/10-15165.pdf">concluded</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Arizona public financing scheme and matching funds provision did not offend the First Amendment.

Bennett</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Brief-09-20-10-170136.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine whether the First Amendment forbids states from providing additional government subsidies to publicly financed candidates that are triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates or by the candidates' privately financed opponents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During the trial, which lasted only one day, Vu's lawyers were <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/04/vietnam-rights-lawyer-jail-democracy">thrown out of court</a> [AP report], and Vu was forced to defend himself. Vu has been in prison since November because of interviews he gave to the international press in which he advocated for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12956496">elimination of the one-party political system</a> [BBC report] in Vietnam and other democratic reforms. His detention has been widely criticized by international human rights groups, including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], which called VU's arrest the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/11/09/vietnam-end-crackdown-lawyers-rights-defenders">latest incident</a> [press release] in a "campaign of repression" against activists. In 2009, Vu sued Vietnamese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5119642.stm">Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung</a> [BBC profile] in connection with a government initiative to develop, in collaboration with China, a bauxite mine. Vu is the son of Cu Huy Can, a leader in former Vietnamese president Ho Chi Minh's government and highly respected poet. 

<p>Vu is among several dissidents in Vietnam who have been convicted for anti-government activity. In January, a Vietnamese court sentenced former communist official Vi Duc Hoi to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy-activist-convicted-of-violating-national-security.php">eight years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for advocating democracy and a multi-party system. In January 2010, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to four years in prison on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. That same month, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion. Following the one-day trial, human rights lawyer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=le+cong+dinh">Le Cong Dinh</a> [JURIST news archive] was sentenced to five years in prison. The four defendants were accused of activities aimed at ending communist rule in Vietnam. Dinh admitted to advocating multi-party democracy in Vietnam and joining the banned Democracy Party. Prior to Dinh's conviction, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/vietnam-court-sentences-pro-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] pro-democracy dissident Tran Anh Kim in December 2009 to five-and-a-half years in prison for subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdoj.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Friday filed a <a href="http://aca-litigation.wikispaces.com/file/view/U.S.+brief+as+appellant+(04.01.11).pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website], arguing that the <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">health care reform law</a> [HR 3590; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>] is constitutional. In January, a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down the law</a> [JURIST report] as a violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution. In its brief, the DOJ argued that the interstate health market can be regulated by Congress because it is fundamentally different from other markets due to the pervasive government involvement in health care spending. It also argued that the minimum coverage provision, which is the focus of the litigation, is constitutional because it regulates only economic activity, disputing the lower court's finding that failure to purchase health insurance could not be regulated as interstate commerce. Citing to the US Supreme Court case of <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-sides-with.php">Gonzales v. Raich</a> [JURIST report], the brief argued that there only needed to be a <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/rational_basis">rational basis</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] for Congress to believe that the regulated conduct substantially affects interstate commerce, which was met here.<blockquote>Congress's findings and the legislative record leave no doubt that the minimum coverage provision&#8212;which regulates the way people pay for services in the interstate health care market&#8212;is a valid exercise of the commerce power under the standards established  by  the  Supreme  Court. It  regulates activity that is commercial and economic in nature, and that substantially affects interstate commerce. First, Congress  found that people who consume health care without insurance shift billions of dollars of costs annually to other participants in the interstate health care market. Second, Congress found that the minimum coverage provision is key to the viability of the Act's regulation of medical underwriting, which guarantees that everyone will be insurable regardless of illnesses or accidents.</blockquote>The DOJ also argued that the law was constitutional as an exercise of Congress's taxing power, and that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the suit in the first place.

<p>The Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/eleventh-circuit-declines-full-panel-hearing-of-health-care-appeal.php">denied the petition for initial hearing <em>en banc</em></a> [JURIST report] in the appeal. The order confirmed that the appeal will nonetheless be expedited. Oral arguments are currently scheduled for June 8 before a randomly-selected three-judge panel. The identities of the panel members will not be disclosed until at least 14 days before the arguments. Last month, the Obama administration filed a brief with the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-contests-en-banc-review-of-health-care-law.php">contesting the plaintiff states' request</a> [JURIST report] to have the appeal heard by an <em>en banc</em> court. Last month, Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">filed a petition for a <em>writ of certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rules on the issue, but the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-expedited-health-care-review.php">opposes the petition</a> [JURIST report]. In January, a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled that the law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-945.htm">Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Brief-02-24-11-174655.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will examine whether a suspect's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights were violated when he was strip searched twice after being arrested for a non-criminal offense and the circumstances did not suggest that he was carrying contraband. Petitioner Albert Florence sued under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00001983----000-.html">42 USC &#167; 1983</a> [text], obtaining summary judgment from the district court, which rejected a categorical rule that all arrestees be strip searched regardless of the alleged crime. The judgment was <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/093603p.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] by the Third Circuit. Florence was arrested in New Jersey after being pulled over when it was discovered that there was an outstanding warrant against him for failure to pay a fine. He produced a letter to the officer that he had paid the fine, but officer made the arrest anyways. Florence was eventually transported to a local jail where he was forced to strip naked for inspection. Florence was then held at the jail for a week while his family tried to secure his release before being transported to another corrections facility where he was again subjected to a strip search. The alleged failure to pay the fine is considered a non-criminal offense in New Jersey. 

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-637.htm">Greene v. Fisher</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/04-01-Greene-cert-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the Supreme Court is being asked to determine what the temporal cutoff is for one of its decisions to become "clearly established Federal Law" under <a href="http://www.capdefnet.org/codes/28_usc_2254.htm">28 USC &#167; 2254(d)</a> [text], as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Petitioner Eric Greene was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in a robbery of a convenience store in which the store's owner was shot and killed. At the trial, Greene had objected to the admission of confessions of his conspirators and co-defendants on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag6_user.html">Confrontation Clause</a> [Sixth Amendment text] grounds. The court allowed the confessions with Greene's name redacted. He renewed this objection on appeal, arguing on the grounds of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="casename">Gray v. Maryland</span>. Gray was decided before Greene's conviction became final but after the state court's last decision on the merits. Greene argues that whether the <span class="casename">Gray</span> case should apply will be outcome determinative of his appeal. The Third Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CA3-Opinion-Greene.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that an opinion issued after a decision on the merits in state court is not "clearly established Federal Law," acknowledging that its decision created a circuit split. </p>

<p>The court also denied <em>certiorari</em> in three  Guantanamo detainee cases, allowing the decisions of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] to stand. The court did not act in a case involving the <a href="/currentawareness/uighurs.php">Uighurs</a> [JURIST news archives], a group of Chinese Muslims captured in Afghanistan. The Uighurs claim they were wrongfully captured and have attempted to challenge their indefinite detention. Some are still being held at Guantanamo since being captured in 2001. Of the 22 Uighurs originally detained at Guantanamo Bay, 17 have been relocated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pinholster</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arbitration-death-penalty-cases.php">report</a>] that review under the federal <em>habeas</em> law is limited to the record that was before the state court, reinstating the death penalty for a convicted man. The court's ruling reversed an <em>en banc</em> decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that the evidentiary hearing before a federal <em>habeas</em> court was not barred by section 2254(e)(2) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, <a href="http://www.capdefnet.org/codes/28_usc_2254.htm">28 USC &#167; 2254</a> [text]. Based on its holding, the appeals court then considered new evidence adduced during the evidentiary hearing and ultimately concluded that the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in denying Scott Pinholster's state <em>habeas</em> petition. In reviewing the Ninth Circuit's decision, the Supreme Court first considered whether review under &#167; 2254(d)(1) permits consideration of evidence introduced in an evidentiary hearing before the federal <em>habeas</em> court. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, stated:<blockquote>We now hold that review under &#167; 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the past tense, to a state-court adjudication that resulted in a decision that was "contrary to", or "involved" an unreasonable application of, established law. This backward looking language requires an examination of the state court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the record under review is limited to the record in existence at that same time&#8212;i.e., the record before the state court. This understanding of the text is compelled by "the broader context of the statute as a whole," which demonstrates Congress' intent to channel prisoners claims first to the state courts.</blockquote>The court then went on to consider whether the Ninth Circuit properly granted Pinholster <em>habeas</em> relief on his claim of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel. Holding that this decision was also in error, Thomas wrote, "[b]ecause Pinholster has failed to demonstrate that the adjudication of his claim based on the state-court record resulted in a decision "contrary to" or "involv[ing] an unreasonable application" of federal law, a writ of habeas corpus "shall not be granted" and our analysis is at an end." Justice Samuel Alito filed a separate opinion, concurring in part and concurring the in judgment. Justice Stephen Breyer also filed a separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan joined in part. In her opinion, Sotomayor disagreed with the court's restrictive interpretation of &#167; 2254(d)(1), arguing that it will result in "federal courts [turning] a blind eye to new evidence in deciding whether a petitioner has satisfied &#167; 2254(d)(1)'s threshold obstacle to federal habeas relief "even when it is clear that the petitioner would be entitled to relief in light of that evidence."

<p>Pinholster was convicted of the 1982 killing of two men during a burglary in Los Angeles. During the guilt phase of his trial, Pinholster rejected assistance from attorneys and insisted on representing himself. However, after being informed that the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence during the penalty phase to support a sentence of death, Pinholster accepted the trial court's appointment of two attorneys to his case. Pinholster's attorneys moved to exclude aggravating evidence on the ground that the prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence to be introduced, but it was later discovered that Pinholster, while representing himself, had in fact received notice and had denied the motion to exclude. The same jury that had convicted Pinholster in the earlier guilt phase of the trial sat for the penalty phase and voted unanimously for death. The California Supreme Court affirmed and subsequently denied two <em>habeas</em> petitions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Winn</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-takes-up-arizona-school-tuition-case.php">report</a>] that respondents lacked standing to bring suit regarding the constitutionality of an Arizona tax credit. The <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/ars/43/01089.htm">tax credit</a> [Ariz Rev Stat Ann &#167; 43-1089 text] applies to donations given to organizations that provide scholarships at private schools, many of which have religious affiliations. The taxpayers who brought suit argued that the tax credit program violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] because it unconstitutionally endorses or advances religion by incentivizing individuals to direct more contributions to religious organizations. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/04/21/0515754.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the taxpayers had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the law and allowed the claim to proceed. In an opinion authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court determined that respondents lacked standing based on its decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/392/83/case.html">Flast v. Cohen</a> [opinion text] because they were challenging a tax credit as opposed to a governmental expenditure. Kennedy also emphasized the importance of the concept of standing:
<blockquote>In an era of frequent litigation, class actions, sweeping injunctions with prospective effect, and continuing jurisdiction to enforce judicial remedies, courts must be more careful to insist on the formal rules of standing, not less so. Making the Article III standing inquiry all the more necessary are the significant implications of constitutional litigation, which can result in rules of wide applicability that are beyond Congress' power to change. The present suit serves as an illustration of these principles.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurring opinion in which Justice Clarence Thomas joined that referred to <span class="casename">Flast</span> as "an anomaly" and stated that the majority opinion did not need to consider the case and should have denied standing based on pure Constitutional grounds. Justice Elena Kagan wrote a dissent in which she was joined by three other justices that criticized the majority for creating a distinction between tax credits and government expenditures and stated that the law still financed religious activity.

<p>Before the tax credit law went into effect, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/23/pdf1999/cv970412.pdf">Kotterman v. Killian</a> [opinion, PDF] that, based on the construction of the statute, it did not on its face violate the Establishment Clause or provisions of the Arizona state constitution. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled In <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-157.ZO.html">Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation</a> [opinion text] that <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/supreme-court-rules-in-student-free.php">taxpayers do not have standing</a> [JURIST report] to challenge executive branch actions under the Establishment Clause. The Freedom from Religion Foundation  (FFR) filed a lawsuit over the use of government funds to promote then-president Bush's Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder, who wanted the accused be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report], referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US. Holder refused to delay the trial any longer for the sake of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families, explaining that the restrictions are not likely to be repealed in the immediate future. While deciding to proceed with military commissions, Holder defended the federal judiciary, saying:<blockquote>Too many people ... have expressed doubts about our time-honored and time-tested system of justice. That's not only misguided, it's wrong. The fact is, federal courts have proven to be an unparalleled instrument for bringing terrorists to justice. Our courts have convicted hundreds of terrorists since September 11, and our prisons safely and securely hold hundreds today, many of them serving long sentences. There is no other tool that has demonstrated the ability to both incapacitate terrorists and collect intelligence from them over such a diverse range of circumstances as our traditional justice system. Our national security demands that we continue to prosecute terrorists in federal court, and we will do so. Our heritage, our values, and our legacy to future generations also demand that we have full faith and confidence in a court system that has distinguished this nation throughout its history.</blockquote>Also on Monday, a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] granted prosecutors' <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Nolle_and_Unsealing_Order_-_4-4-11.pdf">motion to dismiss and unsealed the indictment</a> [text, PDF] of the co-conspirators, allowing the case to be transferred to the DOD. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] has spoken out <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/obama-administration-will-prosecute-911-suspects-broken-military-commissions-syste">against the administration's decision</a> [press release], saying that the military commissions system is "rife with constitutional and procedural problems and undermines the fundamental American values that have made us a model throughout the world for centuries."

<p>The Obama administration changed its position despite repeated appeals from rights groups to utilize civilian courts over military commissions for the trials of suspected terrorists. Last March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">hold civilian trials</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and other suspected terrorists saying that the military commissions system is fatally flawed and cannot be reformed. Earlier that month, the ACLU released a full-page advertisement in the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">urging President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] to uphold his pledge to try 9/11 suspects in civilian criminal court. That release came just days after White House advisers announced they were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. In an interview last July, Holder stated that the main goal of the administration is to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/holder-confirms-no-final-decision-on-trial-venue-for-accused-911-conspirators.php">hold the people responsible</a> [JURIST report] for 9/11 accountable in the most effective way possible. Holder reiterated his support for <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">holding the trials in civilian courts</a> [JURIST report], saying that the criminal justice system has been proven an effective location for terrorism trials and that excluding civilian courts as a possible tool in fighting terrorism would ultimately weaken the nation's security. Holder announced in November 2009 that Mohammed would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in a civilian court</a> [JURIST report] in Manhattan, drawing intense criticism and leading the Obama administration to reconsider the decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In December 1982, Sosa and other members of an elite military unit known as the "kaibiles'" allegedly ransacked Dos Erres looking for stolen weapons and, in search of them, killed men, women and children. The Spanish court issued the arrest warrant on Friday via the <a href="http://www.interpol.int/">International Crime Police Organization</a> (Interpol) [official website]. Sosa is the ninth suspect sought under a 1999 lawsuit brought by Nobel Peace Prize laureate <a href="http://www.distinguishedwomen.com/biographies/menchu.html">Rigoberta Menchu</a> [DW backgrounder] for crimes and disappearances during the Guatemalan civil war. Because Sosa holds citizenship in both the the US and Canada, it is uncertain whether he will be extradited to the US or Spain. Guatemala is also vying for his arrest. 

<p>In spite of the lack of arrests made under the 1999 lawsuit, Guatemala has actively sought to punish those involved in crimes against humanity, corruption and disappearances. In October, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/former-guatemala-police-sentenced-to-40-years-with-evidence-from-rediscovered-archive.php">two former National Police were sentenced to 40 years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for the disappearance of student and union leader Fernando Garcia after he was shot and hospitalized in 1984. In August, the <a href="http://cicig.org/">International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website, in Spanish] announced that it had issued arrest warrants for former government officials including those for former interior minister Carlos Vielmann, former police director Erwin Sperissen and former prison director Alejandro Giammettei in relation to the<a href="/paperchase/2010/08/guatemala-corruption-commission-issues-arrest-warrants-for-former-officials.php"> extrajudicial killing of several inmates</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009, a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/guatemala-ex-colonel-sentenced-to.php">retired Guatemalan colonel was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 53 years in prison for his role in the disappearance of eight indigenous Guatemalans during the civil war. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court stressed that a prohibition on headscarves is in line with the schools interest in maintaining its Catholic character and held that the ban on headscarves does not constitute religious discrimination because hats and similar attire are also banned. The court chose to uphold the ban despite a <a href="http://www.cgb.nl/oordelen/oordeel/221530/katholieke_school_maakt_verboden_onderscheid_op_grond_van_godsdienst_jegens_leerling_door_hoofddoekverbod__beroep_op_de_wettelijke_uitzondering_voor_bijzonder_onderwijs_slaagt___">finding</a> [materials, in Dutch] by the country's <a href="http://www.cgb.nl/home">Equal Treatment Commission</a> (CGB) [official website, in Dutch] that the practice of banning headscarves amounts to religious discrimination. The suit originated when a student at Don Bosco filed a complaint with the CGB alleging that the schools practice of banning headscarves constituted religious discrimination. It is unclear whether the decision will be appealed. 

<p>Religious headscarves have been banned in schools in several European countries. In 2009, a <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/dutch-speaking-belgium-schools-to-ban.php">similar ban was instituted in all Dutch-speaking Belgium schools</a> [JURIST report] in the northern region of Flanders. In 2008, the Dutch government <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dutch-government-outlines-plan-to-ban.php">announced plans to ban burqas</a> [JURIST report] in schools. In that same year, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/index.htm">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-rules-france-school-could.php">unanimously ruled</a> [JURIST report] that there was no human rights violation when a French school expelled two students in 1999 for refusing to remove their headscarves. In 2004, France <a href="/paperchase/2004/03/french-headscarf-ban-will-take-effect.htm">banned religious clothing and symbols in public schools</a> [JURIST report]. A German court has <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/germany-state-court-upholds-teacher.php">upheld a similar ban</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court dismissed the appeal for improper timing because the challenged rulemaking document has yet to be published in the Federal Register and is not a licensing decision with respect to the specific parties as required by <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=d39f7aeae46dd7cf8efd166068b2334f&rgn=div8&view=text&node=47:1.0.1.1.2.1.147.4&idno=47">47 CFR &#167; 1.4(b)(1)</a> [text]. The court said it would be subject to judicial review once it is published in the Federal Register. Verizon spokesperson Ed McFadden said that the notices of appeal were filed because the FCC's <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/04/04/oukin-uk-usa-internet-rules-idUKTRE7335VH20110404?pageNumber=2">rules governing timing of appeals were unclear</a> [Reuters report] and the company did not want to lose its right to appeal. Verizon plans to file a second appeal when the rules are published in the Federal Register.    

<p><a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">Verizon</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/cell-phone-company-sues-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rules.php">MetroPCS</a> [JURIST reports] filed the challenges in January out of concern over the broad authority the new rules would grant the FCC. The FCC has long been trying to exert more control over Internet regulation. Last year, US <a href="http://demint.senate.gov/public/">Senator Jim DeMint</a> (R-SC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/senators-introduce-legislation-to-block-fcc-broadband-plan.php">introduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] intended to block the FCC from implementing its <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/">National Broadband Plan</a> [official website; <a href="http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/">materials</a>]. The Freedom for Consumer Choice Act would remove the FCC's ability to declare the actions of a communications provider illegal unless there was a clear showing that the practice causes harm to consumers and will not be corrected by market forces. A month earlier, the FCC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/FCC-opens-broadband-proceedings-to-determine-legal-approach-to-regulation.php">opened a new proceeding</a> [JURIST report] to identify the legal approach that will best support its efforts to develop universal access to "high quality" Internet broadband services. A previous court ruling found that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">FCC lacks the power to enforce net neutrality</a> [JURIST report]. Net neutrality is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/vietnam-rights-lawyer-jailed-after-calling-for-government-reform.php">convicted Vu</a> [JURIST report] on Monday, sentencing him to seven years in prison followed by three years of house arrest, on the basis of interviews given to international media in which Vu advocated an end to Vietnam's one-party system and other reforms. In their complaint, Vu's lawyers <a href="http://www.wqow.com/Global/story.asp?S=14383779">claim that the judge violated Vu's rights</a> [AP report] under Vietnamese law by not giving lawyers access to or reading for himself complete transcripts of the interviews. During the trial, one of the Vu's lawyers was ejected from the court for repeatedly asking the judge to read the full transcripts, and Vu's other three lawyers left in protest forcing Vu to defend himself. Last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/02/vietnam-release-prominent-legal-activist">called for the Vietnamese government to release Vu</a> [press release], calling him "one of the most prominent defenders of cultural, environmental and human rights in Vietnam," On Monday, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov">Department of State</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/04/159771.htm">expressed concerns</a> [press release] over Vu's conviction, saying it "runs counter to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and raises serious questions about Vietnam's commitment to rule of law and reform."

<p>Vu is among several dissidents in Vietnam who have been convicted for anti-government activity. In January, a Vietnamese court sentenced former communist official Vi Duc Hoi to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy-activist-convicted-of-violating-national-security.php">eight years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for advocating democracy and a multi-party system. In January 2010, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-sentences-democracy.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] writer and democracy activist Pham Thanh Nghien to four years in prison on charges of spreading anti-state propaganda. That same month, a Vietnamese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/vietnam-court-convicts-four-pro.php">convicted four democracy activists</a> [JURIST report] of subversion.

The OHCHR insisted that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/784383.stm">Yemen</a> [BBC profile] deliver on its promise to establish a commission to inquire into recent alleged government-led killings and abuses that occurred during protests, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-president-declares-state-of-emergency.php">those that took place in the capital of Sana'a</a> [JURIST report] in March and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/04/yemeni-troops-kill-protesters-taiz">in Taiz</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] yesterday. Forty-five protesters were <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/03/18/idINIndia-55698420110318">reportedly killed</a> [Reuters report] at the anti-government rally in Sana'a, and a reported 15 protesters were killed in Taiz. The OHCHR also called on the Yemeni government to halt the targeting of marginalized minority groups.

<p>The Yemeni Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">enacted several emergency measures</a> [JURIST report] in March at the request of <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic] in an effort to end anti-government protests. The new laws <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-23-yemen_N.htm">give the government greater power</a> [AP report] to arrest and detain protesters and to censor the media. Protests, largely organized by the Joint Meeting Party (JMP), have been ongoing in Yemen since February, largely calling for Saleh to step down. Saleh has been in power since 1978 and is considered popular in Yemen and the international community. However, he and his party, the General People's Congress (GPC) have caused mounting political tensions due to attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand their political power. In December, the parliament stoked outrage among opposition parties and independents when it <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipKDkB5w7UaeP0M9e8bZ1XdjZokQ?docId=CNG.9eab6633bebd069b5f0a3ec51e79b6e5.b51">amended the constitution</a> [AFP report] to eliminate provisions requiring that opposition parties be represented on the high election commission. Although the government has maintained control in urban areas, the northern and southern parts of the country remain unlawful and dangerous, plagued by southern separatists groups and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive].

Kenyan authorities last week emphasized that "the ICC's jurisdiction [is] <em>complementary</em> to national criminal jurisdictions" and argued that, with its new constitution and reformed judicial system, Kenyan officials are capable of prosecuting the cases domestically:<blockquote>The adoption of the new Constitution and associated reforms has opened the way for Kenya to conduct its own prosecutions in Kenya for the post-election violence in respect of persons at the highest levels of authority and for the most serious crimes...The recent and current initiatives have all been designed and adopted to cure problems, or shortcomings, of the past. They demonstrate that the time is ripe for Kenya to exercise jurisdiction which the ICC should yield.</blockquote>The ICC on Monday announced that its judges will <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/pre_trial%20chamber%20ii%20receives%20application%20from%20kenyan%20government">review Kenya's motion</a> [press release], but that under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [official website], the judges are not required to reach a decision within any specific period of time. The trial will continue while the motion is under review, with the accused leaders <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/12/531.TGFuZz1FTg.html">scheduled to appear</a> [HJP report] before the court next week.

<p>In December, ICC <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] identified the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">six suspects</a> [JURIST report], including current Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta and several Ministry heads. All six are believed to have fomented violence, rape and destruction of property during the 30 days of post-election violence, but they have not yet been charged in Kenya for the alleged crimes. Last month, Moreno-Ocampo warned the six Kenyan suspects that arrests would ensue if they did <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-warns-kenya-suspects-will-be-arrested-if-court-rules-not-followed.php">not comply with the court's conditions</a> [JURIST report]. The warning followed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summons</a> [JURIST report] issued by the ICC earlier that month for the suspects to appear before the court on April 7 for an initial hearing. The Kenyan government also announced last month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/kenya-to-challenge-icc-summons.php">challenge the admissibility of cases</a> [JURIST report] relating to the post-election violence in the ICC, as well as the jurisdiction of the court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The FAC officially <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.bvger.ch/%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D620%26prmd%3Divns&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=de&twu=1&u=http://www.bvger.ch/index.html%3Flang%3Dde%26download%3DNHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDdIR5gmym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A--&usg=ALkJrhiGVLIbpbs4fhpfS-6ZUpxxAIqv5Q">ruled on the claim</a> [media release] brought by the <a href="http://www.edoeb.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en">Swiss Data Protection Ombudsman and Public Domain</a> (FDPIC) [official website] against Google on March 30. According to the judgment, before publishing any pictures on the web, Google must make all faces and license plates unrecognizable as well as ensure the anonymity of individuals in the vicinity of sensitive facilities. In making its decision to impose restrictions on Google's Street View, the FAC considered the interests of the public in having a visual record and the commercial interests of the defendants, but ultimately determined that these did not outweigh the rights an individual has over one's own image. Google now has the opportunity to appeal the decision to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. The FDPIC originally brought the claim in November 2009.

<p>Google has recently faced a number of allegations from the international community related to violating privacy laws by capturing personal data through Google Street View. Just last month, A Berlin high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Google's Street View mapping service is legal in Germany. The case stems from a suit against Google, brought last year by a woman alleging that photos posted on Google Street View of herself, her family and the front of her house violated her property and privacy rights. The court held that, because the photos were taken from the street, Google did not violate her property rights. Furthermore, the court found no further violations because Germans can opt out of the service, and Google blurs faces and license plates in the posted images. The ruling, which cannot be appealed, was narrowly focused on property rights, ignoring larger data protection issues the company is currently confronting. Additionally in March, the <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/">French National Commission of Information Technology and Liberty</a> (CNIL) [official website, in French] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-commission-fines-google-for-violating-data-privacy-laws.php">fined Google</a> [JURIST report] 100,000 euros (USD $141,300) for violating French data privacy laws by capturing personal data through Google Street View cars, used for its Google Maps service. CNIL stated that Google was not responding to requests in a timely manner and has not stopped using the seized data. Google admitted to the collection of e-mails, passwords and other data over unsecured WiFi networks, but maintained that it was a mistake and that it did not intend to include the code which captured payload data from unsecured WiFi networks. In response to the controversy, Google grounded its Street View cars. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo said that his office is <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/85A578D5-946A-44C3-9908-1C2243062EF0.htm">"concerned"</a> [press release] with recent reports of 1,500 casualties during the struggle to force <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2710391.stm">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] to cede power but conceded that the office does not have strong enough evidence to proceed:

<p>The Ivory Coast is a member of the <a href = "http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] which established the ICC, and other member states can refer a country's conduct for scrutiny by the court. Moreno-Ocampo said that this would be helpful in allowing his office's investigation to proceed and discussed a possible a referral from the <a href = "http://www.ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> (ECOWAS) [official website], which counts the Ivory Coast as a member. ECOWAS issued a <a href = "http://news.ecowas.int/presseshow.php?nb=051&lang=en&annee=2011">statement</a> [text] on Tuesday "to express its horror at the reported massacre" in the Ivory Coast and "the use of unarmed civilians as human shield in areas of conflict." The ICC's profile on the <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Comm+and+Ref/C%C3%B4te+dIvoire/">Ivory Coast</a> [ICC profile] does not contain recent allegations, but the <a href = "http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/">Office of the Prosecutor</a> [official website] lists the investigation as pending. It is reported that Gbagbo is <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-ivorycoast-idUSTRE73014Z20110406">attempting to leave the country</a> [Reuters report] and has instructed his forces to <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38014&Cr=ivoire&Cr1=">quit fighting</a> [UN News Centre report].</p>

<p>Last week, the <a href = "http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence that took place. Earlier, the UN <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-restraint-caution-in-ivory-coast.php">urged all parties in the Ivory Coast to show restraint</a> [JURIST report]. A spokesperson acknowledged unconfirmed reports that the Ivory Coast Republican Forces had "engaged in looting and extortion as well as serious human rights violations such as abductions, arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment of civilians" during their advance towards the country's capital of Abidjan. Last month, the OHCHR called for an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">independent investigation into post-election violence</a> [JURIST report]. In January, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/un-warns-of-possible-ivory-coast-genocide.php">UN officials expressed "grave concerns"</a> [JURIST report] regarding the post-election violence, cautioning that genocide could be imminent. In February, Gbagbo <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/ivory-coast-president-dissolves.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the country's parliament and electoral commission based on allegations of voter fraud in the long delayed presidential elections. On disbanding the government, Gbagbo charged <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793729.stm">Prime Minister Guillaume Soro</a> [BBC profile] with creation of new government and new election format. The violence stems from Gbagbo's refusal to cede power to president-elect Alassane Ouattara, who won the November 2010 runoff election according to international observers. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 to serve a five-year term, but he has managed to stay in office, delaying six successive elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/wpcap.htm">Court of Appeals of Virginia</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opncavwp/0521094.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a conviction where police officers used a GPS device to track the movement of a suspect in a string of sexual assaults without obtaining a warrant. The state's second highest appellate court failed to address whether the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] generally requires a warrant in such a situation, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/full-va-appeals-court-affirms-police-use-of-gps-to-track-sex-offender-whos-later-arrested/2011/04/05/AFJGmljC_story.html">ruling on narrower grounds</a> [AP report] that the police would have had access to the same evidence they used to convict the suspect without the GPS device and thus the evidence of sexual assault was excepted from the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree">fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The suspect, David Foltz, was on probation for sexual assault and became a suspect after police noticed a strong similarity between assaults occurring at the time and those previously committed by Foltz. Foltz's only mode of transportation was a work van provided by his employer which Foltz was supposed to use only for work and probation-related meetings. The employer's records showed the van had been near the location of each recent assault. Officers then placed a tracking device on the van and tracked it to the location of a subsequent assault. Finally, police physically followed Foltz as he drove the van and arrested him as he attempted to assault another woman which led to the conviction upheld Tuesday. The court reasoned:<blockquote>The assault the officers observed was a new and distinct offense from the previously committed crimes the officers were investigating, and sufficiently independent of any information obtained by them from the GPS tracking device. The officers' focus on appellant, a registered sex offender on probation, as the likely perpetrator of the recent sexual assaults did not begin with the placement of the GPS device on his assigned work van. They knew that appellant resided, worked, and attended probation-related meetings where the recent assaults occurred. They knew that the manner in which the perpetrator of the recent sexual assaults attacked those victims was "amazingly like" that appellant used in previous sexual assaults to which he had previously confessed. The additional information obtained from the GPS tracking of the van's locations near the scene of the latest attack was just one more piece of information to add to the already strong focus on appellant as the person responsible for the assaults. * * * We hold that the officers' observations of that criminal act were sufficiently attenuated from any argued taint arising from the placement and use of the GPS device to track the movements of appellant's assigned work van and that there is no basis in law to exclude the officers' eyewitness testimony of a violent assault being committed in their presence."</blockquote>Two judges filed a concurring opinion, arguing that the court should address the Fourth Amendment issues raised in the case and concluding that did Foltz did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his employer's van that he was allowed to use only for limited purposes, especially since officers placed the GPS device on the van's bumper while it was parked on a public street. Tuesday's ruling upheld a <a href="http://webservices.lexisnexis.com/lx1/caselaw/freecaselaw?action=OCLGetCaseDetail&format=FULL&sourceID=bdjcca&searchTerm=faZN.OdSb.gfcS.Kaaa&searchFlag=y&l1loc=FCLOW">decision</a> [opinion] by a three-judge panel from the Court of Appeals of Virginia last year which held that placing the GPS on the employer's van did not violate Foltz's Fourth Amendment rights.

<p>The use of GPS technology and other <a href="/currentawareness/surveillance.php">surveillance devices</a> [JURIST news archive] by law enforcement agents has been a controversial issue in the US, with courts across the country coming to divergent conclusions. In December, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-appeals-court-allows-ruling-against-warrantless-gps-tracking-to-stand.php">declined to rehear <em>en banc</em></a> [JURIST report] a bid by the DOJ to overturn a decision that prevents the government from using GPS technology to track suspects without a warrant. A Pennsylvania appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/pennsylvania-appeals-court-allows-evidence-obtained-with-gps-technology.php">allowed use of evidence obtained with GPS technology</a> [JURIST report] in December. In September, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084227p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that at times the government <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/third-circuit-rules-warrant-may-be-required-to-collect-cell-phone-location-data.php">might need a warrant to obtain cell phone data</a> [JURIST report] to track a person's location. Last year, the US Supreme Court unanimously held that, even if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in work-issued electronic devices, that an <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">employermsearch of private text messages does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Fourth Amendment so long as the search is not excessive and is pursuant to a legitimate work-related purpose. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report chronicles reports of beatings and use of excessive force by security forces including shootings of peaceful protesters. AI criticizes the response of authorities to the mounting death tolls as woefully inadequate. While investigations have been announced, they are being conducted by governmental bodies that do not have a mandate to carry out the judicial investigations and they are not likely to be successful. The report also alleges that security forces have used US-made tear gas and rubber grenades to violently repress the protesters. AI recommends that the international community provide Yemeni authorities with the support necessary for an effective and independent investigation into the human rights violations, suspend the supply and transfer of weapons that could be used for excessive force and ensure that the military and security support given to Yemen adheres to international human rights standards. The protests which have been fueled by frustration at corruption, unemployment and repression of freedoms have resulted in 94 deaths. 

<p>On Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-yemen-to-halt-use-of-force-against-protesters.php">urged the Yemeni government</a> [JURIST report] to discontinue using force against peaceful protesters. The Yemeni Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">enacted several emergency measures</a> [JURIST report] in March at the request of <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic] in an effort to end anti-government protests. The new laws <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-23-yemen_N.htm">give the government greater power</a> [AP report] to arrest and detain protesters and to censor the media. Protests, largely organized by the Joint Meeting Party (JMP), have been ongoing in Yemen since February, largely calling for Saleh to step down. Saleh has been in power since 1978 and is considered popular in Yemen and the international community. However, he and his party, the General People's Congress (GPC), have caused mounting political tensions due to attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand their political power. In December, the parliament stoked outrage among opposition parties and independents when it <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipKDkB5w7UaeP0M9e8bZ1XdjZokQ?docId=CNG.9eab6633bebd069b5f0a3ec51e79b6e5.b51">amended the constitution</a> [AFP report] to eliminate provisions requiring that opposition parties be represented on the high election commission. Although the government has maintained control in urban areas, the northern and southern parts of the country remain unlawful and dangerous, plagued by southern separatists groups and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. The protests in Yemen have been analyzed in two recent JURIST op-eds: <a href="/forum/2011/01/dnp-popular-enforcement-of-constitutions-in-tunisia-yemen-and-egypt.php">Constitutional Enforcement in Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt</a> by <a href="http://www.washburnlaw.edu/faculty/khan-ali.php">L.

The "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act" is based on disputed medical evidence suggesting that a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/05/us-abortion-idaho-idUSTRE7347EL20110405">fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks</a> [Reuters report], and would permit abortions after that time period only in cases where the mother's life is at risk or she faces serious injury. A doctor who performs an abortion in violation of the time limit would be subject to criminal prosecution for a felony, but there would be no penalty for the woman undergoing the procedure. The bill includes additional provisions allowing civil suits to be filed for "actual damages" against the doctor performing the procedure by a woman upon whom an abortion is attempted or performed, or by the father of the unborn child if an abortion is performed. Also made available by the bill as "civil remedies" are injunctions which can be sought by a range of parties:<blockquote>A cause of action for injunctive relief . . . may be maintained by the woman upon whom an abortion was performed or attempted to be performed in violation of the provisions of this chapter, by any person who is the spouse, parent, sibling, or guardian of, or a current or former licensed health care provider of the woman . . ., by a prosecuting attorney with appropriate jurisdiction, or by the attorney general.</blockquote>Regardless, there can be no damages assessed against the woman undergoing the procedure. Idaho <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/">Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter</a> [official website] is expected to sign the approved legislation into law.

<p>Since the November elections state legislatures across the country have been implementing measures to restrict abortions. Last week, the <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit doctors from performing late-term abortions in the state. Last month, the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/">Kansas Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/idaho-kansas-lawmakers-approve-bans-on-late-term-abortions.php">approved legislation</a> restricting late-term abortions, after the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved the measure</a> [JURIST reports] in February. Also last month, South Dakota <a href="http://www.sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and  wait three days before obtaining an abortion. The <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/">Missouri House of Representatives</a> [official website] in March voted in favor of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">restricting late-term abortions</a> [JURIST report] and imposing penalties on doctors who fail to comply with the new restrictions. The legislation, which is slated to become effective at the end of August, bans abortions of "viable" fetuses. The <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/">Oklahoma House of Representatives</a> [official website] also voted in March to approve a bill that would ban abortion <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">after 20 weeks of gestation</a> [JURIST report]. <br />

Berlusconi and Moroccan-born teenager Karima El Mahroug, known as Ruby, did not attend the trial. Berlusconi <a href="http://www.wpix.com/news/sns-rt-international-us-ittre73453y-20110405,0,6332794.story?track=rss">faces charges</a> [Reuters] for abusing the power of his office and allegedly offering cash and jewels in exchange for sex with the 17-year-old Ruby, who is under the legal age of prostitution in Italy. In addition to the payments, Berlusconi also allegedly called police to secure Ruby's release while she was detained on an unrelated suspicion of theft. Both Ruby and Berlusconi maintain that the two never had sex, and Berlusconi denies the charges against him. Critics and supporters <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/COGRA/f29d8dad34bd498da777a4fb9802979d/Article_2011-04-06-EU-Italy-Berlusconi-Trial/id-eaf8153db20341ee8b82345c66028de2">gathered outside the court</a> [AP report] as the trial commenced.  Berlusconi's trial is scheduled to resume on May 31.  

<p>Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">Berlusconi attended a hearing in Milan</a> [JURIST report] to defend himself against charges of fraud and embezzlement. Prior to that hearing, Berlusconi had not attended a case hearing for more than seven years. In February, an Italian <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">judge ordered Berlusconi to stand trial </a> [JURIST report] on the current charges of paying for sex with a minor and abuse of power.

The bill will become effective 90 days after the close of the current legislative session.  

<p>In January, the <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/lsoweb/">Wyoming House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2011/Bills/HB0074.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/wyoming-legislature-approves-bill-rejecting-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">prevent Wyoming from recognizing</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriages and civil unions performed out-of-state.

The bill, approved by a vote of 73-28, would grant state and local police broad powers to examine the immigration status of anyone detained, no matter what the charge. The bill also denies state services to illegal immigrants and requires businesses to check employees' immigration statuses through the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] database. The legislation <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-immigration-alabama-idUSTRE73509R20110406">met opposition</a> [Reuters report] from Democrats, who claim that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government and the additional crackdown would place pressure on Alabama's already strained budget. Civil rights groups remain concerned that the legislation would lead to racial profiling in a state with a sordid history of civil rights violations. The bill will now move to the <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/senate/senate.html">Alabama Senate</a> [official website] for a vote.

<p>Several states have <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed legislation</a> [JURIST reports] similar to the controversial Arizona immigration law. Last month, the <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/">Oklahoma State Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would give police officers the authority to question the citizenship status of any person lawfully stopped for a traffic violation and arrest them without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally. Also in March, <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Utah Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a package of bills aimed at both reforming the state's immigration laws and challenging the federal government to take action for reform nationally. In February, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require individuals suspected of being illegal to provide proof of their legal status and calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in July against <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Arizona Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin the state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The Arizona law criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. It has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court, however, went on to vacate the original sentence against Skilling and remand for resentencing due to lower court error. The appeals court said:<blockquote>[The] five fraudulent schemes, which formed a large part of the basis for the Government's proof at trial, all represent efforts by Skilling and his coconspirators to manipulate Enron's reported earnings or conceal Enron's losses from the investing public with the intent and result of affecting Enron's stock price. Because they are supported by overwhelming evidence, we find that the honest-services instruction was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>The court also said that the <a href="http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/pinkerton-charge/">Pinkerton instruction</a> [USLegal backgrounder] given to the jury was harmless error, and, therefore, Skilling "has no basis on which to challenge the remaining convictions." Skilling's lawyer has said he will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12994573">continue efforts to overturn</a> [BBC report] Skilling's convictions. 

<p>In June, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1394.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1394">Skilling v. United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001346----000-.html">"honest services" doctrine</a> [18 USC &#167; 1346 text] is <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-holds-publicity-did-not-prevent-fair-trial-in-enron-case.php">not unconstitutionally vague</a> [JURIST report] under a limited construction of the statute and that the district court adequately "detected and diffused" juror prejudice in the pre-trial publicity of Skilling. In February 2009, the Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/fifth-circuit-denies-enron-ex-ceo.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a petition for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing for Skilling after a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fifth-circuit-upholds-convictions-of.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] his previous convictions and ordered him to be resentenced due to error in the lower court. Skilling's appeal was based on a previous Fifth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-overturns.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that overturned convictions for other Enron executives based on "honest services theft" because they had acted in Enron's best interest by direction and did not profit from their actions. The panel ruled that Skilling's case differed from these previous rulings because "no one at Enron sanctioned Skilling's improper conduct" and because Skilling's compensation structure was aligned with Enron's earnings. In 2006, Skilling was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/breaking-news-jury-finds-lay-skilling.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of 19 counts of conspiracy, insider trading and securities fraud. He is currently serving a 24-year sentence. Skilling initially <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/enron-ex-ceo-skilling-appeals.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] his conviction in September 2007 claiming prosecutorial and judicial errors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontantiabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohiosenate.gov/">Ohio Senate</a> [official website] on Wednesday approved a <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_SB_72_PS_Y.pdf">bill</a> [SB 72 text, PDF] that would limit the availability of <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive] after 20 weeks. The act, which was approved 24-8 by the Republican-dominated assembly, requires doctors to determine the viability of the fetus and seek a second opinion as to whether the child is capable of surviving outside of the womb. In the event that the fetus is viable, an abortion would only be made available if the woman faced "death or a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function." The Senate bill comes little more than a month after a legislative committee in the <a href="http://www.house.state.oh.us/">Ohio House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/03/30/abortion-bill-may-get-house-committee-vote-today.html?sid=101">advanced</a> [<em>Columbus Dispatch</em> report] the "<a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_HB_125_RH_Y.pdf">Heartbeat Bill</a>," [HB 125 text], which would ban abortions after the point at which a fetus's heartbeat becomes detectable in the womb. <a href="http://www.ohiolife.org/">Ohio Right to Life</a> [advocacy website], which strongly supports the Senate bill, has opposed the Heartbeat Bill on the grounds that it is likely to be overturned by courts due to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZO.html">Roe v. Wade</a> [opinion text]. 

<p>Ohio's Senate bill is part of a wave of acts passed by state legislatures since the November elections aimed at restricting abortions in the wake of disputed medical evidence that suggests that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/05/us-abortion-idaho-idUSTRE7347EL20110405">fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks</a> [Reuters report]. On Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/">Idaho legislature</a> [official website] gave final approval to a <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1165.pdf">bill</a> [SB 1165 text, PDF] that would prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks. Last week, the <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit doctors from performing late-term abortions in the state. Last month, the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/">Kansas Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/idaho-kansas-lawmakers-approve-bans-on-late-term-abortions.php">approved legislation</a> restricting late-term abortions, after the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved the measure</a> [JURIST reports] in February. Also last month, South Dakota <a href="http://www.sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. The <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/">Missouri House of Representatives</a> [official website] in March voted in favor of legislation <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">restricting late-term abortions</a> [JURIST report] and imposing penalties on doctors who fail to comply with the new restrictions. The legislation, which is slated to become effective at the end of August, bans abortions of "viable" fetuses. The <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/">Oklahoma House of Representatives</a> [official website] also voted in March to approve a bill that would ban abortion <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">after 20 weeks of gestation</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The AI report alleges that Roma living in these informal settlements, approximately one-third of the Belgrade Roma population, are denied access to water, sanitation and other basic services "that are vital to human rights&#8212;including education, health, social insurance and employment." Approximately 17 percent of the Roma population in Serbia fled the <a href="http://www.balkandevelopment.org/edu_kos.html">1999 war in Kosovo</a> [CBD backgrounder], and the report states that these people have no choice but to live in informal settlements. The report further contends that a majority of the evictions result from projects funded by the <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pages/homepage.shtml">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a> (EBRD) and the <a href="http://www.eib.org/index.htm">European Investment Bank</a> (EIB) [official websites]. AI alleges that, as a party to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cescr.htm">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> (ICESCR) [text], Serbia is in violation of its obligation to protect and provide adequate housing:<blockquote>Amnesty International considers that the Serbian government has failed to comply with its obligations under international and regional human rights treaties to prohibit, prevent and end forced evictions. These forced evictions have primarily affected Roma communities living in informal settlements, one of the most marginalized communities in Serbia. ...

<p>The Roma have faced <a href="/hotline/2010/11/roma-students-face-lasting-repercussions-from-discrimination.php">discrimination</a> [JURIST comment] throughout Europe. In March, AI released a similar report alleging <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-slovenia-to-pretect-roma-migrant-communities.php">rights violations against Roma in Slovenia</a> [JURIST report]. In November, rights groups <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a>, <a href="http://www.errc.org/">European Roma Rights Centre</a> and <a href="http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/bhr/english/index.html">Greek Helsinki Monitor</a> [advocacy websites] issued a <a href="http://www.errc.org/cms/upload/file/fourth-communication-to-the-committee-of-ministers-on-judgment-implementation-30112010.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] alleging that the Czech government had <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/human-rights-groups-file-complaint-with-eu-condemning-czech-republics-treatment-of-roma-children.php">failed to comply</a> [JURIST report] with a <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/echr-rules-against-separate-schooling.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] which determined that the Czech Republic government was discriminating against Roma children. In October, the <a href="http://www.ldh-france.org/">League of Human Rights</a> [advocacy website, in French] accused the French government of <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-claims-france-police-illegally-collecting-roma-dna.php">improperly collecting DNA samples</a> [JURIST report] from Roma that had not been either arrested or charged with a crime.

US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] officials say Jama Idle Ibrahim, who <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/Press_Releases/2010%20Archives/September/10-224.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [press release, PDF] last year to conspiracy to commit piracy and conspiracy to use a firearm during a violent crime, and other Somali men were armed with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades when they seized the Danish vessel M/V CEC Future and held its 13-member crew for ransom. Ibrahim's sentence will run concurrent with the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-30-years.php">30-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] he received in November, stemming from a failed assault on the Navy's USS Ashland.  

<p>In November, a federal jury in Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] five Somali men on charges of piracy for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nichols. In August, piracy charges against Ibrahim and five other defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court affirmed the decision of the <a href="http://www.co.pulaski.ar.us/districtcourt.shtml">Pulaski County Circuit Court</a> [official website] invalidating <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/cole-v-arkansas-case-profile">Act 1</a> [ACLU backgrounder], a state law which prohibits all unmarried couples from adopting or fostering children in the state. The court held that the "fundamental privacy rights, which are implicit in the Arkansas Constitution, are substantially and directly burdened by Act 1's prohibition against the ability of cohabiting sexual partners to foster or adopt children." The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which brought the suit on behalf of 20 individuals claiming the law unfairly discriminated against them, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down-parenting-ban-contrary-children-s-welfare">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release], calling it "a relief for the over 1,600 children in the state of Arkansas who need a permanent family."

<p>The original suit was filed after the law was criticized for effectively denying all gay couples the right to adopt or foster a child because Arkansas does not recognize gay marriage. The lower court made its <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arkansas-judge-strikes-down-gay.php">decision to strike down</a> Act 1 last year after the law was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed by ballot initiative</a> in November 2008 following <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/arkansas-ballot-to-contain-proposed-ban.php">certification</a> [JURIST reports] the previous August. The measure followed a 2006 Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/arkansas-ballot-to-contain-proposed-ban.php">decision</a> [text, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/arkansas-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down an administrative regulation</a> [JURIST report] specifically prohibiting homosexuals from rearing foster children. Reacting to that decision, then-governor Mike Huckabee suggested that such a ban be <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/arkansas-governor-wants-legislation.php">implemented through legislation</a> [JURIST report]. Arkansas, like many states, has amended its constitution to prohibit the recognition of <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Facing charges including murder, deportation, rape, inhumane acts, persecution and torture, the two suspended government ministers and one radio executive denied the allegations of stirring up ethnic hatred that left at least 1,200 people dead and half a million others forced from their homes. The three men are half of the group being called the Ocampo Six that allegedly orchestrated the violence, with the remaining three men facing similar proceedings in the ICC on Friday. The ICC has divided the group according to political allegiances, since the men are accused of fomenting violence from each side of the unrest that resulted after supporters of President Mwai Kibaki were accused of rigging the 2007 election. The violence ended when Kibaki and his rival Raila Odinga agreed to share power by making Odinga prime minister, and to prosecute perpetrators of the violence either in Kenya or The Hague.

<p>Last week, Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">submitted requests</a> [JURIST report] to the ICC to <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/ICC/Kenya/Pros.%20v.%20Ruto,%20Kosgey,%20Sang%20et%20al%20APPLICATION%20BY%20KENYA.pdf">dismiss the cases</a> [motion, PDF] against the six Kenyans. Kenyan authorities emphasized that "the ICC's jurisdiction [is] <em>complementary</em> to national criminal jurisdictions" and argued that, with its new constitution and reformed judicial system, Kenyan officials are capable of prosecuting the cases domestically. However, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summoned the six suspects</a> [JURIST report] last month after determining that Kenyan authorities had failed to try the cases at home. On Thursday, presiding judge Ekaterina Trendafilova echoed earlier warnings by ICC <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile]  to the six Kenyan suspects that the summonses would be altered and arrests would ensue if they did <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-warns-kenya-suspects-will-be-arrested-if-court-rules-not-followed.php">not comply</a> [JURIST report] with the court's conditions, including prohibitions on speeches that may incite more bloodshed in Kenya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The probe has resulted hundreds of arrests, with people awaiting or on trial, but has not yet delivered any verdicts. Among the hundreds arrested are 163 active and retired military officers. On Wednesday, the <a href = "http://www.tsk.tr/">Turkish Armed Forces</a> (TAF) [official website, in Turkish] <a href = "http://www.tsk.tr/10_ARSIV/10_1_Basin_Yayin_Faaliyetleri/10_1_Basin_Aciklamalari/2011/BA_05.htm">criticized</a> [press release, in Turkish] the slow pace of the trials and exonerating evidence being ignored. Several officers have been jailed due to their connection to a military seminar conducted at the time of the coup, which the TAF contends was unrelated:<blockquote>The Turkish Armed Forces, which has avoided involvement in any action which would be interpreted as an intervention in an ongoing judicial process, has repeatedly explained what that seminar is, what it included and who joined the seminar with which instruction by delivering statements and informing the related authorities in a way so as not to affect the judiciary. ... While the picture is like this, it is hard to understand the continued detention of 163 active and retired Turkish Armed Forces personnel.</blockquote>Representatives of the ruling <a href = "http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website] and the <a href = "http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/">Grand National Assembly</a> [official website, in Turkish] were <a href = "http://ca.news.yahoo.com/turkey-replaces-prosecutors-probing-alleged-coup-plot-amid-20110407-031531-565.html">displeased</a> [AP report] with the TAF's comment. The prosecutor switch was announced a month ago, a rumored reaction to recent arrests of journalists in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/turkish-authorities-jail-journalists-over-alleged-coup-plot-ties.php">February</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/turkish-authorities-arrest-more-journalists-over-alleged-coup-plot-ties.php">March</a> that have caused a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-urges-turkish-government-to-respect-freedom-of-expression.php">UN rebuke</a> [JURIST reports]. Turkey's detention of journalists was analyzed in the JURIST op-ed <a href = "/hotline/2011/04/justice-must-be-brought-to-turkish-journalists.php">Justice Must be Brought to Turkish Journalists</a>.

<p>Trials of military and naval officials have been ongoing since <A href = "/paperchase/2010/12/turkish-court-opens-landmark-coup-trial.php">December 2010</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/turkish-court-begins-trial-in-ergenekon-coup-plot.php">June 2009</a>, while detainment and trial of some suspects has been <a href = "/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">continuous since 2008</a> [JURIST reports]. Suspects are accused of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule in another plot planned by a group called Ergenekon. The group allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the AKP. Prosecutors in the case will attempt to link defendants to a plan to detonate a bomb in an Istanbul museum and the deaths of a Catholic priest, Protestant missionaries and journalist Hrant Dink. The investigations have strained relations between the religiously-inclined government and the secular military, which has been responsible for four coups in the last 50 years. Since the founding of the modern republic in 1923, the military has regarded itself as the defender of the secular legacy of founder <a href = "http://www.turkishnews.com/Ataturk/">Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</a> [Turkish News profile].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Former Yugoslav presidents Zoran Lilic and Dobrica Cosic and the former president of Montenegro Momir Bulatovic have been accused of <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jx-VEnCH-VOUXpbZsH2QRuypL55Q?docId=6494085">ordering an arms increase</a> [AP report] for the Serbian army during the war in BiH. It is unclear whether the allegations, submitted by an association of Bosnian wartime camp inmates, will warrant charges to be filed against the three former Serbian leaders. 

<p>Last month, in an unprecedented civil decision, a French court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/france-court-awards-bosnia-civil-war-victims-damages-for-injuries.php">awarded</a> [JURIST report] a Bosnian family 200,000 euros (USD $280,000) for wartime abuses committed by former Bosnian Serb leaders <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Plavsic">Biljana Plavsic</a> [JURIST news archives]. The court's ruling may pave the way for victims of war crimes to obtain civil compensation from war criminals without a criminal trial. Karadzic faces <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/ind/en/090227.pdf">11 war crimes charges</a> [indictment, PDF], including counts of genocide and murder, for alleged crimes he committed during the war in BiH. Karadzic is defending himself in the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] and has denied all of the charges against him. After <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icty-suspends-karadzic-trial-for-6-weeks.php">multiple</a> <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icty-delays-karadzic-trial-for-one-month.php">suspensions</a> [JURIST reports], Karadzic's trial is expected to last through 2012. In 2009, Plavsic was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/former-bosnian-serb-president-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from a Swedish prison after serving two-thirds of her sentence for war crimes committed between July 1991 and December 1992.

The ICTY agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/icty-approves-release-of-former-bosnian.php">grant her release</a> [JURIST report], citing good behavior and "substantial evidence of rehabilitation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The inquiry into the conditions in Libya had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-council-condemns-libya-violence.php">approved by a unanimous vote</a> [JURIST report] of members of the UN Human Rights Council on February 25. The three-person team will be led by <a href="http://www.law.depaul.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_information.asp?id=5">Cherif Bassiouni</a> [official profile], who indicated that Libyan officials know that the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE7370KN20110408?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">investigative team will be arriving in Libya</a> [Reuters report] next week. The panel will cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court </a>(ICC) [official website], which last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">opened its own investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged abuses in Libya.

<p>The eruption of violence in Libya has sparked outrage over alleged abuses by Gaddafi's forces and controversy regarding the proper role of other nations in Libyan affairs. Last month, the ICC's chief prosecutor announced that Libyan officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/war-crimes-prosecution-for-attacks-on-libya-civilians-warns-icc.php">could face war crimes charges</a> [JURIST report] for attacks on civilians. Earlier in the month, the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">voted to suspend Libya</a>, which had been a member of that body. With regard to NATO military activity, commentators have argued that <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-use-of-force-against-libya-another-illegal-use-of-force.php">military intervention in Libya is contrary to international law</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In the US, one lawmaker <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/lawmaker-proposes-halt-to-us-military-action-in-libya.php">proposed legislation that would immediately halt US activities</a> [JURIST report] in enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya, stating that President Barack Obama lacked authority to utilize American forces for that role.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill is based on evidence suggesting that a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/10/us-oklahoma-abortion-idUSTRE7290C420110310">fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks</a> [Reuters report] and would require doctors to measure the age of a fetus before performing an abortion. A doctor who performs an abortion in violation of the time limit would be subject to criminal prosecution for a felony, but there would be no penalty for the woman undergoing the procedure. The bill includes additional provisions allowing civil suits to be filed for "actual damages" against the doctor performing the procedure by a woman upon whom an abortion is attempted or performed, or by the father of the unborn child if an abortion is performed. The bill also allows various parties to pursue civil remedies: <blockquote>A cause of action for injunctive relief...may be maintained by the woman upon whom an abortion was performed or attempted to be performed in violation of this act, by any person who is the spouse, parent, sibling, or guardian of, or a current or former licensed health care provider of, the woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted to be performed in violation of this act, by a district attorney with appropriate jurisdiction, or by the Attorney General.</blockquote>The bill protects the woman's anonymity in any court proceeding resulting from the proposed abortion law. The <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/senate/senate.html">Alabama Senate</a> [official website] will review the bill. 

<p>Alabama's House bill is part of a wave of acts passed by state legislatures since the November elections aimed at restricting abortions. On Wednesday, the <a href="http://www.ohiosenate.gov/">Ohio Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would limit the availability of abortions after 20 weeks. A day earlier, the <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/">Idaho legislature</a> [official website] gave <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">final approval to a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks. Last week, the <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit doctors from performing late-term abortions in the state. Last month, the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/">Kansas Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/idaho-kansas-lawmakers-approve-bans-on-late-term-abortions.php">approved legislation</a> restricting late-term abortions, after the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved the measure</a> [JURIST reports] in February. Bills proposing similar abortion restrictions were also approved last month in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">Missouri House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma House of Representatives</a> [JURIST reports].

<p>Egypt has been heavily criticized by rights groups and international organizations for its handling of protesters. In February, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported new evidence that the Supreme Military Council of Egypt had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-alleges-new-evidence-of-detainee-abuse-by-egypt-military.php">torturing protester-detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Through various detainee accounts, AI stated that individuals were tortured "to intimidate protesters and to obtain information about plans for the protests." Also in February, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the Egyptian military was improperly detaining protesters and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">allowing prisoner abuse</a> [JURIST report]. The report calculated at least 119 arbitrary detentions and five incidents of torture, providing detainee accounts. HRW contends that the military was targeting human rights activists, protesters and journalists. In January, UN officials including <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> and  <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">urged the Egyptian government to exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] and respect the rights of protesters. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges against the men under the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] of the ICC include rape, murder, forcible deportation and persecution. The purpose of the hearing was to verify the identity of the suspects, inform them of their rights under the Rome statute and to ensure that they were informed of the pending charges. Uhuru Muigui Kenyatta, current Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, was among those appearing before the court, and is accused of conspiring with the <a href="http://www.saferaccess.org/documents/The%20Mungiki%20-%20Cult%20Street%20Gang%20or%20Political%20Force.pdf">Mungiki criminal organization</a> [Safer Access backgrounder, PDF] to target members of an opposing political party. During the hearing the presiding judge also noted that the court was aware of reports of efforts within Kenya to reignite the violence, and stressed that "retriggering the violence in Kenya, by way of delivering dangerous speeches" would not be tolerated and would result in "drastic measures," including issuing arrest warrants if <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-warns-kenya-suspects-will-be-arrested-if-court-rules-not-followed.php">court procedures are not followed</a> [JURIST report]. The court is scheduled to hold a confirmation of charges hearing in September in order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence against the suspects to continue to trial. 

<p>Three Kenyan leaders connected with the opposing political party <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-deny-charges-of-ethnic-killings.php">appeared before the ICC</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday for their alleged roles in the election violence. Together the two groups of suspects are known as the "Ocampo Six" and their hearings were separated based upon political party affiliation. The men brought before the ICC on Thursday are members of the <a href="http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website] and were charged with targeting members of the opposing Party for National Unity (PNU) following the election of Kenyan  <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile], which they claimed was rigged. All six suspects are believed to have fomented violence, rape and destruction of property during the 30 days of post-election violence, and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">ICC summoned the suspects</a> [JURIST report] after determining they were not charged in Kenya for the alleged crimes. Last week, Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requested that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the government is capable of prosecuting the six men domestically. The Kenyan government also announced last month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/kenya-to-challenge-icc-summons.php">challenge the admissibility of cases</a> [JURIST report] relating to the post-election violence in the ICC, as well as the jurisdiction of the court. </p>

The 33-24 House vote follows Senate approval of the bill after it was amended to prohibit allowing guns inside campus buildings. Supporters of the bill assert that the constitutional right to bears arms should still be upheld on campuses, and that the bill will help people on college campuses to defend themselves in the case of a campus shooting. Opponents of the bill are concerned with putting campus police in danger if a shooting were to occur. Opponents also express fear about guns being on campus when students are emotional due to the stress of grades, exams and other situations. The bill will now be passed on to <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/About_Gov.asp">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website].  If Brewer approves the bill, Arizona will become the second state, after Utah, to allow guns on college campuses. 

<p>This bill's approval comes shortly after Arizona's January shootings, during which <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/arizona-federal-judge-killed-in-shooting-congresswoman-in-critical-condition.php">six people were killed</a> [JURIST report] and 13 were wounded, including a federal judge and US <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/">Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AZ) [official website].  Last month, in response to the shootings, President Barack Obama called for a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-calls-for-gun-law-reforms-to-minimize-violence.php">greater enforcement of gun laws</a> [JURIST report] in order to minimize gun violence.  However, Arizona, known as <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2011/01/31/20110131arizona-gun-bill-aims-loosen-laws.html">one of the most liberal gun law states</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report] in the nation, is working to loosen even more gun law restrictions. Last year, Arizona passed a law allowing people to <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/azelections/articles/2010/04/16/20100416arizona-concealed-weapons-bill16-ON.html">carry concealed weapons on their body without a permit</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report]. Gun owners may also carry their weapons inside the state Capitol and in other government buildings. Currently, at least ten other pieces of gun-related proposals are pending in the Arizona legislature. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Van Hollen</a> [official website] on Thursday filed a filed a <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/news/files/Petition_for_Supervisory_Writ-9048895_v1.pdf">Petition for Supervisory Writ</a> [text, PDF] directly to the state Supreme Court over a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">circuit court judge's temporary blocking</a> [JURIST report] of a controversial bill that limits the rights of public employee unions. The suit claims that <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] Judge Maryann Sumi did not have the constitutional authority to block the publication of the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11 text, PDF]. It then asks the <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] to immediately take jurisdiction of the case and dismiss it. A Petition for Supervisory Writ is not a direct appeal of any lower court decision, but rather a procedure that <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/809/VII/70">starts a new action altogether</a> [Wis. Stat. 809.70 text] because the petitioner claims a judge violated his or her constitutional authority.

<p>Last month, Sumi <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-clarifies-ruling-blocking-union-bargaining-law.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] clarifying that the temporary restraining order issued March 18 prohibits not only publication of the bill, but implementation of its provisions as well. Sumi's order was issued in response to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-union-bargaining-bill-may-become-law-despite-judicial-order.php">debate among government officials</a> [JURIST report] that the law went into effect after it was published on the Wisconsin Legislative Bureau's website.

HRW deputy Middle East director Joe Stork criticized the island kingdom for using the emergency law to trample on human rights and create a state of fear. In a <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2011/Bahrain_BP_Final_06042011_2106_FR-EN%20LOGO.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released on Thursday, DWB revealed that military-inflicted wounds were being used to identify protesters in hospitals for arrest and denial of medical care, leading many injured to avoid seeking medical care. DWB general director Christopher Stokes expressed frustration:<blockquote>The action by the military to declare the hospital a legitimate military target, and the use of the health system as a tool by the security apparatus, completely ignores and undermines the fact that all patients have a right to treatment in a safe environment, and that all medical staff have a fundamental duty to administer treatment without discrimination</blockquote>HRW cited reports of 430 missing and detained persons who remain unaccounted for by the government.  

<p>Last month, six <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">opposition leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Bahrain after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in the capital of Manana. Days earlier, Bahraini King <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">three-month state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">called on the King to impose martial law</a> [JURIST report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Also last month, the member states of the GCC, which includes Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786">deployed troops to Bahrain</a> [BBC report] for the purpose of guarding oil installations and financial institutions. The Bahraini government's response to the ongoing protests have prompted international concern.

The report outlined three prevailing trends that shaped human rights in 2010. These included the growth of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the increase in access to the Internet and mobile phones, and the continuing escalation of violence, persecution and discrimination. The report also noted that the impact of the ongoing <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">protests in the Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder] on international human rights could not be known:<blockquote>[W]e cannot predict the outcome of these changes, and we will not know the lasting impacts for years to come. The internal dynamics in each of these countries are different, so sweeping analysis of the entire region is not appropriate. In places like Tunisia and Egypt, we are witnessing popular demands for meaningful political participation, fundamental freedoms, and greater economic opportunity. These demands are profound, they are homegrown, and they are being driven by new activists, many of them young people. These citizens seek to build sustainable democracies in their countries with governments that respect the universal human rights of their own people. If they succeed, the Middle East region, and with it the whole world, will be improved.</blockquote>In Africa, the report noted the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/benin-court-confirms-presidential-election-results-amid-fraud-allegations.php">"generally free and fair" presidential elections</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154331.htm">Benin</a> [materials], but that local and municipal elections were replete with irregularities and that the country still faced vigilante violence, police abuse and female genital mutilation. In <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154352.htm">Kenya</a> [materials], despite the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">enactment of a new constitution</a> following a free and fair <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/opponents-of-kenya-constitution-concede-in-referendum.php">national referendum</a> [JURIST reports], the country still faces corruption, ethnic violence, discrimination and police abuse. In <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154369.htm">Somalia</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=somalia">news archive</a>], the report outlined progress, particularly in the autonomous regions of Somaliland and Puntland, in addition to rights set backs under the Transitional Federal Government in Mogadishu. 

<p>In East Asia and the Pacific, the report noted a downward trend in human rights in <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154382.htm">China</a> [materials]: "the government took additional steps to rein in civil society, particularly organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public interest issues, and increased attempts to limit freedom of speech and to control the press, the Internet, and Internet access." DOS also pointed to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">detention of Liu Xiaobo</a> [JURIST report] and ongoing corruption, widespread censorship, extrajudicial killings and a lack of due process. In <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154380.htm">Myanmar</a> [materials], DOS accused the military government of severe human rights abuses, including "extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, disappearances, rape, and torture," and the failure to investigate a 2003 attack on opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Suu+Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>

<p>In Europe and Eurasia, DOS criticized <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154424.htm">France</a>, <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154426.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154454.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154431.htm">Italy</a> [materials] for their treatment of the Roma minority and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/switzerland-voters-approve-ban-on.php">Swiss ban on minarets</a> [JURIST reports]. <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154455.htm">Turkey</a> [materials] also faced criticism over the rights of minorities, but noted improvement in rights as Turkey attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/turkish-voters-approve-constitutional-reforms.php">reform its constitution</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/turkish-government-urged-to-make.php">join the EU</a> [JURIST reports]. <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154413.htm">Azerbaijan</a> [materials] faced human rights issues, particularly relating to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/failure-to-release-convicted-azeri-journalist-violates-echr-order-hrw.php">arrests of prominent journalists</a> [JURIST report].  </p>

<p>In the Near East and North Africa, DOS found the recent protests and uprisings in <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154460.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154467.htm">Libya</a>, <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154474.htm">Tunisia</a>, <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154459.htm">Bahrain</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154476.htm">Yemen</a> [materials] had an ambiguous impact on human rights in the region, particularly in the context of the government overthrows in <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egypt</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisia</a> [JURIST reports]. The report also pointed to the ongoing extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, police and military abuses and restrictions on freedom of expression. </p>

<p>In South and Central Asia, the governments of <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154477.htm">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154485.htm">Pakistan</a> [materials] were criticized for their conduct in the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/karzai-declared-winner-of-afghanistan.php">presidential elections in Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] were marred by significant irregularities and voter intimidation, according to DOS. In contrast, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-lawmakers-elect-bhutto-widower.php">2008 Pakistani elections</a> [JURIST report] were "competitive and reflective of the people's will," restoring democratic rule and leading to some human rights progress. <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154482.htm">Kyrgyzstan</a> [materials] still faced significant rights issues and ethnic violence despite the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">overthrow of an authoritarian government</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-constitution-takes-effect-after-referendum-results-confirmed.php">passage of a new constitution</a> [JURIST reports].</p>

<p>In the Western Hemisphere, the report criticized the governments of <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154501.htm">Cuba</a> and <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154523.htm">Venezuela</a> [materials] for harassment by authorities, abuse, and threats against political opponents by state security officials acting with impunity.

The <a href="http://fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/fcc-approves-net-neutrality-rules.php">approved the regulations last year</a> [JURIST report], which prevent Internet providers from selectively blocking web access. The House <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/08/congress-internet-idUSN0825411720110408">voted 240-179</a> [Reuters report] in favor of a resolution that blocks the regulations. House Majority Leader <a href="http://cantor.house.gov/">Eric Cantor</a> (R-VA) [official website] <a href="http://www.majorityleader.gov/newsroom/seven/congressman-cantor-statement-on-resolution-of-disapproval-of-net-neutrality-regulations.html">applauded the passage</a> [statement] as "an important step" for House republicans:<blockquote>These regulations give the government unwarranted authority to control broadband networks which ultimately will hinder a thriving industry, harm competition and stifle innovation...The passage of this resolution is part of House Republicans' pro-growth agenda to give business people in this county the chance to grow, innovate and compete so that people can get back to work.</blockquote>House Minority Leader <a href="http://pelosi.house.gov/">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA) [official website] <a href="http://www.democraticleader.gov/news/press?id=2122">criticized the resolution</a> [statement], stating that it "will not become law" and that it hinders competition amongst service providers and revokes "basic consumer protections."

<p>On Monday, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-fcc-net-neutrality-rules.php">granted a motion by the FCC to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to the new net neutrality rules. The court dismissed the appeal for improper timing because the challenged rulemaking document has yet to be published in the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/">Federal Register</a> [official website]. The challenges were filed by <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">Verizon</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/cell-phone-company-sues-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rules.php">MetroPCS</a> [JURIST reports] in January out of concern over the broad authority the regulations would grant to the FCC. A previous court ruling found that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">FCC lacks the power to enforce net neutrality</a> [JURIST report]. Net neutrality is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecuting attorneys will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13021002">attempt to have Carriles extradited</a> [BBC report] to Venezuela for further proceedings.

According to the report, forces loyal to Ouattara, known as the Republican Forces of Cote d'Ivoire, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of rival <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] and burned at least 10 villages over the past month. The report also accused forces loyal to Gbagbo of killing at least 100 rival supporters in the month of March. Three HRW investigators conducted investigations and interviews with Ivory Coast civilians over the past month and determined that numerous abuses had occurred on both sides of the political conflict. The report calls on Ouattara to investigate these various violations of International Law and to prosecute those responsible for human rights violations:<blockquote>Both pro-Ouattara and pro-Gbagbo forces are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, for a non-international armed conflict, as found in the Protocol II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and customary international law. ... Anyone who participates in, orders, or has command responsibility for serious laws-of-war violations committed with criminal intent may be prosecuted for war crimes. Serious crimes, including murder and rape, committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, such as a political or ethnic group, may be prosecuted as crimes against humanity. States have a responsibility to investigate and prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on their territory, or ensure that individuals implicated are prosecuted in another venue.</blockquote>The report emphasized that human rights violations have been a continuous occurrence during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">Ivory Coast political conflict</a> [JURIST news archive] and called on Ouattara to provide as much protection as possible to civilians to prevent the continuance of these abuses. 

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] told reporters that he is  <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icc-prosecutor-urges-probe-into-recent-ivory-coast-violence.php">willing to investigate</a> [JURIST report] alleged war crimes in the Ivory Coast, but a lack of referrals is impeding the process. Last week, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence that took place. Earlier, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-restraint-caution-in-ivory-coast.php">urged all parties in the Ivory Coast to show restraint</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, the OHCHR called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">independent investigation into post-election violence</a> [JURIST report]. In January, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-warns-of-possible-ivory-coast-genocide.php">UN officials expressed "grave concerns"</a> [JURIST report] regarding the post-election violence, cautioning that genocide could be imminent. In February, Gbagbo <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ivory-coast-president-dissolves.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report] the country's parliament and electoral commission based on allegations of voter fraud in the long delayed presidential elections. On disbanding the government, Gbagbo charged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793729.stm">Prime Minister Guillaume Soro</a> [BBC profile] with creation of new government and new election format. The violence stems from Gbagbo's refusal to cede power to president-elect Alassane Ouattara, who won the November 2010 runoff election according to international observers. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 to serve a five-year term, but he has managed to stay in office, delaying six successive elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

However, France's <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/homepage.14.html">Constitutional Council</a> [official website] has stated this prohibition cannot "unduly ... restrict the exercise of religious freedom in places of worship are open to the public."

<p>In October, the French Constitutional Council ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ban conforms with the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The bill was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-approves-burqa-ban.php">National Assembly</a> in July and by the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-senate-approves-burqa-ban.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] in September. Legislation banning the use of Islamic burqas has been a point of contention recently in many European countries. In October, Dutch politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=5&Itemid=103">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website, in Dutch] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition.

Gbagbo surrendered after French <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13039825">tanks moved in on his residence</a> [BBC report] while it was surrounded by opposition leader Alassane Ouattara's forces. Gbagbo has refused to leave office since he was defeated in the presidential elections last November. France had deployed forces to the Ivory Coast as part of a UN-backed peacekeeping mission to stem <a href = "https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/iv.html">violence over the November election</a> [CIA backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">news archive</a>]. It was reported that French special forces had captured Gbagbo and turned him over to Ouattar's forces, but Youssoufou Bamba, the UN envoy of president-elect Ouattara, said it was the opposition leader's forces who made the arrest. However, there are still other <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ivory-coast-strongman-arrested-after-french-forces-intervene/2011/04/11/AFOBaeKD_story.html">conflicting reports</a> [WP report] over what forces actually made the arrest. Gbagbo is being held in a hotel with his family under the protection of UN and pro-Ouattara forces. France has claimed that its <a href="http://ph.news.yahoo.com/france-says-ivory-coast-action-only-un-orders-20110405-040413-573.html">intervention in its former colony</a> [Reuters report] is only at the UN's request. 

<p>Last week, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of Cote d'Ivoire, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.

The resolution, sponsored by Russia, calls for the creation of piracy courts outside of Somalia and cooperation among countries in combating the piracy problem. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin stated that this was the "first practical step in the direction of creating an effective judicial mechanism, one capable of a credible, reliable solution to the problem of bringing pirates to justice." Churkin further asserted:<blockquote>The worsening situation with piracy off the coast of Somalia requires the international community to adopt qualitatively new measures to combat it. Today we've taken a big step ahead in fighting piracy. The resolution adopted upon our initiative contains a wide array of qualitatively new measures aimed at establishing the necessary conditions for more effectively counteracting the pirates.</blockquote><a href="http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/obp/">Oceans Beyond Piracy</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://oceansbeyondpiracy.org/documents/The_Economic_Cost_of_Piracy_Summary.pdf">estimated the total cost of piracy</a> [report, PDF] in 2010 to be $7 - $12 billion, including $148 million spent on ransoms and up to $3 billion on re-routing ships.

Garzon's order was a part of his <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5j-lRuSEaMuU4eqMyD0OY235jzEVA?docId=6531319">investigation</a> [AP report] into a network of businesses alleged to have given money and other gifts to members of Spain's Popular Party, in exchange for contracts in regions under the party's governance. This investigation, now known as <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/escuchas/caso/Gurtel/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_9/Tes">"el caso GUrtel"</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish], was commenced by Garzon in 2009, with the wiretap order issued in February of that year. He based his order to wiretap the jailhouse on his belief that it would yield incriminating evidence as the lawyers may be acting as liaisons with others suspected of involvement in this network. However, the court found that Garzon extended the amount of time the jailhouse was wiretapped even after he discovered that the majority of the initial conversations overheard dealt mostly with defense strategies. 

<p>Monday's indictment by the Spanish Supreme Court is the second for Garzon. Last month, he <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/spain-judge-garzon-petitions-europe-rights-court-over-franco-probe.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging a case brought against him in Spain that alleges abuse of power in investigating crimes committed under the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Franco dictatorship</a> [BBC backgrounder]. In that case, Garzon faces <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">charges of politically motivated corruption</a> [JURIST report] and violation of the 1977 Amnesty Law, which affords amnesty for Franco-era crimes. The charges are based on Garzon's 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">order</a> [JURIST report] for certain government agencies, the Episcopal Conference, the University of Granada and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves, as well as the circumstances and dates of their burial. His petition follows the September 2010 decision of the Criminal Chamber of the Spanish Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/spain-high-court-confirms-decision-against-judge-garzon-in-franco-probe.php">unanimously confirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court order that Garzon abused his power and must face trial. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The attacks, led by forces supporting Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] have claimed more than 250 civilian lives within the last month in the city of Misrata. According to international law, attacks from either party in conflict that do not differentiate between civilians and combatants are impermissible. Furthermore, the law requires that any force applied must take all measures to reduce the harm of civilians. Although the Libyan government denies using  indiscriminate force on citizens, many civilians have reported abuse such as shootings in medical facilities and populated areas where there is no threat of of war. The ensuing violence is a large concern for HRW particularly because the government has blocked the city from receiving humanitarian aid. HRW claims this is yet another reason why the Libyan government is in violation of international law because conflicting parties must allow humanitarian organizations to provide quick and unimpeded aid to civilians.  

<p>Attacks on civilians have been the center of several investigations into human rights abuses in Libya. Earlier this month, the UN announced that <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-to-investigate-alleged-human-rights-abuses-in-libya.php">investigators would enter Libya</a> [JURIST report]  to begin looking into alleged human rights abuses by both rebels and the armed forces. Last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official websites] announced that Libyan officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/war-crimes-prosecution-for-attacks-on-libya-civilians-warns-icc.php">could face war crimes charges</a> [JURIST report] for attacks on civilians. Additionally, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">ICC launched a probe to investigate allegations</a> [JURIST report] of crimes against humanity by the Libyan government. Moreno-Ocampo specifically identified Gaddafi, his sons and his political allies as targets of the investigation and warned Libyan officials that complicity in such abuses would result in prosecution. The UN General Assembly has<a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php"> voted to suspend Libya</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in response to the violent suppression of peaceful protesters by forces loyal to Gaddafi. The ICC has also said that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-no-immunity-for-perpetrators-of-crimes-against-humanity-in-libya.php">not grant immunity</a> [JURIST report] to any person perpetrating crimes against humanity in Libya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After just two-and-a-half hours, Berlusconi <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2011-04-11-EU-Italy-Berlusconi-Trial/id-8374024c2b944ca2ae7311d47f56e3a9">left the trial</a> [AP report] saying the prosecution had no case against him and that the hearing was a waste of time. Berlusconi's media empire, <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_en.shtml">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian] is accused of purchasing television rights for US movies through offshore companies and falsely declaring the costs on its taxes. Mediaset Chairman <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/investor/governance/organi/scheda_1_en.shtml">Fedele Confalonieri</a> [Mediaset profile] and producer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0013261/">Frank Agrama</a> [IMDB profile] are among the 10 others charged in the case. During Monday's hearing, witnesses provided testimony on the purchase of television rights for Italian television. The trial was set to continue into the afternoon without Berlusconi. Last month, Berlusconi <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">attended a hearing</a> [JURIST report] to defend himself against separate charges of fraud and embezzlement. In that case, Berlusconi is accused of inflating the price paid to buy television rights for his company Mediaset to fund political activities. Prior to that hearing, Berlusconi had not attended a case hearing for more than seven years. 

<p>The recent appearances are a rarity for Berlusconi who has been a defendant in close to 50 trials but has consistently stayed away from court. He stated that we would attend as many trials in the four active court cases against him as he can. Last week, Berlusconi failed to attend a trial on charges against him for abusing the power of his office and allegedly offering cash and jewels in exchange for sex with a minor. The minor, Moroccan-born 17-year-old Karima El Mahroug, known as Ruby, also failed to attend the hearing. In addition to the payments, Berlusconi also allegedly called police to secure Ruby's release while she was detained on an unrelated suspicion of theft. The trial was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-trial-for-prostitution-and-abuse-of-power-charges-ajourns-after-10-minutes.php">adjourned</a> [JURIST report] after only 10 minutes of opening. In February, an Italian judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">ordered Berlusconi to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on the charges of paying for sex with a minor and abuse of power. Both Ruby and Berlusconi maintain that the two never had sex, and Berlusconi has denied any wrongdoing and has called the charges groundless. In January, the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_320.do">Italian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">law</a> [materials, in Italian] backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary immunity from charges while in office. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In July, the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">granted a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] blocking implementation of the law. Affirming the decision below, the Ninth Circuit held that "the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the United States demonstrated that it faced irreparable harm and that granting the preliminary injunction properly balanced the equities and was in the public interest." In addressing the equities and public interest, the Ninth Circuit indicated that the constitutional infringement of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] alleged by the DOJ could itself constitute irreparable harm to the federal government absent injunctive relief:<blockquote>We have found that "it is <em>clear that it would not be equitable or in the public's interest to allow the state</em> ... to violate the requirements of federal law, especially when there are no adequate remedies available. ... In such circumstances, the interest of preserving the Supremacy Clause is paramount."</blockquote>The decision is expected to be appealed to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. 

<p>Last year, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the state of Arizona and <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] arguing that both the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country." The agency also claimed that the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and that the enforcement of the Arizona law is counterproductive to the national immigration policy. The Arizona law, which criminalizes illegal immigration and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally, was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in April of last year. The law faces several additional legal challenges including a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">class-action law suit</a> [JURIST report] filed by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website] on behalf of a number of advocacy groups and several private individuals. A <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/tucson-joins-lawsuit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">challenge brought by several Tucson police officers</a> claiming the law could not be properly implemented without racially profiling was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-dismisses-police-officer-suit-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST reports] late last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." According to the report, at least 28 protesters died Friday in protests spread across three cities. Witnesses said security forces opened fire when civilians tried to remove the injured from the scenes and that in Daraa an ambulance was blocked from reaching wounded protesters. Witnesses also reported that security forces controlled hospitals in Daraa and Harasta and would not admit injured protesters. State-controlled media <a href="http://www.sana.sy/ara/2/2011/04/10/340764.htm">claimed that protesters attacked members of the security forces</a> [Sana report, in Arabic], killing 19 of them.

Al-Assad announced earlier in March that the government would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">consider ending the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Ferdinand Marcos ruled the Philippines for 20 years. It is estimated that he and his family stole approximately $10 million of government funds.

The 25-year-old blogger and activist was <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/11/egypt-blogger-s-3-year-sentence-blow-free-speech">arrested</a> [HRW report] at his home on March 28 and charged with "insulting the military establishment" and "spreading false information" for criticizing the army's handling of the revolution that began on January 25. He <a href="http://www.maikelnabil.com/2011/03/blog-post_07.html">posted an article on his blog</a> [text, in Arabic] on March 7 saying the army had beat, tortured and killed protesters, including some who were cooperating with security forces. He was then sentenced without a formal hearing and without his lawyers present. HRW deputy Middle East Director Joe Stork released a statement calling the conviction the worst free speech violation in years:<blockquote>Maikel Nabil's three-year sentence may be the worst strike against free expression in Egypt since the Mubarak government jailed the first blogger for four years in 2007. The sentence is not only severe, but it was imposed by a military tribunal after an unfair trial.</blockquote>Nabil's lawyers from the <a href="http://www.anhri.net/">Arabic Network for Human Rights Information</a> [advocacy website] said that they were told the court would <a href="http://www.anhri.net/?p=2378">rule on the case on April 12</a> [press release, in Arabic], but the lawyers learned that the court had already ruled and sentenced Nabil on April 11 without their presence. 

<p>The blogger's conviction raises doubts about the military's commitment to reform after <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6045958.stm">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile] stepped down. Last month, the Egyptian <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> [NYT backgrounder] unveiled an interim constitution that allows the council to retain control over the country until an elected government is installed. The document vests the military council with <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/8953/Egypt/Politics-/Armed-Forces-announces-Egypts-interim-Constitution.aspx">presidential powers</a> [<em>Al-Ahram</em> report], including the abilities to introduce legislation, veto existing laws and act as Egypt's representative to the international community. Last November, Egypt released blogger <a href="http://www.freekareem.org/">Abdel Kareem Nabil</a> [advocacy website] after four years of imprisonment on charges of insulting Islam and causing sectarian strife on his <a href="http://karam903.blogspot.com/">blog</a> [website, in Arabic]. Nabil, a former law student, was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-blogger-sentenced-to-prison-for.php">convicted in 2007</a> [JURIST report] for posting statements critical of Islamic authorities and former president Mubarak, calling him a dictator. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ouattara guaranteed the security of Gbagbo and his family but stated that Gbagbo, his wife Simone and their collaborators would be <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13044818">investigated by judicial authorities</a> [BBC Report]. Ouattara also announced that he will set up a truth and reconciliation commission and asked Ivorians to abstain from all reprisals and violence. He also asked the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> [official website] to lift sanctions on the ports of Abidjan and San Pedro and promised to restore security, utilities and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/08/ivory-coast-ouattara-end-eu-sanctions">meet the basic needs of the people</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]

<p>Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">captured on Monday</a> [JURIST report] after six months of turmoil. Gbagbo had refused to surrender the presidency after he was defeated in the presidential elections last November. Last week, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of Cote d'Ivoire, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence. Earlier, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-restraint-caution-in-ivory-coast.php">urged all parties in the Ivory Coast to show restraint</a> and called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">independent investigation into post-election violence</a> [JURIST reports]. In January, UN officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-warns-of-possible-ivory-coast-genocide.php">expressed "grave concerns"</a> [JURIST report] regarding the post-election violence, cautioning that genocide could be imminent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE14/013/2011/en/991fffba-1762-43d1-8b4f-1555eb568d17/mde140132011en.pdf">"Days of Rage: Protests and Repression in Iraq"</a> [text, PDF], asserts that Iraqi and Kurdistan authorities have shot and killed demonstrators and have detained and tortured political activists, targeting journalists covering the protests. According to the report, thousands of Iraqis have engaged in peaceful protests since February, calling for an end to unemployment, inadequate government services and corruption. The report calls for an end to human rights violations related to the demonstrations:<blockquote>Up to now, the Iraqi authorities in both Baghdad and the Kurdistan region have sought to crack down on peaceful protestors. This must change. They should be cracking down on the use of excessive force and torture by their own largely unaccountable security forces, not on the right of people to peacefully protest. The Iraqi authorities should be upholding the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including the right to protest, not trying to suppress them. It is high time to do so.</blockquote>AI alleges that Iraqi authorities have breached the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/documents/iraqi_constitution.pdf">Iraqi Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and the Iraq-ratified <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], as well as the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/firearms.htm">Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (Basic Principles)</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/codeofconduct.htm">Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials</a> [text], which Iraqi armed forces and securities forces contravened when responding to the February protests. AI recommends that Iraqi authorities ensure that citizens' right to protest peacefully is not infringed and conduct thorough investigations into the killings and torture allegations.

<p>Iraq has been closely scrutinized for human rights violations. AI issued a report in September alleging that the Iraqi government is <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/thousands-iraqi-detainees-risk-torture-after-us-handover-2010-09-13">unlawfully detaining and torturing</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iraq-unlawfully-holding-torturing-thousands-of-detainees-report.php">report</a>] thousands of detainees. In June, UN Special Representative to Iraq Ad Melkert <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-advises-iraq-to-ratify-convention-against-torture.php">urged the Iraqi government</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text]. Melkert stated that Iraq had made several advances in recognizing human rights violations, but the government's policy implementation still faces several obstacles. The convention was adopted by the UN in 1984 and has been ratified by 147 countries. Iraq remains one of 45 member-countries that have yet to ratify the treaty. Last April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">reported on the repeated torture</a> [JURIST report] of Iraqi detainees in a secret prison in Baghdad. HRW reported that detainees held at the secret Muthanna facility, run by Iraqi authorities, were hung upside-down, deprived of air, kicked, whipped, beaten, given electric shocks and sodomized during torture sessions that detainees faced every three to four days. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Researchers from AI were shown the bodies of two individuals whose hands and feet had been bound, suggesting their deaths were the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/killing-captives-points-war-crimes-libyan-government-forces-2011-04-11">result of deliberate killings</a> [press release] carried out by forces loyal to Gaddafi. In addition to viewing these deceased individuals at the morgue, the researchers saw another body, similarly bound, at a hospital in the region and have received four reports of other such cases. Responding to the researchers' report, Malcolm Smart, AI's director for Middle East and North Africa, stated, "[t]he deliberate killing of captured fighters is a war crime. All those responsible for such crimes&#8212;those who ordered or sanctioned them as well as those who carried them out&#8212;must be left in no doubt that they will be held fully accountable."

<p>The actions of Gaddafi's forces in Libya have been condemned by a number of human rights as well as governmental organizations. Just this week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] asserted that indiscriminate government attacks on Libyan civilians <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-claims-libya-government-attacks-on-civilians-violate-international-law.php">violate international humanitarian law</a> [JURIST report]. The attacks, led by forces supporting Gaddafi, have claimed more than 250 civilian lives within the last month in the city of Misrata. According to international law, attacks from either party in conflict that do not differentiate between civilians and combatants are impermissible. Furthermore, the law requires that any force applied must take all measures to reduce the harm to civilians. Although the Libyan government denies using indiscriminate force on citizens, many civilians have reported abuse including shootings in medical facilities and populated areas where there is no threat of of war. Earlier this month, the UN announced that <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-to-investigate-alleged-human-rights-abuses-in-libya.php">investigators would enter Libya</a> [JURIST report] to begin looking into alleged human rights abuses by both rebels and the armed forces of Gaddafi. The inquiry into the conditions in Libya was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-council-condemns-libya-violence.php">approved by a unanimous vote</a> [JURIST report] of members of the UN Human Rights Council on February 25. The investigatory panel will cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], which last month <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">opened its own investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged abuses in Libya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Egyptian authorities <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itXAhyUDtvGI8GV0iOZ58GthpBeg?docId=CNG.10d3a9e29c2cbf7d2da3ebd746b3a9f1.8b1">continued to question Mubarak's sons</a> [AFP report] after Mubarak was taken to the hospital. In a televised statement on Sunday, Mubarak <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13029597">denied corruption charges</a> [BBC report], asserted his right to defend his reputation and expressed his <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/04/10/144957.html">willingness to cooperate</a> [Al Arabiya report] with investigations, denying that he owns property abroad or holds foreign bank accounts. The prosecutor's announcement came after tens of thousands of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-protesters-demand-swifter-prosecution-of-mubarak-regime.php">Egyptians gathered in Tahrir Square</a> [JURIST report] on Friday to demand the prosecution of Mubarak, his family and members of his regime. 

<p>Friday's protests reveal Egyptians' growing frustration with the pace at which the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-dissolves-parliament-and-scheduless-elections.php">current military council</a> is pursuing the punishment of the regime's <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-chief-prosecutor-seeks-to-freeze-ex-presidents-foreign-assets.php">political corruption</a> [JURIST reports]. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups accused Mubarak and the police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt, according to a <a href="http://www.ahram.org.eg/The-First/News/68953.aspx">local newspaper</a> [Al-Ahram report, in Arabic]. The joint commission submitted their report to Egypt's top prosecutor for further investigation. The Supreme Military Council of Egypt, which assumed power after Mubarak's resignation, instructed Egypt's top prosecutor to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110323/163161631.html">investigate the death of protesters</a> [Ria Novosti report] during the three weeks of demonstrations in the country.

The appointments include Vitit Muntabhorn, a professor of law at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, who will serve as the Chair of the Commission. Other appointees include Suliman Baldo of Sudan, a widely recognized expert on conflict resolution, emergency relief, development, and human rights in Africa; and Reine Alapini Gansou of Benin who is a lawyer and the Chairperson of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights since 2009. The announcement comes in the wake of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/france-forces-capture-besieged-cote-divoire-leader-gbagbo.php">capture and arrest</a> [JURIST report] of incumbent president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> on Monday by forces loyal to internationally recognized president, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/954870.stm">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profiles]. Although allegations of abuses are directed at both sides, a spokesman for Ouattara insisted that the <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/04/201141214193389161.html">responsibility lies exclusively at the feet of Gbagbo</a> [Aljazeera report]. The Commission of Inquiry's mandate is "to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations of serious abuses ... in order to identify those responsible fur such acts and bring them to justice."  The UNHRC believes there are hundreds of victims of ethnic and political violence that ensued following the election.

<p>Late last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ivory Coast to investigate</a> [JURIST report] human rights violations and war crimes.

Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">deaths of at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence that took place. Also this month, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-office-urges-restraint-caution-in-ivory-coast.php">urged all parties  to show restraint</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">called for an independent investigation into post-election violence</a> [JURIST report]. In January, UN officials expressed <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-warns-of-possible-ivory-coast-genocide.php">"grave concerns"</a> [JURIST report] regarding the post-election violence, cautioning that genocide could be imminent. In February, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ivory-coast-president-dissolves.php">Gbagbo dissolved the country's parliament</a> [JURIST report] and electoral commission based on allegations of voter fraud in the long delayed presidential elections. On disbanding the government, Gbagbo charged <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2793729.stm">Prime Minister Guillaume Soro</a> [BBC profile] with creation of new government and new election format. The violence stems from Gbagbo's refusal to cede power to president-elect Alassane Ouattara, who won the November 2010 runoff election according to international observers. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 to serve a five-year term, but he has managed to stay in office, delaying six successive elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This has prompted criticism from <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href = "http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI), which <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/sri-lanka-un-experts-submit-report">demanded the report be made public</a> [HRW press release; AI <a href = "http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA20110412003&lang=e">press release</a>].

Earlier this week, <a href = "http://www.defence.lk/main_abt.asp?fname=SoD">Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa</a> [official website] stated that the <a href = "http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2011/04/10/sec02.asp">government was not concerned with the report</a> [<em>Sunday Observer</em> report]. The <a href = "http://www.slmfa.gov.lk/">Sri Lankan Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced in October that a UN war crimes panel <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">would be allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to look into the final stages of the conflict with the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Tamil+Tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>A recent HRW report criticized the UN, the Human Rights Council and Ban for failing to adequately enforce human rights. The UN <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/un-defends-ban-ki-moon-rights-record-after-critical-report.php">defended against these allegations</a> [JURIST report] in January. The report specifically mentioned Ban's reluctance to put pressure on abusive governments, and substituting dialogue and cooperation for public pressure to promote human rights. HRW's report highlighted the UN's <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/UN-SG-urges-sri-lanka-to-normalize-conditions-around-un-offices.php">deference toward atrocities in Sri Lanka</a> [JURIST report] as an example of the UN's human rights shortcomings. Sri Lanka faced numerous allegations of human rights violations originating from incidents that took place during the final months of its 30-year civil war. Last May, HRW announced it had acquired <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/rights-group-claims-to-have-new-evidence-of-sri-lanka-wartime-abuses.php">new evidence</a> [JURIST report] supporting allegations of war crimes. Although Ban affirmed his commitment to set up a UN panel investigating the human rights violations in Sri Lanka, HRW was dissatisfied with the UN's response.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Uruguay's <a href="http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/palacio3/index1280.asp?e=0&w=1600">House of Representatives</a> [official website, in Spanish] must still approve the law.

<p>Prior to November's judgment, Uruguay's Supreme Court had largely upheld the amnesty <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-high-court-overturns-amnesty.php">except in extreme circumstances</a>, and in 2009 a popular vote <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-voters-reject-referendum-to-end.php">failed to overturn the law</a> [JURIST reports]. Many of the alleged kidnappings and deaths occurred in connection with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3720724.stm">Operation Condor</a> [BBC backgrounder], a cooperative effort between the governments of Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Chile to eliminate left-wing political opponents. In June, ex-military officials in Argentina were <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/argentina-ex-military-officials-go-on-trial-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for the deaths of 65 activists in connection with Operation Condor. The Uruguayan government has also attempted to bring those responsible for the disappearance of leftist activist to justice. In 2006, eight former police and military officers were <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/uruguay-indicts-8-for-operation-condor.php">indicted by a Uruguayan court</a> [JURIST report] on counts of kidnapping and conspiracy committed during the 1973-1985 dictatorship. The crimes were related to the 1976 disappearances of five members of an Uruguayan leftist group who fled to Argentina and were detained there by police, and who investigators suspect were victims of Operation Condor.</p>

The <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF] requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed, and the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">"fetal pain bill"</a> [HB 2218, PDF] restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation. Brownback took office in January and in his inaugural address urged the Republican&#8211;controlled state legislature to again attempt to pass abortion restriction legislation, which had been vetoed by Democratic governors in the last few years. The <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/chamber/senate/">Kansas Senate</a> [official website] voted last month to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/idaho-kansas-lawmakers-approve-bans-on-late-term-abortions.php">send the "fetal pain bill" to the governor</a> [JURIST report], after the <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/chamber/house/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">approved the measure</a> [JURIST report] in February. Two other abortion restriction bills have been slowed in the House: one would <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/sb65/">exclude abortion coverage</a> [SB 65 materials] from health insurance plans unless it is necessary to preserve the life of the mother, and the other would require that <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/sb36/">abortion clinics have an operating license</a> [SB 36 materials] issued by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

<p>Since the November elections state legislatures across the country have been implementing measures to restrict abortions. Last week the <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/house.html">Alabama House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approve a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of gestation, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk or she faces serious injury. The <a href="http://www.ohiosenate.gov/">Ohio Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] that would limit the availability of abortions after 20 weeks. Last month, the <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/">Idaho legislature</a> [official website] also gave <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">final approval to a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks. Also in March, the <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit doctors from performing any late-term abortions in the state. Bills proposing similar abortion restrictions were approved in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">Missouri House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma House of Representatives</a> [JURIST reports] last month. Also last month, South Dakota <a href="http://www.sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The letter assured Spain that the US is investigating the treatment of detainees and has already completed federal criminal prosecution for the detainee mistreatment. The DOJ urged Spanish courts to refer complaints of detainee mistreatment to the US for the investigation and prosecution of perpetrators. Velasco subsequently agreed to discard three lawsuits filed by former inmates who claimed to be Spanish citizens. The Obama administration told the Spanish court that the US would not investigate any of the six former Bush administration officials for allowing the torture of detainees in US custody. In response to the DOJ's letter, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights </a> (CCR) and <a href="http://www.ecchr.org/">European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights</a> (ECCHR) [advocacy websites] issued a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Spain%20rebuttal%20submission%20FINAL.pdf">rebuttal</a> [text, PDF], supporting Spain's pending criminal complaint against six US officials for alleged involvement in detainee abuse and inhumane treatment. The rebuttal stated: <blockquote>The U.S. Submission does nothing to alter the conclusion that the criminal case against the so-called "Bush Six"; is properly before the Spanish court: it demonstrates that no competent jurisdiction is investigating or prosecuting the allegations in the complaint. The listed initiatives undertaken by the US government in various fora, while indicating some small measure of concern with the "mistreatment" or "abuse" of detainees and the legal advice provided in relation to the treatment of detainees, are ultimately unresponsive and inapplicable to the allegations raised in the complaint pending in Spain. </blockquote> Velasco agreed to <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news-story.aspx?storyid=201104131147dowjonesdjonline000444&title=correctspain-throws-out-guantanamo-lawsuit-against-former-us-officials">hand over the case to US courts</a> [Dow Jones report] and pledged to submit information on the lawsuit to US authorities who will investigate the cases and decide which ones to pursue.

<p>In February, the Spanish National Court agreed to<a href="/paperchase/2011/02/spain-court-allows-guantanamo-torture-investigation-to-continue.php"> continue investigating</a> [JURIST report] allegations of a Moroccan man who claims that he was tortured while detained at Guantanamo Bay. <a href="http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo6-1985.l1t1.html">Article 23.4 of the Ley Organica del Poder Judicial</a> (LOPJ) [text, in Spanish] authorizes Spanish courts to hear certain types of international cases, but requires that the case have a <a href="http://www.publico.es/espana/363369/espana-investigara-las-torturas-de-guantanamo">"relevant connection" to Spain</a> [Publico report, in Spanish], following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-parliament-passes-law-limiting.php">limitation placed on universal jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. The court first <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-judge-opens-investigation-into.php">opened the investigation in April 2009</a> [JURIST report], looking into torture allegations at Guantanamo Bay made by four former prisoners.

Ulrich Busch, Demjanjuk's lawyer, <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,756856,00.html">requested the suspension</a> [<em>Der Spiegel</em> report, in German] to investigate the material being held at the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/dc-metro/college-park/">National Archives in Maryland</a> [officially website]. The report claims that the KGB "quite likely fabricated" evidence central to Demjanjuk's prosecution, specifically the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/slideshow/ALeqM5gzn9sjjViXpoagiQbtyuSx3oZdEg?docId=2ed960173598473c94630a9a5ebe2cbe&index=0&ned=us">Nazi ID card</a> [ID card image] he allegedly used as a guard at the Sobibor death camp. Demjanjuk, who denies the allegations, currently faces a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-prosecutor-requests-6-year-sentence-for-alleged-nazi-guard.php">six-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] if convicted. A verdict was expected within a month, but any grant of a delay may change that schedule.

<p>The Spanish National Court announced in January that it is <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/spain-seeks-extradition-of-accused-nazi-guard.php">seeking the extradition of Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST report] so he can stand trial on charges relating to his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/othercamps/flossenburg.html">Flossenburg</a> [HRP backgrounder] concentration camp where 60 Spanish citizens were killed during World War II. Demjanjuk's German trial, which began in November 2009, has been marked by extensive delay. In October 2009, Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] after the court rejected appeals relating to his health, although the court has limited hearings to no more than two 90-minute sessions per day. Demjanjuk fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. He was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/accused-nazi-guard-deported-to-germany.php">deported to Germany in May 2009</a> after the US Supreme Court denied his <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">stay of deportation</a> [JURIST reports].</p>

<p>4/14/11 - The court has rejected the defense request to suspend trial proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice David Taliano <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario/ontario-court-strikes-down-canadas-pot-laws/article1983105/">invalidated</a> [<em>Globe &#38; Mail </em>report] the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-227/index.html">Marihuana Medical Access Regulations</a> (MMAR) [text], finding that the program's mechanisms for licensing patients to access <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medical+marijuana">medical marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] are insufficient. These inadequate licensing procedures led Taliano to also strike down portions of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> [text] that criminalize marijuana growth and possession. The ruling cites systemic difficulties for patients seeking medical authorization, as doctors, many of whom lack proper training in prescribing the drug, are often hesitant to approve marijuana use for patients due to insufficient funding for clinical trials. Absent appeal, the government has 90 days to remedy MMAR's authorization processes, lest marijuana growth and use will be legal regardless of the purpose.

<p>US Courts have also been forced to interpret medical marijuana statutes in recent years. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-rejects.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state's <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials]. Earlier that month, New Jersey became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">fourteenth US state</a> [JURIST report] to legalize medical marijuana. In November, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an expansion of the state's existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine the fifth state to allow dispensaries, following California, Colorado, Rhode Island and New Mexico. California's Fourth District Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 that the MMP is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-court-rules-medical.php">not in conflict with the Supremacy Clause</a> [JURIST report] and does not violate the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Italian <a href="http://www.senato.it/index.htm">Senate</a> [official website, in Italian] passed a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34502.htm">similar version</a> [S.1880 materials, in Italian] last January, to protect citizens against an infinite duration of judicial processes. The <a href="http://www.camera.it/465?area=16&tema=389&Il+%22processo+breve%22">bill</a> [fact sheet, in Italian] is part of a comprehensive reform of the judiciary headed by Italy's <a href="http://www.giustizia.it/giustizia/it/mg_9.wp;jsessionid=BDBF9CBBA9F03CACAE9840605A4CD775.ajpAL05">Minister of Justice Angelino Alfano</a> [official website, in Italian], to bring the justice system in accordance with <a href="http://www.senato.it/istituzione/29375/131336/131391/131403/131404/articolo.htm">Article 111 of the Italian Constitution</a> and <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/treaties/html/005.htm">Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> [texts]. However, critics argue that the legislation is an attempt by the supporters of Italian <a href="http://www.governo.it/">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [official website, in Italian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE73C85G20110413?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">keep him out of jail</a> [Reuters report]. The measure, still needing final approval by the Senate, would shorten the statute of limitations in a bribery case to six or eight months&#8212;effectively ending Berlusconi's bribery trial by this summer. Berlusconi is accused of paying his British lawyer <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/david-mills-the-networker-467627.html">David Mills</a> [<em>The Independent</em> profile] USD $600,000 to falsely testify in court about his business dealings. Berlusconi currently has four active trials pending against him.

<p>The <a href="http://www.parlamento.it/">Italian Parliament</a> [official website, in Italian] has previously attempted to shield Berlusconi from trial, <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">passing a law</a> [materials, in Italian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/italy-parliament-approves-bill.php">report</a>] last March that granted the premier and other public officials temporary immunity from charges while in office. In January, the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_320.do">Italian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of the law, finding it in violation of <a href="http://www.senato.it/istituzione/29375/131276/131279/articolo.htm">Article 3 of the Italian Constitution</a> [text], which provides that "all citizens have equal social status and are equal before the law." The constitutional review of the law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/italy-judges-question-law-allowing.php">sought by judges in Milan</a> [JURIST report], where Berlusconi is charged in two cases on corruption and tax fraud. On Monday, Berlusconi <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-appears-in-court-calls-tax-fraud-hearing-a-waste-of-time.php">attended a hearing</a> [JURIST report] in Milan to defend himself against charges that his media empire, <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_en.shtml">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian], purchased television rights for US movies through offshore companies and falsely declaring the costs on its taxes. Last month, Berlusconi <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">attended a separate hearing</a> [JURIST report] to defend himself against charges of inflating the price paid to buy television rights for Mediaset to fund political activities. Prior to that hearing, Berlusconi had not attended a case hearing for more than seven years. The recent appearances are a rarity for Berlusconi who has been a defendant in close to 50 trials but has consistently stayed away from court. Last week, Berlusconi <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-trial-for-prostitution-and-abuse-of-power-charges-ajourns-after-10-minutes.php">failed to attend a trial</a> [JURIST report] on charges against him for abusing the power of his office and allegedly offering cash and jewels in exchange for sex with 17-year-old Moroccan-born Karima El Mahroug, known as Ruby. In addition to the payments, Berlusconi also allegedly called police to secure Ruby's release while she was detained on an unrelated suspicion of theft. In February, an Italian judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">ordered Berlusconi to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on the charges of paying for sex with a minor and abuse of power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Dodik alleges that the <a href="http://www.narodnaskupstinars.net/cir/naslovna/naslovna.php">court is biased</a> [AFP report] because it has prosecuted more ethnic Serbs than ethnic Croats or Muslims. Additionally, he said that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hUq5NSDgsuzXkTph-aSRPoDYMy8g?docId=6553317">international community acted in contravention</a> [AP report] of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/bosnia/bosagree.html">Dayton Peace Accords</a> [USDOS materials] by setting up the court, which was not envisaged in the Accords. After Wednesday's debate, legislators in Republika Srpska's 83-member National Assembly <a href="http://www.glassrpske.com/vijest/2/novosti/56229/cir/Referendum-gradjana-RS-o-OHR-ovim-zakonima.html">approved a referendum</a> [Serbian Voice report, in Serbian] on the matter. The date for the referendum has not been determined.

<p>Republika Srpska is a legal entity within BiH that has a predominantly ethnic-Serb population. According to statistics provided by Dodik, through 2010, ethnic Serbs have been sentenced to a total of 1,067 years of imprisonment by the war crimes court, whereas ethnic Croats were sentenced to 137.5 years and ethnic Bosniacs to 124 years of imprisonment. In addition, the statistics indicate that out of the convictions handed down by the court, 50 have been against ethnic Serbs, 11 against Croats and eight against Bosniacs. In March, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-police-officer-indicted-for-role-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">confirmed the indictment</a> [JURIST report] of a former police officer for his role in the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive]. In November, Dragan Crnogorac was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/bosnia-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-war-crimes-suspect.php">arrested in BiH</a> [JURIST report] on suspicion of having committed genocide.

The ICC's piracy reporting center, which has monitored reports of maritime piracy 24 hours a day since 1991, reports that through the end of March, 18 vessels and 344 crew members have been taken hostage, 15 of them in waters off the east coast of Somalia. Forty-five additional ships report having been boarded in 2011, with another 45 saying they have taken fire. The hijackings have accounted for the deaths of seven crew members and injuries to an additional 34. IMB director Pottengal Mukundan says that the problem continues to mount, especially around the Arabian Sea:<blockquote>Figures for piracy and armed robbery at sea in the past three months are higher than we've ever recorded in the first quarter of any past year. ... We're seeing a dramatic increase in the violence and techniques used by pirates in the seas off Somalia. The overwhelming number of vessels hijacked off Somalia took place east and north east of the Gulf of Aden. The positions of some of the attackers' mother ships are known. It is vital that strong action is taken against these mother ships to prevent further hijackings</blockquote>Mukundan said that vessels hauling large volumes of highly flammable materials, such as gas and petroleum, have been especially vulnerable. To request a PDF copy of the report, visit the ICC's <a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/index.php?option=com_fabrik&view=form&fabrik=18&random=0&Itemid=92&phpMyAdmin=F5XY3CeBeymbElbQ8jr4qlxK1J3">website</a> [report request form].

<p>Incidents of international maritime piracy continue to climb. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-security-council-to-consider-special-maritime-piracy-courts.php">approved a resolution</a> [JURIST report] to consider creating new laws, courts and prisons specialized to address the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia. Last January, the IMB <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/maritime-piracy-hits-worst-level-since.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that, to that point, 2009 marked the worst year of piracy since 2003, spiking near Somalian waters then as well. In July 2009, the IMB <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/maritime-piracy-has-doubled-in-first.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that pirate attacks around the globe doubled in the first half of 2009. Few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stem mostly from allegations that Ben Ali authorized the use of force against protesters during the Tunisian revolution, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 protesters.

In his announcement, US Attorney Neil MacBride wrote, "[t]oday marks the first time that the U.S. government has captured and charged an alleged pirate in a leadership role&#8212;a hostage negotiator who operated in Somalia." Mohammad Saaili Shibin, 50, was reportedly captured by the FBI and military on April 4 and sent to the US to face criminal charges for negotiating ransom payments for four Americans who were kidnapped in February when their yacht was hijacked near Oman. All four hostages were subsequently killed. According to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE73C0MC20110413?sp=true">news reports</a> [Reuters report], pirates seized the yacht and were negotiating with the US military when a pirate fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the destroyer USS Sterett. Gunfire then broke out inside the pirate vessel, which prompted American special forces to board the ship, killing two pirates in the process, only to find two more dead pirates and the four slain hostages. Shibin's indictment alleges he performed Internet research to determine both an appropriate ransom amount for the hostages and how to contact their families to make demands for payment. Shibin and 14 alleged co-conspirators have been charged with piracy, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and use of firearms during a crime of violence. If convicted the men could face life in prison. Shibin will remain in federal custody, with his arraignment scheduled for April 27.

The decision overturns last year's <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/doj-to-appeal-ruling-finding-national.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] that the day of prayer more than acknowledged religion, but was an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. In a 3-0 decision, the panel concluded that the plaintiffs, members of the <a href="http://www.ffrf.org/">Freedom From Religion Foundation</a> (FFRF) [advocacy website], do not have standing to challenge the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/36/119.html">day of prayer statute</a> [text]. According to the court, because the day of prayer proclamation does not force private citizens "to do anything," the plaintiffs could not have been harmed and, therefore, have no standing to challenge. Chairman of the NDP Task Force, <a href="http://nationaldayofprayer.org/about/leadership/shirley-dobson-chairman/">Shirley Dobson</a> [official profile] <a href="http://nationaldayofprayer.org/media/news-releases/">applauded the decision</a> [press release] and called it a victory:<blockquote>Since the days of our Founding Fathers, the government has protected and encouraged public prayer and other expressions of dependence on the Almighty. Prayer is an indispensable part of our heritage, and as citizens, we must remain faithful in our commitment to intercede for our nation during this pivotal and challenging time.</blockquote>This year's National Day of Prayer will take place on May 5. The FFRF has announced that it will <a href="http://www.ffrf.org/news/releases/ffrf-to-seek-en-banc-rehearing-on-national-day-of-prayer-ruling-in-7th/">petition for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing</a> [press release] of the case. 

<p>Last year, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ninth-circuit-upholds-pledge-of.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a teacher-led recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools does not violate the Constitution's Establishment Clause. The court also upheld the use of the phrase "In God We Trust" on currency. In November 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a school district's policy prohibiting the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-upholds-school-ban-on.php">performance of religious holiday songs does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the establishment clause. Also that month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-rules-christian-themed.php">license plates</a> [JURIST report] produced by the state bearing a picture of a cross in front of a stained glass window and the words "I Believe" violate the Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its <a href="http://www.hrcp-web.org/Publications/AR2010.pdf">2010 Annual Report</a> [text, PDF], the group chronicles the repeated human rights violations that have taken place in the country over the past year, citing growing intolerance and extremism in the country. The report praises Pakistan's ratification of various international human rights treaties but acknowledges that immediate improvements have yet to be seen. The report criticizes the government for failing to address the violations and encourages the government to step up its prevention of ongoing abuses. According to the report, religious minority citizens and women, suffered the most abuses. The report also states that every level of the government failed in its protection of basic human rights and encourages the government to implement "mechanisms" to oversee that all international human rights treaties are being followed. The government was also blamed for its inability to reform <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blasphemy">blasphemy laws</a> and abolish the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abolish+death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. 

<p>Last week, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the 2010 <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials]. The governments of Afghanistan and <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154485.htm">Pakistan</a> [materials] were criticized for their conduct in the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda. However, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-lawmakers-elect-bhutto-widower.php">2008 Pakistani elections</a> [JURIST report] were deemed "competitive and reflective of the people's will," restoring democratic rule and leading to some human rights progress. Last month, UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-pakistan-blasphemy-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the assassination of Pakistani Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti and expressed her opposition to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law. Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] during an argument with other women in her village last year. Bhatti had spoken out in favor of reforming the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Maryann Sumi ruled that the two county officials who filed the complaint lacked standing to sue as government representatives, but could sue as individuals. Sumi explained in the opinion: "Dane County's claims are not statutory; they are constitutional. Under longstanding Wisconsin law, an agency or arm of government lacks authority to challenge the constitutionality of state statutes." Dane <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/exec/kathleen_falk.aspx">County Executive Kathleen Falk</a> and <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/board/supervisor_bios/scottmcdonell.aspx">County Board Chairman Scott McDonell</a> [official profiles] filed the complaint last month, arguing that the state's new <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11 text, PDF] violated the <a href="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/rsb/unannotated_wisconst.pdf">Wisconsin Constitution</a> [PDF] and the state <a href="http://www.wisfoic.org/an-openmeetingslaw.html">open meetings law</a> [text], a rule that requires 24-hour notice of public meetings in non-emergency situations. Falk said in a statement on Thursday that, while the decision prohibits county officials from challenging the constitutionality of the bill, the state district attorney and attorney general may <a href="www.thewheelerreport.com/releases/April11/0414/0414falkcourt.pdf">still litigate the issue</a> [press release, PDF]. 

<p>Last week, Wisconsin <a href="http://www.vanhollenforag.com/Home.aspx">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/wisconsin-ag-sues-judge-calls-for-supreme-court-intervention.php">Petition for Supervisory Writ</a> directly to the state Supreme Court over Sumi <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">temporarily blocking</a> [JURIST reports] the union bargaining bill last month. The suit claimed that Sumi did not have the constitutional authority to block the publication of the bill. Last month, Sumi <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-clarifies-ruling-blocking-union-bargaining-law.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] clarifying that the temporary restraining order prohibits not only publication of the bill, but implementation of its provisions as well. Sumi's order was issued in response to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-union-bargaining-bill-may-become-law-despite-judicial-order.php">debate among government officials</a> [JURIST report] that the law went into effect after it was published on the Wisconsin Legislative Bureau's website. The judge's temporary restraining order also stemmed from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed earlier this month by <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/daoffice/dahome.htm">District Attorney Ismael Ozanne</a> [official website] claiming that Republican legislators passed the bill in violation of Wisconsin's open meetings law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill had <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">passed the state legislature</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. The new law allows for limited exceptions to the ban, such as in the case of a risk of death or substantial physical injury to the mother or to another fetus. The signing was not accompanied by any press release or statement by the governor, who did tout the necessity of the bill <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/14/us-abortion-idaho-idUSTRE73D7AB20110414">despite a relatively small number</a> [Reuters report] of post-20 week abortions in the state. The bill became law despite an opinion from the state attorney general that the law is <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2011/04/14/1605933/otter-signs-20-week-fetal-pain.html">unconstitutional</a> [AP report].

<p>Idaho becomes the third state to ban abortions after the 20-week mark, following <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">Nebraska</a> [JURIST reports]. Several other states are considering similar measures. Last week, similar legislation was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Ohio Senate</a> and the <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama House of Representatives</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this month, the Iowa House of Representatives also <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would prohibit doctors from performing late-term abortions in the state. Last month, South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill also creates a new criminal offense of "aggravated identity fraud" which applies to anyone using fraudulent identifying information to obtain employment, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 fine. <a href="http://gov.georgia.gov/02/governor/home/0,2822,165937316,00.html;jsessionid=7D2ADC9542D4B58A04D02263E83562AE">Governor Nathan Deal</a> [official website] has indicated that he <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/exclusive-deal-tells-ajc-911061.html">intends to sign the bill into law</a> [AJC report]. Debbie Seagraves, Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.acluga.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia</a> [advocacy website], <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/georgia-legislature-passes-racial-profiling-law">condemned the bill</a> [press release]:<blockquote>This law undermines our core American values of fairness and equality and will make the rampant racial profiling of people of color that is already going on in Georgia that much worse, threatening the rights of citizens and non-citizens alike. Authorizing police to demand papers from people on the street is a tactic commonly associated with police states, not robust democracies.</blockquote> The ACLU contends that Arizona-style immigration laws run contrary to federal law and promote racial profiling.

<p><a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] have all enacted Arizona-style immigration laws within the past year. Nonetheless, these type of laws remain controversial. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/04/11/10-16645_opinion.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">enjoin several provisions</a> [JURIST report] of Arizona's controversial <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>].

In response, Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/arizona-governor-countersues-us-government-over-immigration-law.php">countersued</a> [JURIST report] the federal government alleging an infringement upon state rights.

According to the legislation, individuals entering into a civil union "shall enjoy all the same rights, benefits, protections, and shall be subject to all the same responsibilities, as married persons under Delaware law." The bill also provides that "the rights of parties to a civil union, with respect to a child of whom either party becomes the parent during the term of the civil union, shall be the same as the rights (including presumptions of parentage) of married spouses." The Senate voted 13-6 to pass the bill last week. Delaware <a href="http://governor.delaware.gov/">Governor Jack Markell</a> [official website] has indicated his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/04/14/us/AP-US-XGR-Civil-Unions.html?_r=2&ref=samesexmarriage">support for the bill</a> [NYT report], which will now pass to him for his signature and take effect January 1, 2012. Delaware would become the eighth state to allow civil unions for same-sex couples.

<p>Issues surrounding same-sex civil unions and marriages continue to be debated throughout the US. Earlier this month, Washington <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/">Governor Chris Gregoire</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/washington-governor-signs-bill-recognizing-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] recognizing out-of-state <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive] as legal domestic partnerships. House Bill 1649 <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014693141_apwaxgrdomesticpartnerships1stldwritethru.html">amends the current law</a> [AP report], which acknowledges out-of-state domestic partnerships and civil unions, but excludes same-sex marriage. The Senate approved the bill by a 28-19 vote after the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/washington-approves-bill-recognizing-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] by a similar margin. The bill will become effective 90 days after the close of the current legislative session. Also this month, the <a href="http://courts.state.ar.us/opinions/sc_opinions_list.cfm">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/arkansas-high-court-upholds-decision-to-strike-gay-adoption-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision invalidating a state ban on adoptions by same-sex couples. The court affirmed the decision of the Pulaski County Circuit Court invalidating <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/cole-v-arkansas-case-profile">Act 1</a> [ACLU backgrounder], a state law which prohibits all unmarried couples from adopting or fostering children in the state. The original suit was filed after the law was criticized for effectively denying all gay couples the right to adopt or foster a child because Arkansas does not recognize gay marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gotovina, along with former military leaders Ivan Cermak and Mladen Markac, had been on trial <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/former-croatian-generals-on-trial-at.php">since 2008</a> [JURIST report]. The men were charged as participants in "a joint criminal enterprise" aimed at the permanent removal of 200,000 Serbs from the Krajina region of Croatia. Gotovina was found guilty of eight counts including murder, plunder, persecution and deportation and sentenced to 24 years in prison. Markac was found guilty of the same offenses and sentenced to 18 years in prison. Cermak was acquitted on all counts. The judgment brought about mixed reactions. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/croatia-key-international-court-ruling-delivers-justice-victims-war-crimes-2011-04-">applauded the judgment</a> [statement] as "the first step to truth and justice for many victims of crimes committed during 'Operation Storm.'"

<p>The ICTY continues to hear cases regarding former military leaders in the region and accusations of war crimes committed during the 1990s. Proceedings against former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/13/radovan-karodzic-trial-prosecution-witness">resumed this week</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] after <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icty-suspends-karadzic-trial-for-6-weeks.php">multiple</a> <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/icty-delays-karadzic-trial-for-one-month.php">suspensions</a> [JURIST reports].

Mamdouh Habib, an Australian citizen, was arrested in Pakistan in 2001 following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US. He was <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/australian-guantanamo-detainee-freed.php">released from Guantanamo</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 without charges being filed against him, after being held at the detention facility for three years. Habib claims that he was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iPjCKSA2OkpFRRMsMfIGQZgJBjdw?docId=CNG.67b2bce99c17bd498c7a49736b665005.521">tortured and beaten</a> [AFP report] <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/australian-gitmo-detainee-says-us.php">after being taken to Egypt</a> [JURIST report] as part of the CIA's <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program. He claims Egypt's former vice-president Omar Suleiman and Mubarak's son Gamal supervised the torture, and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/04/15/3192845.htm">indicated that he is seeking compensation</a> [ABC report] and that he hopes those responsible will be imprisoned. Habib also indicated on Friday that he is <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/habib-seizes-new-evidence-on-australians/story-e6frg6nf-1226039933714">hoping to reopen a civil case</a> [<em>The Australian</em> report] against the Australian government alleging their complicity in his torture in Egypt. He settled a civil case against the Australian government last year, but new evidence provided by witnesses in Egypt and Pakistan may further implicate Australian officials in his torture. Habib previously claimed that he was <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/prostitutes-used-in-gitmo-torture.php">tortured while at the Guantanamo facility</a>, although a US military probe <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/us-military-probe-finds-no-abuse-of.php">found no evidence to support the allegations</a> [JURIST reports]. 

<p>Several other Guantanamo detainees have also filed lawsuits alleging torture. In October, former Guantanamo detainee Abdul Rahim Abdul Razak Al Ginco <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/former-guantanamo-detainee-suing-us-government-over-torture-allegations-report.php">filed a lawsuit against the US military</a> [JURIST report] alleging that he was subjected to torture. The suit names 26 current or former members of the military who are allegedly responsible for the tortuous acts, such as urinating on Ginco, slapping him, threatening him with loss of fingernails, sleep deprivation, extreme cold and stress positions. In July, the UK High court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-court-allows-ex-guantanamo-detainees-torture-suit-to-continue.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit filed by former Guantanamo Bay detainees alleging that the UK government was complicit in their torture to proceed. In April, former Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://projecthamad.org/">Adel Hassan Hamad</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-guantanamo-detainee-sues-us.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website] against the US government and more than a dozen government officials, claiming he was tortured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2006, Oren Adar and Mickey Ray Smith adopted their child in New York, where <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/new-york-governor-signs-law-allowing-unmarried-partners-to-adoption.php">unmarried couples can legally adopt</a> [JURIST report].  The child was born in Louisiana, and the state refused to issue a birth certificate naming both fathers.  The couple brought suit alleging Louisiana had violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art4frag1_user.html#art4_sec1">Full Faith and Credit Clause</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14i_user.html#amdt14i_hd8">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] of the US Constitution.  Rejecting the Full Faith and Credit argument, the court clarified that the clause only has compelling effects on state courts and not state officials.  Even if the situation were otherwise, the court explained:<blockquote>The Full Faith and Credit Clause was enacted to preclude the same matters being relitigated in different states as recalcitrant parties evade unfavorable judgments by moving elsewhere. It was never intended to allow one state to dictate the manner in which another state protects its populace.  Similarly, the full faith and credit clause does not oblige Louisiana to confer particular benefits on unmarried adoptive parents contrary to its law. Forum state law governs the incidental benefits of a foreign judgment. In this case, Louisiana does not permit any unmarried couples-whether adopting out-of state or in-state-to obtain revised birth certificates with both parents' names on them.</blockquote>The Court quickly disposed of the Equal Protection claim, finding that "adoption is not a fundamental right[,] ... Louisiana has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children, ... [and] Louisiana may rationally conclude that having parenthood focused on a married couple or single individual-not on the freely severable relationship of unmarried partners-furthers the interests of adopted children."

<p>The ruling overturns a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-orders-state-to.php">prior decision</a> [JURIST report] in February by a panel of three judges from the Fifth Circuit ordering that the revised birth certificate be issued.  <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website], which represented Adar and Smith, <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/federal-judge-rules-oklahoma-gay.php">successfully argued a similar case</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, when the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/finstuen-victory.html">struck down an amendment</a> [press release] to the Oklahoma Constitution that would have prevented the state from recognizing adoptions by gay parents that were finalized in other US or foreign jurisdictions. Same-sex adoptive parents have recently been involved in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=adoption">numerous legal battles</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this month, the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/arkansas-high-court-upholds-decision-to-strike-gay-adoption-ban.php">struck down a ban on adoptions</a> [JURIST report] by same-sex couples, finding the ban to be a violation of the state constitution. In September, a Florida appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/florida-appeals-court-strikes-down-gay-adoption-ban.php">struck down a similar law</a> [JURIST report], finding that it failed rational basis review and violated the state constitution's equal protection clause. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The order follows a <a href="http://www.cnnchile.com/nacional/2011/04/15/es-muy-doloroso-pero-importante-para-llegar-a-una-verdad-juridica/">request</a> [CNN video, in Spanish] for a new autopsy of the former president from Allende's daughter, Senator Isabel Allende, and other relatives who want to determine the causes of his death. Allende died in a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/11/newsid_3199000/3199155.stm">1973 coup</a> [BBC], in what has since been ruled a suicide. However, many human rights groups and Allende supporters question the suicide and believe he was killed by soldiers during the coup. The investigation into Allende's death is part of a <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.cl/modulos/Home/Noticias/PRE_txtnews.php?cod=2912&opc_menu=&opc_item=">larger probe into alleged human rights abuses under 1973-1990 military dictatorship</a> [press release, in Spanish] of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3758403.stm">General Augusto Pinochet</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/pinochet.php">news archive</a>], who seized power after the coup. The autopsy is expected take place later in May. 

<p>Allende, a Marxist, was met with opposition after winning the 1970 elections in Chile from those fearing his presidency would support a pro-Soviet communist government. The 1973 coup, <a href="/paperchase/2004/05/declassified-transcript-hints-at-us.htm">backed by the US</a> [JURIST report], was followed by a 17-year military regime lead by Pinochet. In an extraordinary statement released on his 91st birthday Pinochet publicly <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/pinochet-assumes-political.php">assumed "full political responsibility"</a> [JURIST report] for the actions of his military regime. Pinochet nonetheless justified the military coup against Allende that brought him to power as having being necessary to preserve Chile's integrity amid "the continuation and worsening of the worse political and economic crisis than one can remember." Pinochet <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/pinochet-dead-at-91-without-ever.php">died</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 at the age of 91 without ever facing trial for multiple human rights abuses and tax evasion charges against him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government is appealing last year's lower court decision that <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">prohibits the use of warrantless GPS technology</a> [JURIST report]. In that decision, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that prolonged use of GPS to monitor suspects' vehicles violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The government rejects the argument that using a GPS tracking system violates a suspect's reasonable expectation of privacy. This view hinges on the Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2281447873975736215&q=460+U.S.+276&hl=en&as_sdt=8000000002">United States v. Knotts</a> [opinion, PDF], which allowed for electronic surveillance in public based on a lower expectation of privacy on public roads. The Supreme Court's resolution on the issue, the Justice Department believes, is critical for future law enforcement decisions. 

<p>The use of GPS technology and other surveillance devices by law enforcement agents continue to be a controversial issue in the US, with courts across the country coming to divergent conclusions. Last week, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/wpcap.htm">Court of Appeals of Virginia</a> [official website] ruled that using a GPS device to track the movement of a suspect in a string of sexual assaults without obtaining a warrant did <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/virginia-appeals-court-rules-gps-tracking-of-sex-offender-did-not-violate-fourth-amendment.php">not violate the Fourth Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. A Pennsylvania appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/pennsylvania-appeals-court-allows-evidence-obtained-with-gps-technology.php">allowed use of evidence obtained with GPS technology</a> [JURIST report] in December. In September, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084227p.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that, at times, the government might <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/third-circuit-rules-warrant-may-be-required-to-collect-cell-phone-location-data.php">need a warrant to obtain cell phone data</a> [JURIST report] to track a person's location. Last year, the US Supreme Court unanimously held that, even if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in work-issued electronic devices, that an employer's <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">search of private text messages does not violate</a> [JURIST report] the Fourth Amendment so long as the search is not excessive and is pursuant to a legitimate work-related purpose. </p>]]></content:encoded>

At least 34 people, including women, were shot to death or trampled by military vehicles during the Iraqi military's April 8 operation at Camp Ashraf. The camp is composed of members of the <a href="http://www.mojahedin.org/pagesen/index.aspx">People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran</a> (PMOI) who seek to overthrow Iranian government officials. The Iraqi militants initiated the raid after Ashraf exiles allegedly <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/UN-rights-chief-urges-probe-into-Iraq-camp-deaths-1338653.php">threw rocks at soldiers</a> [AP report]. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] indicated that few measures are available for resolving the discord between the Iranian exile group and the Iraqi government:<blockquote>Everyone had been fearing a tragedy like this for a long time. I am well aware that this is a contentious group, with a complicated history, but leaving them to fester in Camp Ashraf was never going to be a solution. Clearly, since they are unable to go back to Iran, and are in danger in Iraq, the solution is most likely to involve moving them to third countries. I urge governments to take the necessary pragmatic and generous steps to resolve what is an untenable situation.</blockquote>Pillay also called for a "full, independent and transparent inquiry" into the military operation to ensure that those who exercised excessive force are prosecuted.

<p>The PMOI has been designated a foreign terrorist group by the US since 1997, but it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/16/AR2010071605881.html">stopped military action in 2001</a> [WP report], and, since 2003, has been without weapons. The group has also touted its actions in providing information about Iran's nuclear program. In July, a three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201007/09-1059-1255582.pdf">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF] the State Department to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-orders-us-to-reconsider-terror-label-for-iran-opposition-group.php">reconsider the status of the PMOI</a> [JURIST report]. In 2008, the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/presentation">European Court of First Instance</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-reverses-eu-decision-to.php">annulled a decision by the EU</a> [JURIST report] to place the PMOI on a list of terrorist groups. That decision followed an order by the UK Parliament to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/uk-parliament-removes-iranian-group.php">remove the PMOI from a British list of terrorist groups</a> [JURIST report]. PMOI is Iran's main political opposition organization and part of the <a href="http://www.ncr-iran.org/">National Council of Resistance of Iran</a> (NCRI) [group website], an umbrella coalition of Iranian opposition groups. The PMOI has been at odds with the Iranian government since it chose to support Saddam Hussein in the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm">Iran-Iraq war</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] during the 1980s.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Kazakh <a href="http://www.prokuror.kz/eng/">Prosecutor-General's Office</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/kazakhstan_supreme_court_judges_fired_corruption/3557709.html">opened criminal cases</a> [RFE/RL report] against the judges, who are suspected of corruption activity. The Kazakh <a href="http://www.finpol.kz/eng/">State Agency for Combating Economic Crimes and Corruption</a> [official website] approached Nazarbayev and <a href="http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&int_id=10&news_id=4219">asked him to remove the judges</a> [<em>Interfax</em> report]. Supreme Court Chairman Musabek Alimbekov resigned after the charges were filed. Senators voted unanimously to approve Nazarbayev's decision and subsequently approved the appointment of Bektas Beknazarov, chairman of the Aktobe Oblast Court, to replace Alimbekov.

<p>Human rights groups have closely scrutinized Kazakhstan's adherence to its international human rights obligations. Kazakhstan submitted to a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official websites] in February 2010. Kazakhstan <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/KZsession7.aspx">accepted 121 of the recommendations</a> [Kazakhstan UPR materials] to reduce human rights violation, particularly with respect to freedom of the press. In August 2009, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/kazahkstan-high-court-upholds-state.php">affirmed the conviction</a> of publisher Ramazan Esergepov, who was sentenced to three years in jail for revealing state secrets in his newspaper. A representative of <a href="http://www.osce.org/fom/">Freedom of the Media</a> at the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official websites] said that <a href="http://www.osce.org/fom/51228">revealing public corruption</a> [press release] is "the main duty of the journalists acting in the public interest," and that "[c]riminal sanctions for 'breach of secrecy' should only apply to the officials whose job descriptions stipulate the duty to protect sensitive information, but not to citizens."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement, which came in a nationally televised <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__lO3WeoXw4">address</a> [video], was seen as a progressive step for the country in the wake of political protests in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder]. During his speech, Bouteflika <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jMZe6w1o_DD2ULICRZ7q3O8APRMw?docId=CNG.24e3626329a6b1ddb097765004f72c76.e01">pledged to amend the constitution</a> [AFP report] and make changes to current electoral law, ensure fairness in the country's elections, and work to improve relations between opposing political parties before the presidential elections in 2014. Bouteflika also promised to <a href="http://www.siasat.com/english/news/algeria-president-pledges-political-reforms">improve media relations</a> [<em>Siasat Daily</em> report] in the country by introducing a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/790556.stm#media">new information law</a> [BBC backgrounder] that would decrease fines for defamation and allow the release of currently imprisoned journalists. Unlike other nations, the political protests in Algeria have been relatively small, local events in the capital city of Algiers. However, the political movements have been <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE73D0PG20110414">gaining strength</a> [Reuters report] in recent weeks.

<p>In February, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/algeria-government-to-lift-19-year-state-of-emergency.php">announced</a> the government will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/algeria-government-lifts-19-year-state-of-emergency.php">end the 19-year-old state of emergency laws</a> [JURIST reports] amidst growing protests in Algeria and the ongoing protests in Tunisia and Egypt. The state of emergency, which has been in place since a series of decrees in 1992, gave the government power to limit political freedoms and even peaceful protests. Opponents also claimed that the state of emergency gave rise to arbitrary detentions. Algeria has been under a state of emergency since 1992 when the military canceled elections fearing a win by religious fundamentalists. The <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm">state of emergency was declared</a> [DOS backgrounder] after it became apparent that the militant Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) would win control of the government. Bouteflika came to power, winning the presidency in 1999 with 70 percent of the official vote and appearing to have the backing of the military.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stem from allegations that the three former officials, all of which served under former Egyptian president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hosni+mubarak">news archive</a>], <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201141715562214192.html">granted a no-bid contract</a> [Al Jazeera report] to a German businessman to sell license plates in Egypt. The deal is alleged to have wasted USD $15 million of public funds by paying more for the plates than market price. The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/ml_egypt">businessman has also been charged</a> [AP report]. Nazif is already in prison, Adly is facing separate corruption charges and Boutros has left the country. The trial date has not been set. The charges come amid a wider effort by the ruling Egyptian <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> [NYT backgrounder] to dismantle the vestiges of Mubarak's government. The High Administrative Court on Saturday ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-court-dissolves-mubaraks-national-democratic-party.php">dissolution of Mubarak's former ruling party</a> [JURIST report]. The court also liquidated the party's assets.

<p>The decision came just days after the court ordered Mubarak moved to a hospital to recover from an unspecified ailment, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-postpones-questioning-after-mubarak-hospitalized.php">causing a delay in questioning</a> [JURIST report] regarding his alleged roles in protester deaths and embezzlement of government money.

Egyptian authorities <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itXAhyUDtvGI8GV0iOZ58GthpBeg?docId=CNG.10d3a9e29c2cbf7d2da3ebd746b3a9f1.8b1">continued to question Mubarak's sons</a> [AFP report] after Mubarak was taken to the hospital.

Bloomberg reports Besigye was <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/04/18/bloomberg1376-LJU5CB6JIJUP01-4N886O2MVGBQTELK76PBG19BAI.DTL">detained during the protest</a> [Bloomberg report], while Al Jazeera reports Besigye was <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/04/201141874445864220.html">arrested on his way to the protest</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Besigye has been charged with rioting and inciting violence, but was released on bail pending a court hearing. He <a href="http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/752360">must appear again in court</a> [NewVision report] on May 18. This is the third time that Besigye has been arrested in the last week in connection with protests&#8212;he was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13033279">also arrested on April 11</a> [BBC report] and <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/7526549.html">April 14</a> [AP report]. During the April 14 arrest Besigye was shot in the hand by a police officer. The protests at issue have been labeled the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Ugandas-Walk-To-Work-Protests-Will-Continue-says-Activist-120003879.html">"Walk to Work" protests</a> [VOA report], because participants refrain from taking motor vehicles to show their discontent over high fuel prices. Ugandan police reportedly resorted to using <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hgHGiVxr80SqByT7X7XwoT7gVuKQ?docId=CNG.f881ad1f6bfd84adda9227dce8764ef0.441">teargas to control the protesters</a> [AFP report], who were throwing stones at people in cars on Monday. 

<p>Besigye is the leader of the Uganda's most prominent opposition party, the <a href="http://www.fdcuganda.org/index.html">Forum for Democratic Change</a> [official website]. He lost to incumbent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1196167.stm">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [BBC profile] in elections held this past February. The elections were criticized by the opposition as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/20/ugandan-leader-wins-presidential-election">fraudulent</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Besigye also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11524243">ran for president</a> [BBC report] in 2002 and 2006, and, prior to that, he was Museveni's personal doctor. In October 2010, Uganda's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uganda-court-dismisses-treason-case-against-opposition-leader.php">unanimously dismissed treason charges</a> [JURIST report] against Besigye  and 10 co-defendants, ruling that there was insufficient evidence and that the state had violated the defendants' rights. Besigye had been <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/besigye-pleads-not-guilty-to-treason.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with plotting to forcefully overthrow the Ugandan government between 2001 and 2004 but had always maintained his innocence, calling the charges against him politically motivated. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last December, the founder and former chief executive of Parmalat, <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/424/000025349/">Calisto Tanzi</a> [NNDB profile], was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/italy-court-convicts-former-parmalat-owner-over-fraudulent-bankruptcy.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] along with 14 other former executives for the company's fraudulent bankruptcy.

Monday marked the second time the case of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-775.htm">Kiyemba v. Obama</a> [docket; CCR <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/kiyemba-v.-bush">backgrounder</a>], involving Chinese Muslim <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighers</a> [JURIST news archive] detained at Guantanamo and seeking an order of release into the US, came before the court. In October 2009, the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/supreme-court-to-hear-uighur-guantanamo.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] to determine whether it is within the power of the judicial branch to order the release of detainees into the US. However, after learning that the petitioners had received and rejected at least two offers of resettlement in other countries, in March 2010, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-sends-uighur-case-back-to.php">remanded</a> [JURIST report] the case to the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] with orders to reconsider it in light of these new developments. The court of appeals, which had originally decided that the law did not require the detainees' release into the US, found that no further proceedings were necessary and reinstated its prior opinion. Justice Stephen Breyer issued a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-775.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF] respecting Monday's denial in which he wrote:<blockquote>In my view, these offers, the lack of any meaningful challenge as to their appropriateness, and the Government's uncontested commitment to continue to work to resettle petitioners transform petitioners' claim. Under present circumstances, I see no Government-imposed obstacle to petitioners' timely release and appropriate resettlement. Accordingly, I join in the Court's denial of certiorari.</blockquote>Breyer was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor in issuing the statement. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in deciding the case.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-694.htm">Judulang v. Holder</a> [docket, <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/10-694.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court granted <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether a lawful permanent resident who was convicted by guilty plea of an offense that renders him deportable may seek a waiver of the conviction and thereby avoid removal under former section 212(c) of the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> (INA) [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the petitioner's request for a waiver, <a href="http://archive.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/memdispo.nsf/pdfview/091707/$File/06-70986.PDF">holding</a> [opinion, PDF] that his aggravated felony crime of violence was not a ground for exclusion under the statute. The court cited its decision in <span class="casename">Abebe v. Gonzalez</span> as controlling the issue. In that case, the court concluded that the lack of a substantially identical statutory counterpart in &#167; 212(a) for aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor among the grounds for exclusion rendered the alien ineligible for &#167; 212(c) relief.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/-/1064/1146636/-/item/0/-/ccp6y8/-/index.html">wishes to partially redact</a> [<em>Daily Nation</em>] portions of the evidence to be used against the six Kenyan leaders in order to protect the identity of witnesses so that they are not interfered with. The six men had been previously warned by the presiding judge when they <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-face-allegations-of-inciting-violence.php">first appeared before the ICC</a> [JURIST report] not to incite further violence in Kenya.

<p>The six defendants, called the "Ocampo Six," include several high-ranking members of Kenya's government, the head of operations at <a href="http://www.kassfm.co.ke/">Kass FM</a> [official website] in Nairobi and the son of Kenya's first president, <a href="http://www.africawithin.com/bios/jomo_kenyatta.htm">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [Africa Within backgrounder]. Three of the men are members of the <a href="http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website] and the other three are members of the opposing Party for National Unity (PNU). The ODM suspects are charged with fomenting violence against PNU members following the 2007 elections because they believed the election of Kenyan <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] to be rigged. In response, the PNU suspects are charged with the conspiring with the <a href="http://www.saferaccess.org/documents/The%20Mungiki%20-%20Cult%20Street%20Gang%20or%20Political%20Force.pdf">Mungiki criminal organization</a> [Safer Access backgrounder, PDF] to attack members of the ODM party. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summoned the suspects</a> [JURIST report] after determining they would not be charged in Kenya for the alleged crimes. Earlier this month, Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requested that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the government is capable of prosecuting the six men domestically. The Kenyan government also announced last month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/kenya-to-challenge-icc-summons.php">challenge the admissibility of cases</a> [JURIST report] relating to the post-election violence in the ICC, as well as the jurisdiction of the court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Members of the country's <a href="http://mszp.hu/">socialist party</a> (MSZP) [official website, in Hungarian] and <a href="http://lehetmas.hu/">green liberal political party</a> (LMP) <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/18/hungary-constitution-idUSLDE73H0TT20110418">boycotted the vote</a> [Reuters report]. The measure was supported by and passed as a result of the ruling <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Hungarian Civic Party</a> (FIDESZ) [official website, in Hungarian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fidesz">news archive</a>], which has controlled a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly since 2010. The constitution introduces several changes, including a debt ceiling where the country's debt cannot exceed 50 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP); a reform of the Fiscal Council, giving the group the right to veto the budget and dissolve parliament for failure to pass an annual budget by the end of March; a definition of marriage as a union between man and woman; and a statement that the life of a fetus begins at and should be protected from conception. The constitution also includes a new <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php?Cikk=161565">preamble</a> [text, in Hungarian], that condemns the communist and socialist climate in Hungary that existed from 1944 to 1990 and solidifies democratization that began 20 years ago. The Hungarian branch of <a href="http://amnesty.hu/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website, in Hungarian] sent a <a href="http://amnesty.hu/amnesty-international/emberi-jogaink/sajtokozlemeny-/-az-amnesty-international-aggodalmai-a-keszul%C5%91-alkotmannyal-kapcsolatban">letter</a> [text, in Hungarian] on Friday stating that the new constitution restricts human rights guaranteed in international treaties and erodes women's rights by including provisions regarding fetal protection. AI also charged that the definition of marriage encourages discrimination and prevents the possibility of marriage being extended to same sex-couples in the future. The new constitution is set to go into effect on January 1, 2012.

<p>Other laws passed by the FIDESZ-led parliament have garnered controversy as well. In February, the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hungary-agrees-to-change-controversial-media-law.php">agreed to change its controversial media law</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hungary-will-respond-to-eu-objections-over-strict-media-law.php">negotiations between Hungarian and EU representatives</a> [JURIST reports]. The law created the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites.  Under the law, the government could fine broadcasters more than 700,000 euros and newspapers and news websites roughly 90,000 euros if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the NMHH, made up of members loyal to FIDESZ. The law was approved in December 2010 and went into effect in January amid protests from members of the media, other European governments as well as AI, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urges-hungary-to-amend-new-media-law.php">urged Hungary to amend the law</a> [JURIST report] because it curtails freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US is also <a href="http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/50168/2011/04/18/General-Vides-Casanova-podria-ser-deportado-de-EE-UU-acusado-de-tortura">seeking to deport</a> [<em>La Pagina</em> report, in Spanish] Vides, who retired in Florida after completing his six-year term as defense minister. Vides, who was once supported by US government in his efforts to stop the spread of Communism in El Salvador, is allegedly responsible for many of the torturous acts carried out by the Salvadoran armed forces during the civil war that claimed more than 70,000 lives, including those of Americans. The US brought this case as the first against a foreign military officer who will face immigration charges by a special humans rights office at the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> [official site]. Supporters of the administration's decision encourage the step the US is taking to deal with foreigners who have committed humans rights abuses and then seek asylum on US soil. Vides has denied any involvement with the torture. The proceedings are expected to last about a week.

<p>In the past decade, the US has made significant strides in prosecuting those involved in the El Salvadoran civil war. In 2006, <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">$55 million verdict</a> [JURIST report] against Vides and his co-defendant Jose Guillermo Garcia for allowing torture and other human rights violations during the war. In 2005, a US federal court reached a verdict against Nicolas Carranza, top commander of El Salvador's security forces during the civil war, for <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/us-jury-finds-ex-salvadoran-colonel.php">$2 million in compensatory damages</a> [JURIST report]. The case was brought by five Salvadoran citizens who alleged torture or had family killed by Carranza's soldier during the war. In 2000, however, the US lost the  battle to seek justice for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/2-salvador-generals-cleared-by-us-jury-in-nuns-deaths.html?ref=joseguillermogarcia">murders of four American churchwomen</a> [NYT report] during the civil war when both Vides and Garcia were acquitted. The ruling was grounded in the doctrine that the generals, although responsible for their soldiers, may not have had complete effective power to reign in the abuses of their troops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The special panel, appointed by <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile], found that allegations of numerous war crimes and crimes against international humanitarian law asserted against both the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE warrant further investigation. The panel urged the support and cooperation of the government of Sri Lanka:
<blockquote>[T]he Government of Sri Lanka, in compliance with its international obligations and with a view of initiating an effective domestic accountability process, should immediately commence genuine investigations into these and other alleged violations of international humanitarians and human rights law committed by both sides involved in the armed conflict.</blockquote>If the allegations of the panel are proven, the Sri Lankan government could be held accountable for human rights violations. Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.parliament.lk/directory_of_members/ViewMember.do?memID=166">Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella</a> [official profile] rejected the UN report, calling it biased. The <a href="http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=23146">leaked excerpts</a> [materials] were printed in the Sri Lankan newspaper <em>The Island</em>, but the full report has not yet been made available to the public.

<p>In December, the <a href="http://www.slmfa.gov.lk/">Sri Lankan Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">UN panel would be allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to look into alleged war crimes in the final stages of the conflict with the LTTE. The decision signaled a reversal after months of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government under <a href="http://president.gov.lk/index.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who described the UN panel as an infringement of Sri Lanka's sovereignty. Rajapaksa appointed his own Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to investigate the final years of the conflict from the ceasefire in 2002 to its conclusion in 2009. Despite having its credibility contested by several human rights organizations, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-war-crimes-commission-begins-public-hearings.php">LLRC began public hearings</a> [JURIST report] in August with an appearance by <a href="http://www.defence.lk/main_abt.asp?fname=SoD">Sri Lanka Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/sri-lanka-defense-minister-defends-government-conduct-during-civil-war.php">defended the actions of the government</a> [JURIST report] during the conflict.

United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] to determine whether a district court may impose a longer prison sentence on a defendant to promote rehabilitation. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2010/04/16/09-50248.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the US District Court for the Southern District of California made no error when basing Alejandra Tapia's sentence on speculation that she could enter and complete the Bureau of Prison's <a href="http://www.bop.gov/inmate_programs/substance.jsp">500-hour drug abuse treatment program</a> [RDAP fact sheet text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has similarly held that a longer sentence to promote rehabilitation is permissible, but the US Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, Eleventh and DC Circuits have held that it is <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/10-05400qp.pdf">prohibited</a> [issue list, PDF]. Counsel for the petitioner argued that when enacting <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00003582----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 3582</a> [text], Congress did not intend to allow courts to send defendants to prison in order to get treatment, saying:<blockquote>When it instructed courts to recognize that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation, Congress intended to end the practice of sending defendants to prison so that they might get treatment. The commands of 3582 are clear on this point: Do no imprison and do not lengthen prison sentences for the purposes of rehabilitation. ... Under the statute, judges have the power to sentence defendants to prison but not to prison programs...[W]ith regard to revocation, to the extent that that's at issue, we concur with the Solicitor General that doesn't govern a revocation of supervised release because it's not the imposition of a term of imprisonment but, rather, requiring the individual to serve a portion of the supervised release term in prison. So, by its plain terms, it simply isn't applicable.</blockquote>Counsel for the government argued that "Section 3582(a) prohibits courts from imposing or lengthening a term of imprisonment to promote a defendant's rehabilitation, including by facilitating her access to a prison drug treatment program." In doing this however, Congress intended to reject the former rehabilitation model of sentencing where defendants were kept in prison until they were deemed rehabilitated, based on their participation in treatment programs. By forcing participation in programs, rehabilitation could not always be achieved in a prison setting. But if other goals of sentencing, like deterrence and protecting the public required a certain term of imprisonment, the court was free to impose it.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-290.pdf">Microsoft v. i4i Limited Partnership</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">report</a>], the court will determine whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode35/usc_sup_01_35.html">Patent Act</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 1-376 text] requires the invalidity defense to be proven by clear and convincing evidence. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit followed its precedent and <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/09-1504r.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that a challenger to a patent claim must prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. Additionally, the appeals court held that the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence as to damages or in granting enhanced damages. Counsel for the petitioner argued that the default standard of review is preponderance of the evidence, which governs all patent cases because 35 USC &#167; 282 "does not specify a heightened standard of proof ... therefore, preponderance, the default standard applies." Counsel further explained that:<blockquote>[I]t makes no sense to have a heightened standard of proof when the relevant prior art evidence was never even considered by [the Patent and Trademark Office]. Under any view, it was error to require clear and convincing proof of invalidity in this case. ... And, moreover, while the statute does not specify a heightened standard, it does actually speak to and preclude the argument that i4i makes. ... The statute requires a degree of deference by shifting the burden of proof and the burden of going forward, but for i4i to say that we need to go beyond what the presumption is, the normal default standard of preponderance, you need some heightened reason for that. There's absolutely none, particularly when the Patent Office didn't consider the evidence, didn't make a decision, there was no decision and no evidence considered going to the relevant question.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that "The long-settled, clear and convincing evidence standard is correct, one, as a matter of statutory interpretation, two, as a matter of stare decisis in a field in which stability is particularly important, and, three, as a matter of first principles." Counsel further explained that Congress is well aware of the clear and convincing evidence standard and has done nothing to change it, even though it has been very active in patent legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], includes 10 patent infringement charges, two trademark violations, two trade dress violations and accusations of unjust enrichment and unfair business practices. The complaint describes various physical and software features that are trademarked to Apple and are copied by Samsung, including the slim profile of the phones and the application icons. Samsung representatives have vowed to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110418/tc_nm/us_apple_samsung_lawsuit">defend against the suit</a> [Reuters report] and protect their intellectual property. Apple is seeking actual and punitive damages and an injunction to stop Samsung's alleged intellectual property violations.

This follows the Obama administration's February announcement that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend</a> [JURIST report] the law's constitutionality. The motion, which purports to be unopposed by the plaintiffs and by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] seeks to instate the House as a defendant for the limited purpose of defending DOMA's constitutionality. At issue is whether Section 3 of DOMA, which defines marriage as being between one man and one woman, violates the Fifth Amendment's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">due process and equal protection</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] requirements.

<p>Last month, Congressional Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced legislation that would repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report].

Additionally, the government passed a bill protecting the right to peaceful protests under the <a href="http://www.mideastinfo.com/documents/Syria_Constitution.htm">Syrian Constitution</a> [text], but also requiring demonstrators to receive government permission before protesting in public. Safar emphasized the need to improve communications between the Syrian government and its citizens, and the country's recent legislative actions may reflect the government's aim to promote democracy and protect citizens' rights. Pro-democracy <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/19/us-syria-protests-banias-idUSTRE73I44X20110419">demonstrators flocked the streets</a> [Reuters report] in the city of Banias following the government's decision to lift of the state of emergency. Thousands of Syrians have held demonstrations across the country calling for political reform, following similar movements across the Arab world.

<p>Last month, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-president-forms-committee-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">ordered the formation of a committee</a> [JURIST report] that evaluated possible elimination of the country's 48-year-old state of emergency law. The panel was composed of legal experts and charged with examining potential legislative measures that would simultaneously preserve national security and allow the revocation of the law, which permitted arrest without charge and banned political protests. The announcement may have been an effort to appease demonstrators, whose activity had recently increased, while also conveying that any future reforms would proceed at a gradual pace. In March, al-Assad announced that the government would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">consider ending the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. Also in March, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Connecticut</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-to-hear-wal-mart-gender-discrimination-global-warming-cases.php">report</a>] regarding whether electric utilities contributed to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22global+warming%22">global warming</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court is being asked to decide (1) whether states and private parties have standing to seek judicially-fashioned emissions caps on five utilities for their alleged contribution to harms claimed to arise from global climate change caused by more than a century of emissions by billions of independent sources; (2) whether a cause of action to cap carbon dioxide emissions can be implied under federal common law where no statute creates such a cause of action, and the Clean Air Act speaks directly to the same subject matter and assigns federal responsibility for regulating such emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency; and (3) whether claims seeking to cap defendants' carbon dioxide emissions at "reasonable" levels, based on a court's weighing of the potential risks of climate change against the socioeconomic utility of defendants' conduct, would be governed by "judicially discoverable and manageable standards" or could be resolved without "initial policy determination[s] of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion." The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in 2009 that <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/second-circuit-rules-states-may-sue.php">states can sue power companies for emitting carbon dioxide</a>, reversing a district court <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/environmental-brief-federal-judge.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] that found the plaintiffs' claim was a non-justiciable political question. The lawsuit was brought by eight states&#8212;California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin&#8212;as well as New York City and three land trusts, against coal-burning utilities <a href="http://www.aep.com/">American Electric Power</a>, <a href="http://www.southerncompany.com/">Southern Company</a>, <a href="http://www.xcelenergy.com/Company/Pages/Home.aspx">Xcel Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.duke-energy.com/residential.asp">Cinergy Corporation</a> [corporate websites] and the <a href="http://www.tva.gov/">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> [official website]. At oral argument Tuesday, the justices appeared skeptical of the states' arguments, implying that the Environmental Protection Agency would be better equipped to deal with emissions standards than federal courts. The Obama administration has sided with the power companies.]]></content:encoded>

Stewart</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that a state agency can sue state officials in federal court to remedy a violation of federal law. The <a href="http://www.vopa.state.va.us/">Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy</a> (VOPA) is an independent state agency that is a designated "protection and advocacy" (P&#38;A) system to protect and advocate for the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities under federal law. VOPA sought to force the disclosure of medical records from state officials relevant to the deaths of two individuals who were residents of state-run facilities. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court held that VOPA's action against state officials could proceed under the <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/209/123/case.html">Ex parte Young</a> [opinion text] doctrine. The court reasoned that the suit satisfies the inquiry under <span class="casename">Ex Parte Young</span> of whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law, seeks the proper relief and does not offend the distinctive interests protected by sovereign immunity. The opinion stressed that the proper inquiry for determining when a suit is in fact against the sovereign is the effect of the relief sought and not who is bringing the action.  The court rejected the respondents' claim that a state's dignity is diminished when a federal court adjudicates a dispute between its components, reasoning that VOPA's power to sue the state officials is a consequence of the Virginia's voluntary decision to establish a public P&#38;A. Additionally, the court reasoned that a state's stature is not diminished to any greater degree when its own agency sues to enforce its officers' compliance with federal law as opposed to a private person bringing a same type of action:<blockquote>Not every offense to a State's dignity constitutes a denial of sovereign immunity. The specific indignity against which sovereign immunity protects is the insult to a State of being haled into court without its consent; that does not occur just because a suit happens to be brought by another state agency.</blockquote> The opinion recognized the novelty of VOPA's action, but emphasized that the action contained the necessary elements to invoke the <span class="casename">Ex Parte Young</span>  exception. The dissent by Chief Justice John Roberts criticized the opinion of the court for expanding a narrow exception. The dissent argued that the majority's decision runs contrary to <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/527/706/">Alden v. Maine</a> [opinion text] where the court objected to the federal government forcing a state to defend itself before itself.  

<p>The opinion overturns the <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081845.P.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] that the suit by the petitioner was barred under the Eleventh Amendment and did not fall within the <span class="casename">Ex Parte Young</span> doctrine. The Fourth Circuit reasoned that a suit by a state agency against state officials is an intramural state dispute and to allow it to be brought in federal court would be inconsistent with our system of dual sovereignty. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-529.pdf">case</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] last year. </p>]]></content:encoded>

LaRue noted that, despite significant progress since the 1990s, which saw more than100 journalists killed, a number of challenges remain. LaRue highlighted that the television and radio sectors remain under government control and do not provide unbiased coverage. He also cautioned that the restrictive legal framework continues to impair important rights including peaceful assembly. LaRue urged continued political reform:<blockquote>The logic of the past can no longer be used to ignore the expectations of the youth and to limit their freedoms. People from all walks of life, in particular the youth, are now demanding their rights, including the right to freedom of expression, right to freedom of assembly, and basic economic, social and cultural rights, such as job opportunities. The Government should listen to such voices.</blockquote>LaRue did praise government efforts to provide Internet access to eight million through libraries and public centers.

<p>Last week, Algerian <a href="http://www.el-mouradia.dz/francais/president/biographie/Presidentfr.htm">President Abdelaziz Bouteflika</a> [official profile, in French] declared an initiative for <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/algeria-president-announces-constitutional-reforms-amid-political-protests.php">sweeping constitutional and political reforms</a> [JURIST report] in order to increase the role of democracy in the African nation. In February, the Algerian Council of Ministers approved a draft ordinance <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/algeria-government-lifts-19-year-state-of-emergency.php">repealing the country's 19-year state of emergency</a>, delivering on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/algeria-government-to-lift-19-year-state-of-emergency.php">promise made the week before</a> [JURIST reports] by Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci. The state of emergency gave the government power to limit political freedoms and even peaceful protests. Opponents also claimed that the state of emergency gave rise to arbitrary detentions. Algeria had been under a state of emergency since 1992 when the military canceled elections fearing a win by religious fundamentalists. The <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/8005.htm">state of emergency was declared</a> [DOS backgrounder] after it became apparent that the militant Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) would win control of the government. Bouteflika came to power, winning the presidency in 1999 with 70 percent of the official vote and appearing to have the backing of the military.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Among Kang's recommendations were to establish a Disappearances Commission and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate allegations of disappearance, torture and other crimes:<blockquote>Post-conflict amnesties cannot be granted to prevent prosecution of egregious human rights violations, including through pardons or the withdrawal of criminal charges. Transitional justice, and criminal justice, should work in a complementary fashion. In this regard, there are a number of cases currently pending in Nepal, for which police investigations, and judicial proceedings, should continue regardless of the fact the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms remains a priority. It is deeply troubling that to date in Nepal no-one has been held accountable for crimes committed during the conflict. Criminal investigations have not moved forward, some perpetrators have even been promoted, and little action has been taken to address and redress the grievance of the victims.</blockquote>Although Kang was pleased that Nepal is considering criminalizing untouchability practices, she decried that "a number of current draft provisions do not protect basic rights, such as the right to equality. Here, I note particularly gender-based discrimination ... and inadequate respect for the rights of non-citizens." Kang and others are reportedly <a href = "http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=UN+official+concerned+about+violations&NewsID=284703">considering extending</a> [<em>Himalayan Times</em>] the <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/asiaregion/pages/npindex.aspx">OHCHR-Nepal</a> [official website] presence in the country for two additional years.

<p>The decade-long Maoist guerrilla insurgency that left more than 13,000 people dead <a href = "/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] in late 2006 when the Nepalese government signed a peace agreement that established the CA.

Bushishi is accused of using his role as prosecutor to assist in the extermination of Tutsis in the city of Butare during the genocide.

No trustee in this situation, including the government, is entitled to withhold the legal advice that it has received about managing the beneficiary's money.

Accompanied by Italian officials, <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/148-adil-mabrouk-bin-hamida">Abdel Ben Mabrouk</a> [NYT materials] was taken by plane to his native country under an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gtSjFbTRnVUpQFHIUAcfM9VQPjaQ?docId=6618453">agreement with Tunisian diplomats</a> [AP report] brokered in Rome. Mabrouk was transferred to Italy in 2009 as part of US efforts to shut down the prison at Guantanamo, where he spent eight years as a suspected terrorist after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Having lived in Italy before traveling to Afghanistan, Mabrouk was returned to the Italian government, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-court-orders-release-of-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">imposed a two-year suspended sentence</a> [JURIST report] for terrorist association. The judge based the sentence on recommendations from Mabrouk's lawyer and prosecutor Armando Spataro, finding that Mabrouk's time served at Guantanamo and the year he spent in an Italian prison were sufficient punishment. Italian intelligence broke up the group with which Mabrouk was associated after thwarting several of its terrorist plots, including a plan to blow up the famous Milan Cathedral with a car packed with explosives.

<p>The continued operation of Guantanamo Bay remains controversial. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized US President Barack Obama</a> in January for failing to shut down the facility, as Obama's <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">stated desire to close the Guantanamo prison</a> [JURIST reports] has faced heavy opposition in Congress. Earlier in January, Obama signed a bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees</a> [JURIST report] to the US for trial. The legislation authorized funding for defense interests abroad, military construction and national security-related energy programs and barred the use of funds to transfer detainees into the US and limited funds available for transfers to foreign countries. The number of detainees at Guantanamo has been significantly reduced as the administration continues to transfer detainees to a growing list of countries including <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/germany-agrees-to-accept-two-guantanamo-detainees.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/italy-agrees-to-take-two-more-guatanamo-detainees.php">Italy</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-accepts-second-guantanamo-detainee-1.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/the-maldives-offers-to-accept-guantanamo-detainees.php">Maldives</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">Albania</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/latvia-to-accept-guantanamo-detainee.php">Latvia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-uzbek-guantanamo-detainee.php">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-transfers-3-guantanamo-detainees-to.php">Slovakia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-transfers-12-more-guantanamo.php">Somaliland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/six-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Palau</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/belgium-accepts-guantanamo-bay-detainee.php">Belgium</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/guantanamo-detainee-jawad-repatriated.php">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/four-uighur-guantanamo-detainees.php">Bermuda</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court said that officials who are aware of the practice before or after it occurs and do not report it will face criminal charges. Officials who fail to report perpetrators of the practice will be held directly or indirectly responsible for the crime. Additionally, criminal proceedings will be initiated against individuals who participate in honor killing. The case involved an altercation between two individuals regarding the proper method of tying bullocks. After a verbal insult was directed towards him by the victim, the accused assaulted the victim with sticks causing a fracture on his head. The two parties belong to different castes in India. The court stated: <blockquote>There is nothing honourable in honour killing or other atrocities and, in fact, it is nothing but barbaric and shameful murder. Other atrocities in respect of personal lives of people committed by brutal, feudal minded persons deserve harsh punishment. Only in this way can we stamp out such acts of barbarism and feudal mentality. Moreover, these acts take the law into their own hands, and amount to kangaroo courts, which are wholly illegal.</blockquote>The practice of parents killing their children is <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/04/20/idINIndia-56467820110420">most common</a> [Reuters report] when the person enters into a relationship with a member of a different caste or religion.

<p>Last June, the Supreme Court of India ordered the central government and seven state governments to <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/india-high-court-orders-government-to-explain-action-on-honor-killings.php">explain the steps they have taken to reduce honor killings</a> [JURIST report].

Texas</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder] that states do not consent to waive their sovereign immunity to private suits for money damages under the <a href="http://www.rluipa.com/index.php/article/398.html">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLUIPA) [42 USC &#167; 2000cc, text].  Petitioner Harvey Sossamon sought injunctive and monetary relief from the state of Texas under RLUIPA for prison policies that prohibited him from using the prison chapel for worship. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, rejected Sossamon's argument that the words "appropriate relief" in RLUIPA unambiguously waives the state's immunity from damages. Thomas stated that because "appropriate" is context dependent, "appropriate relief" is open-ended and ambiguous about the relief it includes. The court declined to consider a state to have waived its sovereign immunity where a statute can be inferred to have several plausible interpretations. Thomas also rejected Sossamon's contention that because RLUIPA &#167; 3 was enacted pursuant to the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Spending Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution, the states were on notice that they would be liable for damages because Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract, and damages are always available for breach of contract:<blockquote>Applying ordinary contract principles here would also make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique: They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance. More fundamentally, Sossamon's implied-contract remedy cannot be squared with the rule that a sovereign immunity waiver must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the relevant statute's text. </blockquote>The court also rejected Sossamon's attempt to apply &#167; 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986's express waiver of state sovereign immunity for violations of any federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of federal financial assistance. Thomas argued that RLUIPA &#167; 3, which prohibits substantial burden on religious exercise, is not unequivocally a statute explicitly prohibiting discrimination within &#167; 1003's meaning. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the dissent, and maintained that monetary damages are the usual remedy for violation of a legal right under the general remedies principles and included in the phrase "appropriate relief." Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision. 

<p>The court's ruling affirms the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/08-1438_ca5.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] that Sossamon was barred from suing for monetary damages because the language in RLUIPA did not provide clear notice to Texas that it was waiving its rights to sovereign immunity from monetary damages. The court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1438.pdf">oral arguments</a> [oral argument transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-violent-video-game-law.php">report</a>] in the case last year. At oral arguments counsel for Sossamon argued that damages were an appropriate remedy. Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the petitioner. Counsel for Texas argued that the ambiguous phrase "appropriate relief" does not permit damages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice Kenneth Parker dismissed four of the five <a href="http://www.btplc.com/newsadmin/attachments/statement%20of%20facts%20and%20grounds.pdf">challenges</a> [claim, PDF] brought in July by UK Internet service providers (ISPs) <a href="http://www.btplc.com/">BT Group PLC</a> and <a href="https://sales.talktalk.co.uk/product/broadband/?portalId=TALKTALK">TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC</a> [corporate websites], including claims that the bill was not given adequate scrutiny before its passage and that it may require certain amendments in order to comply with EU rules on privacy and policing by ISPs. Parker sustained the remaining challenge, which questions a provision that requires ISPs to pay 25&#37; of the monitoring costs. The ruling allows the DEA to proceed toward entering effect, though officials are expected to reevaluate the funding sources. The court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-court-to-review-controversial-online-copyright-infringement-act.php">agreed to review</a> [JURIST report] the matter in November.

<p>Last year, the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">UK Parliament</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/uk-parliament-passes-anti-piracy-law.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] authorizing the suspension of Internet service for those who repeatedly download copyrighted material illegally. The act also received <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/100408-0013.htm#10040856001075">Royal Assent</a> [text] and is now law. It calls on ISPs to block download sites, reduce a user's broadband speeds and ultimately shut down a user's Internet access in order to prevent piracy of copyrighted materials. The bill, known as a three-strikes law, imposes stricter penalties on repeat digital offenders than had previously existed, and has received a great deal of public criticism. Despite the controversy over the legislation, MPs who support it say that it is a necessary step to protect the creators of digital content. In November, UK <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] announced that Britain's <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/uk-prime-minister-announces-intellectual-property-reforms.php">intellectual property laws would undergo a review</a> [JURIST report] with an eye towards modernization, in an effort to encourage innovation and small business. Cameron suggested that the law may be reformed in order to allow for increased use of copyright material without the owner's permission. The announcement, seen as an attempt to restore balance after the controversial DEA, was cheered by Internet freedom campaigners and small businesses alike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the <a href="http://www.alde.eu/">Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe</a> [official website], wrote in his request that the review would "ensure that the text does not contradict the basic European values of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights."

The constitution introduces several changes, including a debt ceiling where the country's debt cannot exceed 50 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP); a reform of the Fiscal Council, giving the group the right to veto the budget and dissolve parliament for failure to pass an annual budget by the end of March; a definition of marriage as a union between man and woman; and a statement that the life of a fetus begins at and should be protected from conception. The constitution also includes a new preamble that condemns the communist and socialist climate in Hungary that existed from 1944 to 1990 and solidifies democratization that began 20 years ago.</p>]]></content:encoded>

His attorneys, who had worked without pay, argued that a retrial was an economic hardship and an unnecessary drain on taxpayer funds. Beyond suggesting that the request was made primarily to arouse public attention, the judge clarified the motion was improperly presented and, therefore, could not be ruled upon. Blagojevich's defense team was granted additional time to file a proper motion, even though the court predicts the issue will dissipate with time. If convicted of making false statements to the FBI, Blagojevich faces a maximum five-year prison sentence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The law allows abortions past the 20-week mark only in certain extenuating circumstances where the mother faces death or serious injury. The legislation is based on evidence suggesting that a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/10/us-oklahoma-abortion-idUSTRE7290C420110310">fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks</a> [Reuters report] and would require doctors to measure the age of a fetus before performing an abortion. A doctor who performs an abortion in violation of the time limit would be subject to criminal prosecution for a felony, but there would be no penalty for the woman undergoing the procedure. The bill includes additional provisions allowing civil suits to be filed for "actual damages" against the doctor by a woman upon whom an abortion is attempted or performed or by the father of the unborn child. Fallin also signed <a href="http://www.oklegislature.gov/BillInfo.aspx?Bill=SB547">Senate Bill 547</a> [materials], according to which women can only receive coverage for elective abortions from health insurance providers through the payment of a supplemental fee. According to the bill, non-elective abortions only extend to live-saving abortions, <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&articleid=20110414_19_A1_OKLAHO871280">not abortions sought to due incest, rape or medical conditions</a> [<em>Tulsa World</em> report]. This legislation is reportedly intended to prevent insurance subscribers from unwittingly subsidizing abortions. "I believe in the sanctity of human life and the responsibility of our lawmakers to protect life," said Governor Fallin. "Together, these two pieces of legislation will expand protections for unborn children and ensure that Oklahomans are not forced to unknowingly or unwillingly help to pay for procedures that run contrary to their values."

<p>Oklahoma becomes the fourth state to ban abortions after the 20-week mark, following <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks-of-pregnancy.php">Idaho</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/nebraska-passes-law-banning-abortions.php">Nebraska</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this month, the Alabama House of Representatives voted 69-19 to approve a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">bill that would ban abortion</a> [JURIST news report] after 20 weeks of gestation, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk or she faces serious injury. Also in April, the Ohio Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would limit the availability of abortions after 20 weeks.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontguantanamosign.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced Wednesday that high-value <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive] will be subject to capital charges and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=63632">tried in a military court</a> [press release]. According to the Pentagon, the chief prosecutor for the DOD's <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissions.html">Office of Military Commissions</a> [official website] plans to charge al-Nashiri with orchestrating the 2000 attack on the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22USS+Cole%22">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archive] that left 17 dead and 40 injured. The office will also bring charges in connection with an attack that same year on a French oil freighter that claimed the life of one crewmember and spilled 90,000 barrels of oil into the Gulf of Aden. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/obama-administration-will-use-broken-military-commissions-system-try-suspect-uss-c">criticized</a> [press release] the DOD's decision to use a military tribunal, calling the system "broken."  ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi said the case is especially troubling given the looming threat of capital punishment:<blockquote>We are deeply disturbed that the Obama administration has chosen to use the military commissions to try a capital case in which much of the evidence is reportedly based on hearsay and therefore not reliable enough to be admissible in federal court. Allowing hearsay is a backdoor way of allowing evidence that may have been obtained through torture</blockquote>The announcement comes after <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-administration-not-bringing-charges-against-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-wp.php">reports emerged</a> [JURIST report] last August indicating that the Obama administration would not pursue a military trial for al-Nashiri, a move the ACLU said <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/delays-al-nashiri-case-underscore-unfairness-military-commissions-says-aclu">demonstrates the "inherent unfairness of the military commissions"</a> [press release]. The DOD refuted the reports at the time.

<p>Complicating the prosecution is the controversial history of al-Nashiri's detention. Former <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] agents <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,717166,00.html">confirmed</a> [Spiegel report] in 2010 the existence of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+secret+prisons">secret CIA black site</a> [JURIST news archive] in Poland, where al-Nashiri was allegedly waterboarded and subjected to mock executions. According to one agent, al-Nashiri was stripped naked and hooded before a gun and a drill were held close to his head. The allegations led the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">launch an abuse investigation</a> [JURIST report] in September 2010. Section 948r of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/2009%20MCA%20Pub%20%20Law%20111-84.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2009</a> [text, PDF] prohibits the use in military courts of evidence obtained through "torture or cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment," a provision that could implicate potential limitations on the prosecutors' ability to use certain evidence if it can be established that al-Nashiri was subjected to such treatment in Poland or at Gitmo. Former Polish prime minister Leszek Miller <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-ex-pm-denies-knowledge-of-cia-secret-prison.php">denied any knowledge of such a facility</a> [JURIST report]. Most recently, Polish prosecutors, who <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php">began investigating</a> the potential existence of the Polish CIA prison in 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/poland-prosecutors-ask-us-to-question-guantanamo-detainees-over-secret-cia-prison.php">asked US officials</a> [JURIST reports] last month to question al-Nashiri and fellow detainee Abu Zubaydah about the existence of the facility, saying their testimony was essential to establishing its existence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In several <a href = "http://www.sana.sy/eng/21/2011/04/21/342711.htm">decrees</a> [text] issued Thursday, al-Assad also abolished the Supreme State Security Court (SSSC), developed <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/node/80952/">in the wake of the state of emergency</a> [HRW report] to prosecute those deemed a threat to security, and legalized peaceful protest demonstrations, although they must be approved the Ministry of the Interior. The <A href = "http://www.nohr-s.org/new/">National Organization for Human Rights in Syria</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] reported that the <a href = "http://www.nohr-s.org/new/2011/04/21/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%87%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7/">government is not enforcing the new laws</a> [press release, in Arabic] and government violence continues:<blockquote>With deep conviction and condemnation, the Syrian authorities continue to use excessive force and violence to disperse a number of peaceful assemblies to isolate the Syrian citizens on 20/04/2011, in a number of provinces and cities in Syria, which led to the occurrence of a number of victims, in addition to the arbitrary arrests by the Syrian authorities against some of the Syrian citizens who had gathered peacefully, despite the announcement of the decision to lift state of emergency and the law of peaceful assembly.</blockquote>The government has <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2011/apr/19/libya-middle-east-syria-gaddafi-misrata">warned citizens not to take to the street</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the wake of the announcement, and some forces have reportedly been taking aggressive action against student protesters. Protesters do not appear appeased, as more protests are scheduled to <a href = "http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-21/assad-lifts-syrian-emergency-law-abolishes-security-court.html">coincide with Friday prayers</a> [Bloomberg report]. 

<p>Last month, al-Assad <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/syria-president-forms-committee-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">ordered the formation of a committee</a> [JURIST report] that evaluated possible elimination of the country's 48-year-old state of emergency law. The panel was composed of legal experts and charged with examining potential legislative measures that would simultaneously preserve national security and allow the revocation of the law, which permitted arrest without charge and banned political protests. The announcement may have been an effort to appease demonstrators, whose activity had recently increased, while also conveying that any future reforms would proceed at a gradual pace. In March, al-Assad announced that the government would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">consider ending the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report]. Also in March, UN <a href = "http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Otter cited the authority of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text] in support of the argument that the federal government has overstepped its bounds in regulating health care:<blockquote>PPACA represents a dramatic attempt to assert federal command and control over this country's health care system ... the power to require or regulate a person's choice in the mode of securing health care services. Require employers to provide health insurance coverage to their employees, determine the content of health insurance policies or limit the construction or expansion of the hospital or medical facilities or to impose a penalty related thereto, is not found in the United States Constitution.</blockquote>The order was issued after Otter vetoed <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/H0298.pdf">House Bill 298</a> [text, PDF] which would have nullified the federal law's application in the state. In a <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/pdf/House%20Bill%20298%20Veto%20Letter%202011.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to <a href="http://www.sos.idaho.gov/">Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa</a> [official website], Otter explained that he supports repeal of PPACA, but that he vetoed the bill out of concern that it would effectively prohibit the state from creating its own insurance exchange program. 

<p>Idaho is one of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">group of states</a> [JURIST report] which joined in a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">suit against the federal government</a> [JURIST report] filed in March 2010 in the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] alleging that PPACA is unconstitutional. The judge in that case <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the law. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] appealed the ruling, and the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] has agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/11th-circuit-agrees-to-expedited-health-care-appeal.php">hear the case on expedited review</a> [JURIST report]. The health care reform law is the subject of numerous other legal challenges across the country. Last month, <a href="http://www.vaag.com/index.html">Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli</a> [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">petition for a <em>writ of certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=us+supreme+court">Supreme Court</a> [JURIST news archive] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] rules on the issue. In January, a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled that the law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The petition seeks review of an August <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/tenth-circuit-finds-memorial-crosses-along-highways-unconstitutional.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/clerk/opinions.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website], which found that "the cross memorials would convey to a reasonable observer that the state of Utah is endorsing Christianity." The memorials in question, erected in 1998 by the <a href="http://www.utahtrooper.com/">Utah Highway Patrol Association</a> (UHPA) [official website], consist of 14 12-foot-high cross memorials displaying the fallen troopers' name, rank, badge number and the official UPH symbol. The memorials were paid for with private funds, but most were placed on public land. Former Texas solicitor general Ted Cruz, <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.utah.gov/PR_042011.html">representing Utah</a> [press release] <em>pro bono</em>, argues that the lower court improperly applied the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to "passive public displays" and erroneously deemed the memorials "government speech." Discussing inconsistent precedent, the brief states:<blockquote>This confusion has generated a three-way circuit split and lower-court disarray regarding the proper test for evaluating Establishment Clause challenges to passive displays on government property. ... In short, the Tenth Circuit's approach, if allowed to stand, will prohibit the government from accommodating public displays of religious symbols, forbid a widely embraced means of commemorating fallen heroes on public property, and manifest an unconstitutional hostility toward religion.</blockquote>Representatives for <a href="http://www.atheists.org/">American Atheists</a> [advocacy website], the organization that brought the original suit, <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/texas/utah-asks-us-supreme-court-to-hear-crosses-1421130.html?cxtype=rss_texas">expressed doubt</a> [AP report] that the petition will be granted.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-national-day-of-prayer.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional challenge to the <a href="http://nationaldayofprayer.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> (NDP) [official website], overturning an earlier <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/doj-to-appeal-ruling-finding-national.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST report] that found the event in violation of the Establishment Clause by representing government-backed encouragement that Americans engage in non-secular activity. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-rules-on-religious.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] last April in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-472">Salazar v. Buono</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the lower courts were wrong to ban the government from transferring public land containing a religious symbol to a private entity. The dispute concerned a Latin cross on a rock outcropping in the Mojave National Preserve. The display of the cross on public property had already been found in violation of the Establishment Clause, so the government sought to transfer the portion of land on which the cross was located to a private entity. Last March, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a teacher-led <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/ninth-circuit-upholds-pledge-of.php">recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance</a> [JURIST report] in public schools does not violate the Constitution's Establishment Clause. The court also upheld the use of the phrase "In God We Trust" on currency. In November 2009, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that a school district's policy prohibiting the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/third-circuit-upholds-school-ban-on.php">performance of religious holiday songs</a> [JURIST report] does not violate the Establishment Clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The use of cluster bombs and heavy artillery by armed forces under leader <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] in the city of Misrata has resulted in "substantial" civilian casualties, including women and children. Pillay expressed concern over reported sniper attacks targeting civilians, mortar attacks around medical facilities and an inability to deliver medical aid to reach the victims of the conflict. Pillay warned that the government's actions will be under intense scrutiny by the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">International Criminal Court investigation</a> [JURIST report] and urged the government to cease the attack on Misrata:<blockquote>Under international law, the deliberate targeting of medical facilities is a war crime, and the deliberate targeting or reckless endangerment of civilians may also amount to serious violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law. </blockquote> Pillay also expressed hope that the presence of human rights investigators and a constant media presence will help to dispel the situation in Libya. 

<p>Earlier this month, the UN announced that investigators would enter Libya to begin looking into <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-to-investigate-alleged-human-rights-abuses-in-libya.php">alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by both rebels and the armed forces of Gaddafi.

Judge Freda Wolfson dismissed the lawsuit, brought without an attorney by two New Jersey residents, on jurisdictional grounds, ruling the two men had no <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing">standing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to challenge the health care reform law. The plaintiffs alleged that the PPACA violates numerous Constitutional provisions and conflicts with several federal statutes, but could not establish that they were or would be in any way injured by any of the law's provisions. Wolfson noted in her opinion:<blockquote>The Court is compelled to note that although Plaintiffs claim to represent "We the People" and the "citizens of the State of New Jersey," ... Plaintiffs are not attorneys and this lawsuit has not been brought as a class action. Moreover, no individual signed the Complaint other than the named Plaintiffs. Thus, the Court considers this as a challenge to the Act brought solely on behalf of the two individual Plaintiffs.</blockquote>Defendants <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/secretary/index.html">Kathleen Sebelius</a>, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/about/Pages/Secretary.aspx">Timothy Geithner</a> and <a href="http://www.dol.gov/_sec/welcome.htm">Hilda Solis</a> [official websites], individually and in their official government capacities, were granted a motion to dismiss the complaint without oral argument.

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Idaho <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/index.html">Governor CL "Butch" Otter</a> (R) [official website] issued an executive order <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-governor-blocks-implementation-of-federal-health-care-law.php">prohibiting implementation of the PPACA</a> [JURIST report] in the state. Idaho is one of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">group of states</a> [JURIST report] which joined in a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">suit against the federal government</a> [JURIST report] filed in March 2010 in the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] alleging that PPACA is unconstitutional. The judge in that case <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the law. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] appealed the ruling, and the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] has agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/11th-circuit-agrees-to-expedited-health-care-appeal.php">hear the case on expedited review</a> [JURIST report]. The health care reform law is also the subject of numerous other legal challenges across the country. Last month, <a href="http://www.vaag.com/index.html">Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli</a> [official website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">petition for a <em>writ of certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=us+supreme+court">Supreme Court</a> [JURIST news archive] asking the court to rule on the constitutionality of the law on an expedited basis, before the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] rules on the issue. In January, a judge for the US District Court for the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a provision of the health care reform law. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled that the law is constitutional</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause as it addresses the economic effects of health care decisions, and that it does not represent an unconstitutional direct tax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aclu-sues-montana-for-recognition-of-same-sex-civil-unions.php">filed in July</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aclu.org%2F&rct=j&q=ACLU&ei=o36xTcHaHsahtwesm8GDDA&usg=AFQjCNFkW0bpKZYAqodZrAfRg3ZiGyNpkA&sig2=RqNssaTxLfZUhPwW0u0cGQ&cad=rja">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] in Montana's <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/locator/dist1.mcpx">First Judicial District Court</a> [official website] on behalf of seven same-sex couples, had alleged that the state has limited the couples' decision-making powers regarding their health care and finances and had sought for the state to <a href="http://www.aclumontana.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=156:aclu-sues-for-domestic-partnerships&catid=3:rightnews">provide a legal status to same-sex couples</a> [case materials] that would confer the same rights and obligations as marriage. Montana <a href="http://www.doj.mt.gov/department/attorneygeneralbiography.asp">Attorney General Steve Bullock</a> [official profile] in November <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/montana-ag-moves-to-dismiss-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">moved to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the lawsuit, arguing that the plaintiffs were not failing to receive protections because they were gay, but because they were not legally married, and that they received the same rights as all other non-married Montanans. District Judge Jeffrey Sherlock said Tuesday that, while he was sympathetic to the personal experiences of the plaintiffs, it is the role of the legislature to change state law:<blockquote>This Court, in the past, has been willing to exercise its judicial power when it found a violation of the Montana Constitution as it related to a specific statute applying to gay people. ... However, what Plaintiffs want here is not a declaration of the unconstitutionality of a specific statute or set of statutes, but rather a direction to the legislature to enact a statutory arrangement. This Court finds Plaintiffs' proposal, although appealing, to be unprecedented and uncharted in Montana law.</blockquote> Sherlock added that a ruling in favor the plaintiffs would have violated a voter-approved amendment to the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&sqi=2&ved=0CCcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcourts.mt.gov%2Fcontent%2Flibrary%2Fdocs%2F72constit.pdf&rct=j&q=Montana%20Constitution&ei=oYSxTebHJ4K5twft-73_Cw&usg=AFQjCNFYPVvVHFkPHdkAzTQZzU1EIsPQgQ&sig2=tUcgtWj-sLHW3D7BGWb23A&cad=rja">Montana Constitution</a> [text, PDF] that defined marriage as between a man and woman. The ACLU, which argues that the same-sex couples should receive equal rights as opposite-sex couples under the equal protection clause of the state constitution, has 60 days to appeal the decision. 

<p>Other states continue to debate the legality of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same+sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive].

The suits, filed in South Korea, Japan and Germany, may be retaliation for <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/apple-sues-samsung-for-patent-infringement.php">infringement suits filed by Apple</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung last week. The two companies are significant competitors in the mobile phone and tablet markets, and Samsung alleges that Apple has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/22/us-samsung-apple-idUSTRE73L0DG20110422">infringed its technology</a> [Reuters report] related to energy consumption and preventing data transmission errors. After filing the lawsuit against Samsung, Apple indicated a <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/computer/232972/samsung-crossed-the-line-apple-executive">willingness to continue working with Samsung</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] as a partner, but it is not clear if the three suits filed by Samsung will change Apple's approach.

<p>Apple has also been embroiled in litigation with Nokia marked by trading accusations of patent infringement. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/nokia-files-new-round-of-patent-suits-against-apple.php">Nokia filed actions against Apple</a> [JURIST report] in the International Trade Commission and a court in Delaware, accusing Apple of violating seven patents. In December, the litigation spread to Germany, the UK and the Netherlands where <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/nokia-sues-apple-in-europe-for-patent-infringement.php">Nokia filed 13 patent infringement complaints</a> [JURIST report] against Apple. Last May, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/nokia-sues-apple-for-alleged-ipad-patent-infringements.php">Nokia filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court in the Western District for Wisconsin alleging that Apple iPad and iPhone 3G products infringe additional Nokia patents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The news comes shortly after an Egyptian court's decision to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/21/hosni-mubarak-name-to-be-removed">remove Mubarak's name</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], along with his wife's, from all public buildings in the nation. Estimates range in the thousands as to how many subway stations, schools, streets, squares and libraries bear the former leader's name. There have been conflicting reports over Mubarak's current health, but he <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/Mubaraks-detention-extended-may-be-shifted-to-prison/articleshow/8058632.cms">appears to be in unstable condition</a> [<em>Times of India</em> report]. Mubarak was previously moved to a hospital to recover from an unspecified ailment, causing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-postpones-questioning-after-mubarak-hospitalized.php">delay in questioning</a> [JURIST report] regarding his alleged roles in protester deaths and embezzlement of government money. Investigators have been interrogating Mubarak by visiting his temporary home in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh to question him.

<p>Last week, an Egyptian court ordered that Mubarak's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-court-dissolves-mubaraks-national-democratic-party.php">political party be dissolved</a> [JURIST report]. It would be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/16/us-egypt-politics-idUSTRE73F11X20110416">illogical</a> [Reuters report] for Mubarak's National Democratic Party, which took control in 1978, to remain an entity, the country's High Administrative Court said. The court also liquidated the party's assets. Analysts call the court's decision an important step in the building of a multi-party system, which the country has not had for more than 30 years. In a televised statement last week, Mubarak <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13029597">denied the corruption charges</a> [BBC report] against him, asserted his right to defend his reputation and expressed his <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/04/10/144957.html">willingness to cooperate</a> [Al Arabiya report] with investigations, denying that he owns property abroad or holds foreign bank accounts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amended bill proposes to revoke tax credits from businesses that hire illegal immigrants and would also require the use of the E-verify System to check the eligibility status of employees. The Indiana Senate <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] in February by a 31-18 vote, but also included a controversial provision which would allow police officers to inquire into one's immigration status during a lawful stop, seizure, detention, or arrest. This provision was excluded from the amended bill approved by the House. Supporters of the legislation maintain it is <a href="http://www.ibj.com/indiana-house-oks-watereddown-immigration-bill/PARAMS/article/26741">necessary to act on immigration issues</a> [AP report] because of Congress' failure to address the problem, while opponents contend that the bill could harm businesses within the state. The House and Senate are expected to begin work next week on a compromise version of the two bills. Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/">Governor Mitch Daniels</a> (R) [official website] has indicated that he supports the House version of the legislation.  

<p><a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] have all approved Arizona-style immigration bills within the past year. Nonetheless, these type of laws remain controversial. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/04/11/10-16645_opinion.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] a lower court decision to enjoin several provisions of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">controversial immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials]. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in July to permanently enjoin Arizona from enforcing the law, arguing that it is preempted by federal law and is thus a violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. In response, Arizona <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/arizona-governor-countersues-us-government-over-immigration-law.php">countersued</a> [JURIST report] the federal government alleging an infringement upon state rights. In May, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] also seeking an injunction against Arizona's immigration law.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table> [JURIST] The <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/FCC-v.-Fox-TV-petition-4-21-11.pdf">asked</a> [cert. petition, PDF] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] to reinstate an <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/cgb/consumerfacts/obscene.html">indecency policy</a> [text] that places restrictions on profanity and nudity during television broadcasting. In July, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-fcc-indecency-policy-unconstitutional.php">policy was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The court held that the policy was a violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] right to freedom of speech because it was unconstitutionally vague and could have a "chilling effect" on speech. In its petition, the government expressed concern for the consequences of allowing broadcasting to continue without the restrictions of the policy:<blockquote>The Court of Appeals' decisions preclude the Commission from effectively implementing statutory restrictions on broadcast indecency that the agency has enforced since its creation in 1934. Accordingly, broadcasters may well believe that they have been freed of the public-interest obligation not to air indecent programming that they assumed when they were originally "granted the free and exclusive use of a limited and valuable part of the public domain."</blockquote>The court of appeals did not reject the idea of creating a new policy that is constitutional, but the government argues that, until the FCC can find a solution to overcome vagueness, it lacks the power to fulfill its statutory obligation to limit indecency in broadcasting. 

<p>This case hinges on indecency issues raised in two separate broadcasts, one in which a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-04/abc-1-2-million-fine-for-nudity-on-nypd-blue-canceled-by-appeals-court.html">nudity scene appeared in a television crime show</a> [Bloomberg report] during prime-time hours, and the other involving <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703959704575453492807569162.html">celebrities using expletives</a> [WSJ report] during live broadcasting events. The Supreme Court originally remanded the case to the Second Circuit after <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-582.ZC.html">ruling</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-upholds-fcc-ban-on.php">report</a>] in April 2009 that the FCC did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in changing its policy regarding fines for the broadcast of isolated expletives. That ruling overturned a previous <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/federal-appeals-court-overturns-fcc.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Second Circuit, which held that the 2004 policy was arbitrary and capricious under the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [text] for failing to articulate a reasoned basis for its change in policy. The Supreme Court declined to address the constitutionality of the FCC policy in its decision and remanded the case to the lower court for further consideration of the constitutional issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo's office stated:<blockquote>The Office of the Prosecutor is closely following on the situation in Nigeria and is concerned with the outbreak of violence surrounding the National Assembly and Presidential elections of April 2011.  In the context of its on-going preliminary examination activities, the Office will seek to establish whether the recent violence may have been planned and organized and whether crimes falling within the Court's jurisdiction may have been committed.  The Office is mindful that the upcoming governorship elections on 26 April could lead to further violence. . . . The Office of the Prosecutor welcomes Nigeria's political leaders' call on their supporters to show restraint and avoid unrest.</blockquote>Moreno-Ocampo indicated his office will support domestic investigations into the post-election violence as well.

<p>Previous elections in Nigeria have been marred by <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-state-elections-marred-by.php">violence</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/nigeria-opposition-groups-allege-fraud.php">fraud</a> [JURIST reports].

UAE social affairs minister, Mariam Mohammed Khalfan Al-Roumi, dismissed the elected board members of the Jurist Association civil rights group and appointed state officials in their stead. The decree dismissing the board members alleged that the Jurist Association violated UAE's recently enacted laws that prohibit nongovernmental organizations and its members from interfering "in politics or in matters that impair State security and its ruling regime." Al-Roumi issued the decree in response to a petition filed by the Jurist Association, other nongovernmental organizations, and hundreds of UAE citizens <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/22/us-emirates-hrw-idUSTRE73L45T20110422">seeking political reform</a> [Reuters report].

HRW has continued to monitor the UAE's compliance with international human rights standards following a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/united-arab-emirates">2010 report</a> [HRW report] suggesting the human rights climate in the UAE has worsened.

<p>In addition to armed clashes with Thailand, Cambodia's border with Vietnam has also been a subject of controversy. Last month, Cambodian opposition leader <a href="http://www.samrainsyparty.org/about/about_sam_rainsy.htm">Sam Rainsy</a> [party profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rainsy">news archive</a>] lost his final appeal to the Cambodian Supreme Court on charges of <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/cambodia-court-rejects-opposition-leaders-final-appeal.php">intentionally destroying posts</a> [JURIST report] marking the border between Cambodia and Vietnam and inciting racial discrimination through that act. The ruling upheld Rainsy's September 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cambodia-opposition-leader-convicted-over-vietnam-border-controversy.php">conviction </a> [JURIST report], given <em>in absentia</em> due to his self-imposed exile since 2005. <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] strongly <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-group-criticizes-cambodia.php">criticized the ruling</a> [JURIST report], saying that it showed the government's control over the country's judiciary.</p>

Saleh agreed to a proposal requiring him to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110423/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_yemen;_ylt=A0wNdNomM7NNzX8AZTl34T0D">hand power over to his deputy in 30 days</a> [AP report] in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Opposition groups have accepted the resignation with <a href="http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&SubID=3483">some reservations</a> [<em>Yemen Post</em> report] &#8212; including disagreement with the proposition to form a national unity government in the next week, rather than once Saleh has formally vacated his office. Demonstrators concerned that the resignation was a political ploy <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/04/201142494657612665.html">continued to protest</a> [Al Jazeera report] throughout Yemen. The <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> [official website], a group of six nations from the region, helped to broker the agreement.

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] urging the international community to pressure Yemeni authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">investigate the deaths of protesters</a> [JURIST report]. The report chronicles reports of beatings and use of excessive force by security forces including shootings of peaceful protesters. AI criticizes the response of authorities to the mounting death tolls as woefully inadequate. The <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] earlier this month released the <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">report</a>] that, among other things, pointed out the ongoing extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, police and military abuses and restrictions on freedom of expression in Yemen. In March, the Yemeni parliament passed <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">temporary emergency laws</a> [JURIST report], giving the government more power to arrest and detain protesters and to censor the media.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The class action <a href="http://securities.stanford.edu/1044/CFC10_01/2010114_f01c_1000302.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed by a number of investors who claim to have been financially harmed by Countrywide's misleading customer practices. Judge Mariana Pfaelzer dismissed BOA from the suit after the plaintiffs failed to prove a <em>de facto</em> merger, finding instead that two separate asset acquisition transactions in 2008 did not result in the effective merger of the businesses, thereby protecting BOA from successor liability. The plaintiffs still have claims pending against Countrywide and several other banks that served as underwriters of the securities, including <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.db.com/index_e.htm">Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.</a> [corporate websites]. The remaining defendants have also <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-22/bank-of-america-wins-dismissal-of-countrywide-securities-claims.html">filed motions to dismiss</a> [Bloomberg report], but those rulings have yet to be issued.

<p>BOA has recently been the target of several lawsuits. In February, BOA reached a $410 million settlement in a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/bank-of-america-settles-excessive-overdraft-fee-lawsuit.php">class action suit</a> [JURIST report] accusing the bank of excessive overdraft fees. In January, plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/investors-sue-bank-of-america-subsidiary-for-fraud.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Countrywide in <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/supctmanh/">New York State Supreme Court</a> [official website] alleging widespread fraud that resulted in substantial financial losses. Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard filed a lawsuit in mid-December against BOA for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/arizona-ag-sues-bank-of-america-for-mortgage-fraud.php">misleading customers</a> [JURIST report] in mortgage modification and foreclosure practices. Earlier in the month, the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] reached a $137 million <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/bank-of-america-reaches-137-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] with BOA over <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2010/34-63451.pdf">fraud charges</a> [order, PDF] in a lawsuit that claimed BOA used anti-competitive bidding processes with 20 state municipalities.

HRW also called on the US and UN to issue sanctions against Syrian government officials who are responsible for the excessive use of lethal force and other rights violations against protesters. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, US President Barack Obama, and the leaders of several European nations <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gMC3zRPLFVrGrDSIV2m0ccwbVaTw?docId=CNG.1162cc65f46ade8c93d4c3d8b3d59307.441">issued strong condemnations</a> [AFP report] of the April 22 shootings, which resulted in the deaths of at least 80 protesters. HRW Deputy Middle East Director Joe Stork said condemnations from the international community are "not enough" to stop the violence, saying "faced with the Syrian authorities' 'shoot to kill' strategy, the international community needs to impose sanctions on those ordering the shooting of protesters."

<p>This is not the first time Syria has come under fire for its violent use of force against anti-government protesters, which so far have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">led to 170 deaths</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have stopped medical personnel, sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Last month, Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-president-forms-committee-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">ordered the formation of a committee</a> [JURIST report] that will discuss repealing the country's 48-year-old state of emergency law that bans protests and allows police to detain civilians without charges. Al-Assad announced earlier in March that the government would consider <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/syria-government-to-consider-ending-emergency-law.php">ending the state of emergency</a> [JURIST report].

According to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/19/hungary-new-constitution-enshrines-discrimination">statement</a> [text] released by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], the new constitution "enshrines discrimination," and jeopardizes the rights of people with disabilities, women and LGBT people. The Council of Europe's <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/">Venice Commission</a> [official website] also released an <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/docs/2011/CDL-AD(2011)001-e.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] criticizing the manner in which Hungary went about getting the constitution approved. Although the commission was asked to comment on the constitution prior to its approval, it was unable to do so because it did not get the document in time. The constitution introduces several changes, including a debt ceiling where the country's debt cannot exceed 50 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP); a reform of the Fiscal Council, giving the group the right to veto the budget and dissolve parliament for failure to pass an annual budget by the end of March; a definition of marriage as a union between man and woman; and a statement that the life of a fetus begins at and should be protected from conception. The constitution also includes a <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php?Cikk=161565">new preamble</a> [text, in Hungarian], that condemns the communist and socialist climate in Hungary that existed from 1944 to 1990 and solidifies democratization that began 20 years ago.

<p>The <a href="http://www.mkogy.hu/">National Assembly of Hungary</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php?Cikk=161564">approved</a> [statement, in Hungarian] the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">new constitution</a> last week by a margin of 262-44 and one abstention, and European lawmakers have already <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/eu-lawmakers-request-review-of-hungary-constitution.php">sought EU review</a> [JURIST reports] of the document. Members of the country's <a href="http://mszp.hu/">socialist party</a> (MSZP) [official website, in Hungarian] and <a href="http://lehetmas.hu/">green liberal political party</a> (LMP) <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/18/hungary-constitution-idUSLDE73H0TT20110418">boycotted the vote</a> [Reuters report]. The measure was supported by and passed as a result of the ruling <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Hungarian Civic Party</a> (FIDESZ) [official website, in Hungarian], which has controlled a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly since 2010. Other laws passed by the FIDESZ-led parliament have garnered controversy as well. In February, the government agreed to change its <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hungary-agrees-to-change-controversial-media-law.php">controversial media law</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hungary-will-respond-to-eu-objections-over-strict-media-law.php">negotiations between Hungarian and EU representatives</a> [JURIST reports]. The law created the <a href="http://www.nhh.hu/index.php?lang=hu">National Media Communications Authority</a> (NMHH) [official website, in Hungarian], which controls private television and radio broadcasters, newspapers and online news sites. Under the law, the government could fine broadcasters more than 700,000 euros and newspapers and news websites roughly 90,000 euros if their coverage is deemed unbalanced or immoral by the NMHH, made up of members loyal to FIDESZ. The law was approved in December 2010 and went into effect in January amid protests from members of the media, other European governments as well as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website], which <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urges-hungary-to-amend-new-media-law.php">urged Hungary to amend the law</a> [JURIST report] because it curtails freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protesters, led by the Facebook youth movement Fevrier 20 <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/24/morocco.protests/">rejected</a> [CNN report] the king's draft of the new constitution because it was written by his own people. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Moroccan cities of Casablanca, Tangiers, Marrakesh and the capital of Rabat. Mohammed has made some concessions since the outbreak of protests last February including the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iBuLLF5X6VugoXHm-ulctDsvCoGQ?docId=CNG.81e3f073a7ff60182e936e010de882cd.621">release of political prisoners</a> [AFP report] and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/morocco-king-announces-plans-for-constitutional-reform.php">development of a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] with greater civil liberties and an independent judiciary. Still, the protesteors Sunday criticized the king's decision to appoint a council to write the new constitution. They also demanded an end to corruption, which they claim has deterred vital foreign investment in the country. 

<p>Mohammed said that the new constitution would result in more power being given to elected officials, as well as an independent judiciary. Under the plan, the prime minister would be chosen based on the political party elected to a majority of seats in parliament and more power would be granted to the parliament. Also, local officials would be granted more power through a "regionalization program" where officials would be elected to regional councils through a direct vote. The councils would be responsible for governing the affairs of the region. The announcement of the constitutional reforms came less than a month after <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h0nK8l_SJCtJBKcT7YkOImpIhsPw?docId=CNG.9bfa3f79ce20b70cbc21d53796182754.101">thousands of Moroccans demonstrated</a> [AFP report] across the country, demanding limits on the power of the monarch, as well as more sweeping political reform. Similar protests have occurred recently throughout the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder], and have resulted in the resignations of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">Tunisian president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST reports], and an ongoing conflict between protesters and Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement follows major condemnations of the Syrian government's excessive use of lethal force and other rights violations against protesters. Syrian security forces have been responsible for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/syria-good-friday-protests-begin-expected-to-be-largest-protests-yet/2011/04/22/AFfJBQOE_blog.html">fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters</a> [WP report] within the last week, including the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gMC3zRPLFVrGrDSIV2m0ccwbVaTw?docId=CNG.1162cc65f46ade8c93d4c3d8b3d59307.441">April 22 shootings</a> [AFP report] which resulted in more than 75 deaths. In addition to the halt, Pillay has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38181&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">called for a full investigation</a> [UN News Centre report] into the recent deaths with hopes to serve justice against those ordering the shootings. The investigation is supported by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sgsm13521.doc.htm">publicly reminded</a> [press release] Syrian authorities of their obligation "to respect international human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as well as the freedom of the press." UN officials hope that these immediate measures will ensure social peace and order and facilitate the development of government reforms in Syria. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] has also called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-requests-international-inquiry-into-killings-of-syria-protestors.php">international investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the killings.

<p>Last week, Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued. Earlier this month, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">stopped medical personnel</a> [JURIST report], sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Last month, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence.

The writ was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in February by the state's attorney general, <a href="http://www.vaag.com/index.html">Kenneth Cuccinelli</a> [official website], who sought to have the high court depart from its traditional procedure and instead review the constitutionality of the law before the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] rules on the issue. In the absence of war or a constitutional crisis, the Supreme Court will rarely intervene to decide a legal issue before it has been addressed by the appropriate appellate courts. Judicial review of the health care reform law will now <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g4Awx7bbAMJfAcqo3ksassdk-44A?docId=e99e10a441a942a4a352102450c0479a">continue in federal appeals court</a> [AP report]. The appeal stems from a December ruling by a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] that the minimum coverage provision of the health care reform law is <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. This ruling has been put on hold, pending appeal.

<p>The enactment of the health care reform law has incited a number of legal challenges in addition to that posed by Virginia. Last week a judge for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-healthcare-reform-act.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. Judge Freda Wolfson dismissed the lawsuit, brought without an attorney by two New Jersey residents, on jurisdictional grounds, ruling the two men had no <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing">standing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to challenge the law. In a similar ruling earlier in the month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.nhd.uscourts.gov/default.asp">US District Court for the District of New Hampshire</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] also challenging the law's constitutionality and held that the plaintiff, 80-year-old Harold Peterson, lacked standing because his Medicare coverage automatically satisfied the law's insurance mandate. A judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] has also <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down the law</a>, while judges in <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">Michigan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Virginia have upheld it</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another recent referendum has created some instability in Sudan. In January, more than 98 percent of southern Sudanese voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/sudan-referendum-voters-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-secession.php">voted in favor of secession</a> [JURIST report] from northern Sudan. Sudanese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sudan-president-accepts-southern-sudans-vote-for-independance.php">issued a formal decree</a> [JURIST report] in February accepting the result of the referendum as the will of the southern people. The secession will officially take place on July 9 in Juba, the capital of Southern Sudan. There have been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1380413/South-Sudan-violence-leaves-165-dead-threatens-destabilise-embyronic-state.html">101 deaths in the region since Tuesday</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] as a result of fighting between the south Sudanese army and rebel militias. The southern Sudanese government has accused the north of facilitating the fighting in order to create instability in the region to maintain the region's reliance on the north's oil infrastructure. In September, a human rights expert told the UN that Sudan was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rights-expert-tells-un-sudan-unprepared-for-january-self-determination-referendum.php">not prepared</a> [JURIST report] for the referendum and that a lack of infrastructure in southern Sudan could lead to human rights violations, including suppression of free speech and inadequate protection of society due to a lack of well-trained police officers, prosecutors and judges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Halliburton</a> [oral argument transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-seven-cases.php">report</a>]. The court will determine whether investor losses need to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence at the class certification stage prior to full discovery in order for the class action lawsuit to proceed. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/08/08-11195-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that this was procedurally proper. The Fifth Circuit also determined that a plaintiff must establish loss causation to invoke the fraud-on-the-market presumption laid out in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5589356734421689123&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Basic v. Levinson</a> [opinion]. Counsel for the petitioner argued that when a court holds at the class certification stage that there is no efficient market, and the issue of efficient market goes to the presumption of reliance, the basis for assuming class-wide reliance is impacted. Further that the <span class="casename">Basic</span> reliance presumption can be rebutted at the certification stage. Counsel also explained that loss causation is tested at the pleadings, summary judgment, and trial stages&#8212;and "the question is whether a fourth test should be interposed at the class certification stage." Counsel argued that loss causation is a class-wide issue and an element of the merits case, and must be proven at all three stages, but "because it is something that is common for all of the class members, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Rule 23</a> [text] says that is something for trial, not for class certification." Amicus curiae for the government argued that: <blockquote>The Fifth Circuit erred in requiring proof of loss causation at class certification for three reasons: First, it's conducting a merits inquiry that's not tethered to the Rule 23 requirements; second, it's not taking a presumption and requiring plaintiffs to prove it; and third, it's confusing the distinct elements of reliance and loss causation. ... [The Fifth Circuit] is not talking about rebutting the presumption of reliance, giving the defendants an opportunity to do that at class certification. It is putting an affirmative burden on plaintiffs that they have to meet in every single case, even if the defendants do not come to court with any evidence. And that is a very heavy burden, as the district court in this case realized ... the question is do common issues predominate over individual ones. What you're trying to answer is can this group of people proceed together, not can this group of people make out their case.</blockquote>Counsel for the respondent argued that according to Basic, "absent the class-wide presumption of fraud on the market reliance, individual issues of reliance predominate." Thus, when a district court finds "that the presumption is unavailable or rebutted, reliance ceases to be a class-wide issue." Further, that <span class="casename">Basic</span> sets forth a special rule and is an exception to the rule of nonsusceptibility in class actions to class treatment of fraud cases. According to <span class="casename">Basic</span>, it is not just enough to allege operative facts, but you have to plead and prove them and they are subject to common proof. "[U]nless those facts are proven at the class certification stage, the presumption of class-wide reliance doesn't apply and individual issues of reliance predominate."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-5258.pdf">McNeill v. United States</a> [oral argument transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-seven-cases.php">report</a>], the court will determine how retroactive sentencing laws affect the definition of a "serious drug offense" under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000924----000-.html">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [18 USC &#167; 924]. Clifton McNeill was arrested in 2007 after police discovered a firearm and 3.1 grams of cocaine during a search incident to arrest for eluding a traffic stop. In light of previous drug convictions in 1992 and 1995, McNeill was convicted under the ACCA. The previous convictions and sentencing structure met the definitions of a "serious drug offense" at the time they were committed, but the statutory sentences for those offenses were reduced in later years and do not currently meet the ACCA definition. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/McNeill-v.-US-4th-Cir.-Opinion.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the ACCA still applied regardless of the subsequent statutory changes. Counsel for the petitioner argued:<blockquote>When Congress defined in the Armed Career Criminal Act a "serious" drug offense as one for which a State penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed by law, it meant for Federal courts to look to the law presently in effect in that State. This is the most natural reading of the statute, and words matter. It is also consistent with ACCA's purpose, which is [to] punish the Federal firearms offense ... [but] not to enhance a sentence because of the prior conviction. ... [W]hen the defendant commits the offense, what his status is at that time under the law we think makes sense and is consonant with the purpose of what ACCA is trying to do. ACCA is not trying to punish the State offense at the time. ... The question is, in a statute that defers to the judgment of the States to determine seriousness, are we going to defer to the current State assessment of what seriousness is or are we going to look back to repeal the discarded judgments?</blockquote>Counsel for the government argued that when sentencing, the court should "consider the offense and the punishment as they were defined by the body of law under which the defendant was convicted and sentenced." Further that the government's reading does not require the court to recharacterize the old offense at all. "[R]equiring the court to look to the time of the underlying conviction and sentencing unifies the inquiry across both components of the definition of serious drug offense and the definition of violent felony. ... And if the State actually thinks that the previous offenses that were committed were less serious, then it could make the decreased maximum term of imprisonment retroactively applicable if it wanted to demonstrate that it really thought that those were mistakes."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The VDOC grooming policy prohibits inmates from growing long hair and beards except for medical reasons. The Muslim inmate claimed that the prohibition on beards violates his religious rights under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html">42 USC &#167; 1983</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00002000--cc001-.html">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> (RLUIPA) [42 USC &#167; 2000cc-1 text]. VDOC argued the restriction was necessary to prevent inmates from altering their appearance or identifying with a gang. The inmate responded that there were no security concerns implicated in the growing of beards, and VDOC had not adopted the least restrictive means. The court ruled Thursday that:<blockquote>It is not this court's duty under RLUIPA to select on its own the least restrictive alternative but rather to defer, within reason, to the judgments of prison administrators. Consequently, in analyzing whether a particular regulation is the least restrictive means of furthering the government's compelling security interest, the reviewing court must avoid "substituting its judgment in place of the experience and expertise of prison officials."</blockquote> Defense counsel for the inmate <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jLEdbK5pbJDTKHpI-L2pM49yOMzA?docId=423f6868638945808eb617b1cb9e44f7">filed an appeal</a> [AP report] on Monday to the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website].

The documents&#8212;detailing things such as the circumstances of detention, the evidence justifying detention, detainee risk evaluations, and the decision process of which detainees to transfer, hold, or release of 758 of the 779 total detainees&#8212;were published in part on the WikiLeaks website and released to media outlets. According to the media outlets that have analyzed the documents, they reveal that 220 high value <a href="http://www.cfr.org/terrorist-organizations/al-qaeda-k-al-qaida-al-qaida/p9126">al Qaeda</a> [CFR backgrounder] operatives had been held at Guantanamo, in addition to 150 who had been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/25/guantanamo-files-lift-lid-prison">held for years without significant evidence against them</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. The documents also detailed the practice of US forces detaining people in Afghanistan based on their <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8471907/WikiLeaks-Guantanamo-Bay-terrorist-secrets-revealed.html">wearing a particular model of watch</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] that is known to be used by al Qaeda leaders. Additionally, 20 juveniles were held at the detention facility, including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=khadr">Omar Khadr</a> [JURIST news archive], who was classified as a high value detainee by the Obama administration and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/khadr-pleads-guilty-to-terrorism-charges.php">agreed to a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] after eight years in detention. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] stated that the leaks emphasized the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/guantanamo-documents-underscore-need-independent-judicial-review-says-aclu">necessity of judicial review</a> [press release]:<blockquote>These documents are remarkable because they show just how questionable the government's basis has been for detaining hundreds of people, in some cases indefinitely, at Guantanamo. The one-sided assessments are rife with uncorroborated evidence, information obtained through torture, speculation, errors and allegations that have been proven false. If the government had followed the law, it would have established a meaningful and prompt process to separate the innocent from those who are legally detainable.</blockquote>In responding to the documents, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Defense Department</a> (DOD) [official website] emphasized that some documents that have not been leaked, including the Guantanamo Review Task Force, which may <a href="http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14439">reflect a change in the government classifications</a> [press release] of detainees. The DOD also stated that the administration had "made the protection of American citizens the top priority and we are concerned that the disclosure of these documents could be damaging to those efforts."

<p>The military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba was <a href="/thisday/2011/01/first-detainees-arrived-at-guantanamo-bay.php">opened in January 2002</a> [JURIST Archives report], and has consistently been a focal point for national and international controversy over the treatment of detainees. The leaks come as President Barack Obama has been <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">attempting to close the facility</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+AND+transfer">transfer the detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] to other countries. Closing the facility has <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/us-defense-secretary-says-guantanamo-closing-unlikely.php">faced several difficulties</a>, however, and attempts to prosecute detainees in civilian courts have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">recently failed</a> [JURIST reports]. The Guantanamo Files are the latest in a line of leaks that have shed light on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/wikileaks-founder-alleges-documents-may-reveal-us-war-crimes-in-afghanistan.php">military</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/leaked-cables-reveal-us-urged-germany-not-to-prosecute-cia-officials-for-rendition.php">diplomatic actions</a> [JURIST reports] of the US government in the aftermath of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=9%2F11">9/11 terror attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder said that the DOJ's priorities will include protecting Americans from terrorism at home and abroad, fighting violent crime, combating financial fraud and protecting the most vulnerable members of society. Holder recognized the DOJ's work in fighting terrorism, citing that the department prosecuted more terrorists than in any other two-year period. The DOJ also filed a record number of civil rights and criminal cases and secured an all time high in civil recoveries. Holder touted the DOJ's record recoveries from financial fraud and efforts to increase awareness about financial crimes. He also emphasized that the department will seek to use the federal court system to try terrorism cases. 

<p>The speech comes on the heels of Holder's failed attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">try the 9/11 conspirators in civil trials</a> [JURIST report] in New York. Holder announced earlier this month that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report]. Holder referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US. Holder refused to delay the trial any longer for the sake of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families, explaining that the restrictions are not likely to be repealed in the immediate future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The motion said that District Judge Vaughn Walker, who has since retired from the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], was potentially biased in his ruling last year which <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">found the marriage ban unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] because he has been in a long-term same-sex relationship. Attorneys for <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com">Protect Marriage</a> [advocacy website], the organization sponsoring the ban, argued that Walker was in the same position as the same-sex couples who brought the case and that he had ruled in his own interest. The motion also alleged that Walker failed to properly admit  his stake in the case:<blockquote>Chief Judge Walker thus had a duty to disclose not only the facts concerning his relationship, but also his marriage intentions. ... Only if Chief Judge Walker had unequivocally disavowed any interest in marrying his partner could the parties and the public be confident that he did not have a direct personal interest in the outcome of the case. ... Because he did not do so when the case was assigned to him, and has not done so since, it must be presumed that he has an interest in marrying his partner and therefore was in fact the "judge in his own case."</blockquote> Walker <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-gaymarriage-judge-idUSTRE7356TA20110406">admitted his relationship to the press</a> [Reuters report] earlier this month and defended his decision, saying that race, gender and sexual orientation should not affect a judge's ability to rule on a case.

<p>Last month, the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ninth-circuit-refuses-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] filed by California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-ag-asks-ninth-circuit-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-stay.php">lift the stay order</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting gay couples from marrying while an appeal of the invalidation of Proposition 8 is pending. A week earlier, supporters of the marriage ban urged the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/proposition-8-supporters-argue-for-standing-to-appeal.php">allow them to defend the measure</a> [JURIST report] when state officials refuse to do so. When Walker struck down Proposition 8 last year, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current Governor <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Jerry Brown</a> [official website], who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report], leaving defendant-intervenors Project Marriage and other groups to defend the law. In February, the Supreme Court of California announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/california-supreme-court-agrees-to-rule-on-prop-8-standing-issue.php">decide the critical procedural issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine if the pending federal appeal of the invalidation of Proposition 8 can continue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tohono O'odham Indian Nation</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-summary-judgment-appeal.php">report</a>] that the tribe cannot bring a suit based on the same facts in both federal district court and the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Federal Claims</a> (CFC) [official website]. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1500.html">28 USC &#167; 1500</a> [text] provides that the CFC lacks jurisdiction over "any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff has any suit or process against the United States" or its agents "pending in any other court." The Tohono O'odham Nation filed a complaint against the US in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, and, one day later, it filed a similar complaint against the US in the CFC. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-5043.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] the CFC's dismissal of the case, concluding "that the Nation's complaint in the Court of Federal Claims seeks relief that is different from the relief sought in its earlier-filed district court action." Reversing the decision below, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote:<blockquote>The two actions both allege that the United States holds the same assets in trust for the Nation's benefit. They describe almost identical breaches of fiduciary duty. ... Indeed, it appears that the Nation could have filed two identical complaints, save the caption and prayer for relief, without changing either suit in any significant respect.

<p>Under &#167;1500, the substantial overlap in operative facts between the Nation's District Court and CFC suits precludes jurisdiction in the CFC. The Court of Appeals erred when it concluded otherwise.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision.</p>

<p>The tribe filed suit in federal district court alleging that the US government had breached its fiduciary duty by mismanaging funds held in trust for the tribe. The suit sought an accounting and other equitable relief. The tribe then filed suit in the CFC seeking monetary relief. The CFC dismissed the suit, finding that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-sg-appoints-panel-to-investigate-sri-lanka-civil-war-rights-abuses.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] the three-person panel last year to investigate possible human rights violations during the war. Ban said that he decided to release the report to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5222">promote transparency and accountability</a> [statement] while examining the allegations, despite warnings from the Sri Lankan government that publishing the report <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/21/sri-lanka-un-war-crimes-report">could lead to renewed violence</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the country. The panel investigators allegedly found evidence showing:<blockquote>that a wide range of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law was committed both by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE, some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. Indeed, the conduct of the war represented a grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to protect individual dignity during both war and peace.</blockquote>Rights organizations like <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] responded to the report, calling for the UN to immediately <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/25/sri-lanka-un-chief-should-establish-international-inquiry">launch an independent war crimes investigation</a> [news release] in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan government, which maintains that the conflict did not involve any civilian deaths, has complained that the report is <a href="http://www.mea.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2730&Itemid=75">"fundamentally flawed"</a> [statement].

<p>The Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.slmfa.gov.lk/">Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced in December that a UN war crimes panel would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to look into alleged war crimes in the final stages of the 26-year civil war. The decision represented a reversal after months of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government under <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/index.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who described the UN panel as an infringement of Sri Lanka's sovereignty. Instead, Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to investigate the final years of the conflict from the ceasefire in 2002 to its conclusion in 2009. The LLRC's credibility, however, has been contested by several human rights organizations, which say the <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lanka-allows-un-panel-to-visit-colombo/137842-2.html">commission lacks objectivity</a> [PTI report]. The change in position also followed economic sanctions, including the withdrawal of trade concessions worth $150 million per year with the EU. The government has repeatedly denied accusations that its forces violated international law during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-judge panel concluded that the jury that sentenced Abu-Jamal to death was given an improper jury instruction regarding the use of mitigating factors. According to the court, the instructions could have indicated to the jury that there must be unanimous agreement among the jury in order for mitigating factors to be considered, and that the jury could have concluded that they must unanimously agree that the mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating factors in order to sentence Abu-Jamal to life in prison. The court concluded that both the verdict form and jury instruction indicated that unanimity was required when considering mitigating circumstances, which is inconsistent with state law. Under Pennsylvania state law, mitigating circumstances are to be considered regardless of agreement among the jury, and the law only requires one juror to find that mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating factors to result in a life sentence. The court noted that the Pennsylvania sentencing form has been changed since Abu-Jamal's sentencing, that it now "reflects the requirement that jurors not be prevented from considering all evidence in mitigation," and that it "makes explicit that unanimity is not required in determining the existence of mitigating circumstances." According to the court, the clarifications "highlight the ambiguity at issue in this case and on their own serve at least to suggest the substantial probability that some jurors were prevented from considering factors which may call for a less severe penalty" The court ordered Pennsylvania to conduct a new sentencing hearing within 180 days, or the sentence of life in prison would stand. The district attorney representing the state in the case indicated that he would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jmujyktf0thHYzlPtCp70rXgmkzw?docId=28296761d1ef48f99e7be880ec2b718c">consider an appeal</a> [AP report] to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>]. 

<p>The Supreme Court has considered Abu-Jamal's case in several previous rulings. The court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-remands-mumia-case-to.php">remanded the case to the Third Circuit</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010 for further consideration in light of the ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-724.pdf">Smith v. Spisak</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-reverses-sixth-circuit-in.php">report</a>]. In 2008, the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-appeals-court-backs-new.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a district court ruling overturning the sentence in Abu-Jamal's case, and the only issue to be determined on remand was whether the court erred in allowing the new sentencing hearing. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-declines-to-review-mumia.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] Abu-Jamal's conviction in April 2009. Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing police officer <a href="http://www.danielfaulkner.com/">Daniel Faulkner</a> [advocacy website] after Faulkner pulled over Abu-Jamal's brother for a traffic violation. The case has become a focal point for death penalty opponents, attracting the attention of artists, civil rights activists and politicians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

IMS Health</a> [oral argument transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-grants-certiorari-in-seven-cases.php">report</a>] to determine whether a state law prohibiting prescription drug manufacturers from using data collected from physicians is a violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a> [text] right to freedom of speech. The law in question targets pharmaceutical companies and has the effect of limiting the scope of marketing prescription drugs within the state. Counsel for the petitioner, the state of Vermont, argued that the aim of the law was to protect physician privacy, and that pharmaceutical companies have no right to the data in question. The petitioner also argued that the law does not regulate the content of the advertising, but rather the access the companies have to specific data. Counsel for the respondents argued that the court should avoid an "absolute" rule regarding collection of data, but should rather allow states to address privacy issues through laws with a more narrow scope than the Vermont law. The US argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of the petitioners in the case.

<p>The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9ca25622-5b69-45b1-a410-a1ce46eaea5c/1/doc/09-1913_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9ca25622-5b69-45b1-a410-a1ce46eaea5c/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in August 2009 that the district court erred in their finding that the Vermont statute was constitutionally permissible. The court of appeals held that the statute was an impermissible restriction on corporate speech that does not withstand immediate scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored to advance a substantial state interest. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Mohammad Saaili Shibin is believed to have been the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110427/ap_on_re_us/us_prosecuting_pirates">chief negotiator for the pirates</a> [AP report] accused of the highjacking. Shibin, unlike the other pirates suspected in the hijacking, never boarded the yacht and acted as chief negotiator for the pirates who took control of the American-manned yacht in the Arabian Sea. Shibin, whom the US believes to be the highest-ranking pirate it has ever captured, is the first suspected pirate to be taken into custody in Somalia rather than at sea. Though Shibin denies guilt in this case, he acknowledged being paid $30,000 for his participation in negotiating the return of a German vessel that was taken hostage by pirates in May. The US government is currently negotiating with the German government, and additional charges are likely to be brought against Shidin in that case.

<p>In April, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">Somali pirate was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/Press_Releases/2011%20Archives/April/11-135.pdf">25 years in prison</a> [press release, PDF] for attacking a Danish ship off the coast of Somalia in 2008, for which he and other pirates received a $1.7 million ransom. In March, a grand jury in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="http://media2.wavy.com/html/PDFs/Salad%20et%20al_indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [text, PDF] 14 suspects for overtaking Quest, a yacht operated by four Americans. The Americans, who were taken as hostages and  later killed by the pirates, were the first US citizens to die in the recent wave of international <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pirates">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive]. The suspects, 13 Somali and one Yemeni, were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-court-indicts-14-suspected-pirates.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with piracy, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and the use of firearms during a crime. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report's authors, including a retired US Army general, reviewed the medical records and case files of nine detainees, each of whom claim to have been subjected to treatment prohibited under the UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text]. Comparing the detainees' medical histories to their accusations of abuse, the study found that:<blockquote>The medical affidavits in each of the nine cases indicate that the specific allegations of torture and ill treatment are highly consistent with physical and psychological evidence documented in the medical records and evaluations by non-governmental medical experts. However, the medical personnel who treated the detainees at [Guantanamo Bay] failed to inquire and/or document causes of the physical injuries and psychological symptoms they observed.</blockquote>The study also argues that it is a breach of <a href="http://www.wma.net/en/10home/index.html">World Medical Association</a> (WMA) [official website] <a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html">ethical guidelines</a> [text] for any medical professional to assist in concealing evidence of abuse.

<p>The military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba was <a href="/thisday/2011/01/first-detainees-arrived-at-guantanamo-bay.php">opened in January 2002</a> [JURIST Archives report], and has consistently been a focal point for national and international controversy over the treatment of detainees. Earlier this week, <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/">WikiLeaks</a> [official website] began publishing <a href="http://wikileaks.ch/gitmo/">The Guantanamo Files</a> [materials], a collection of more than 700 classified documents relating to the evidence and treatment of almost all detainees held at the facility between 2002 and 2008. A letter from a Guantanamo Bay detainee, made public in 2009, noted his deteriorating medical state and alleged that <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/guantanamo-detainee-conditions-have.php">conditions at the prison worsened</a> [JURIST report] for detainees in the year following President Barack Obama's election.  In 2007, more than 260 doctors from 16 countries <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/doctors-attack-unethical-medical.php">signed a letter</a> critical of US military physicians for participating in the <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/gitmo-hunger-strike-gains-momentum.php">force-feeding of at least 128 detainees</a> [JURIST reports] on hunger strikes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/10/27/08-56394.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the FAA does not preempt a California unconscionability law, which allowed a class action against AT&#38;T mobile despite a contractual clause prohibiting such proceedings. Reversing the Ninth Circuit, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority that, "[s]tates cannot require a procedure that is inconsistent with the FAA, even if it is desirable for unrelated reasons." Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissent.

<p>In 2002, Vincent and Liza Concepcion purchased a discounted cellular telephone from AT&#38;T and later accused the company of false advertising and fraud upon discovery that they had been charged sales tax on the device's full value. Despite an arbitration clause in their service contract, the couple brought a federal class action suit against the company.  Counsel for the Concepcions urged the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court rulings, arguing, in part, that the California law is valid because it "[ensures] that arbitration is a matter of consent and not coercion, and that it represents merely a choice of forum, but not an exemption from the law."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The combined cases against Tymoshenko include charges initiated in December for allegedly misappropriating state funds during her time as prime minister from 2007-2010 and new charges in January alleging that she <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ukraine-prosecutors-launch-new-investigation-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">abused her authority and exceeded her official duties</a> [JURIST reports].

Appeals chamber judges said that last week's decision was based on Erlinder's <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/index.php?issue=14608&article=40594">failure to appear at the tribunal</a> [<em>New Times</em> report] in Arusha, Tanzania. The <a href="/paperchase/ErlinderDecision2.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] cites <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/rules/260600/index.htm">Rule 46 of the ICTR Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [text], which allows the tribunal to impose sanctions on lawyers guilty of misconduct, after giving the lawyer proper warning. Erlinder has claimed that he did not travel to the tribunal because his life is in danger and that he is on a reported hit list consisting of the opponents of Rwandan <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com/">President Paul Kagame</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/689405.stm">profile</a>]. The ICTR will replace Erlinder with another defense lawyer "as soon as possible." 

<p>Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga announced in October that Erlinder would be summoned to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-lawyer-to-face-charges-of-genocide-denial-in-rwanda.php">face charges of genocide denial</a> [JURIST report] in Rwanda, after Erlinder said that it was incorrect to place the blame for the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda%20genocide">news archive</a>] on one side. The appeals chamber of the ICTR released a decision earlier in October that <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ictr-denies-us-lawyer-immunity-from-rwanda-prosecution.php">allowed the Rwandan government to pursue charges</a> [JURIST report] against Erlinder. In a reversal of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-calls-for-release-of-us-lawyer-in-rwandan-custody.php">previous statement</a> [JURIST report], the ICTR decided that Erlinder was charged for actions committed outside the scope of his ICTR employment as a defense lawyer. Erlinder <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/lawyer-freed-from-rwanda-returns-to-us.php">returned to the US in June</a> after spending 21 days in a Rwandan prison following his <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-lawyer-arrested-in-rwanda-for-genocide-denial.php">arrest</a> [JURIST reports] on charges that he denied the genocide, and he has since been <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/africa/28rwanda.html">touring the US</a> [NYT report] and speaking about his experiences. A week before his return, the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/rwanda.htm#_The_Judiciary">High Court of Rwanda</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] had <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/us-lawyer-in-rwanda-custody-released-on-bail.php">released Erlinder on bail</a> due to persisting medical problems from what Rwandan officials say was a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/rwanda-officials-claim-detained-us-lawyer-attempted-suicide.php">suicide attempt</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit was brought by Missouri <a href="http://www.ltgov.mo.gov/">Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder</a> [official website] and six other citizens who alleged that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) violates provisions of both the US and Missouri constitutions. Judge Rodney Sippel dismissed the suit, finding that the plaintiffs lack standing:<blockquote>To whatever extent Plaintiffs allege an injury to the sovereign interests of the State of Missouri, they do not have standing to bring these claims because Plaintiffs, including Kinder, bring this case as individuals. As the Supreme Court has observed, a plaintiff "generally must assert his own legal rights and interests and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties." ... While the State of Missouri may have standing to assert the claim in Count I, it is not a party to this action and Plaintiff Kinder and the other Plaintiffs do not and cannot bring this action on behalf of Missouri.</blockquote>Kinder has said that he <a href="http://www.ltgov.mo.gov/press/042611JudgeSippel.htm">plans to file an appeal</a> [press release].

<p>Several other challenges to the PPACA have also been dismissed for lack of standing. Last week, a judge for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-healthcare-reform-act.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit, brought without an attorney by two New Jersey residents, on jurisdictional grounds, ruling the two men had no standing to challenge the law. In a similar ruling earlier in the month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.nhd.uscourts.gov/default.asp">US District Court for the District of New Hampshire</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] also challenging the law's constitutionality and held that the plaintiff, 80-year-old Harold Peterson, lacked standing because his Medicare coverage automatically satisfied the law's insurance mandate. In December, a judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] ruled that the minimum coverage provision of the health care reform law is <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] has also <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down the law</a>, while judges in <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">Michigan</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Virginia have upheld it</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, written by <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/District.aspx?District=14">Representative George Faught</a> (R) and <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/Senators/biographies/justice_bio.html">Senator Ron Justice</a> (R) [official profiles], makes it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants to hold jobs or apply for jobs in the state. In addition to criminalizing certain actions in relation to immigration status, the bill gives police more power to question an individual's immigration status if they suspect an individual is in the country illegally. It also repeals a law allowing illegal immigrants to qualify to pay in-state tuition costs at the state's public universities. The bill was approved by the <a href="http://newhouse.lsb.state.ok.us/">Oklahoma House</a> [official website] last month and will be sent to <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/">Governor Mary Fallin</a> (R) [official website] once differences between the House and Senate bills are reconciled. 

<p>This bill is just one of a number of legislative actions targeting illegal immigration that have been passed recently in many different states. Last year, Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=%27arizona+immigration%27">news archive</a>] that would require any individual suspected of being an illegal immigrant to present valid identification to law enforcement officials. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma Senate passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] last month. Within the past year, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] have also approved Arizona-style immigration laws. Despite their increased usage, these laws remain controversial. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] in July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] seeking to permanently enjoin the state's immigration law. The complaint states that the law is preempted by federal law and therefore violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] of the US Constitution. The Arizona law has been widely criticized in regard to the law's constitutionality and alleged "legalization" of racial profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Three others were <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/454568">sentenced to life in prison</a> [BNA report]. The killings were committed last month during mass anti-government protests. Rights activists have expressed concern that the verdict could <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE73R2UZ20110428">lead to intensified protests</a> [Reuters report] and violence. <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has condemned the trial as unfair, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/bahrain-urged-halt-execution-protesters-2011-04-28">urging a halt to the executions</a> [press release]. Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said:<blockquote>The Bahraini authorities have a responsibility to bring to justice those who commit violent crimes. But when doing so, they must uphold the right to fair trial and they must not use the death penalty under any circumstances. ... In this case, the accused were tried before a special military court, although they are civilians. It also appears that the trial was conducted behind closed doors. As well, those sentenced have no right of appeal except to another special military court, raising great fears about the fairness of the entire process.</blockquote>Lawyers for the defendants may appeal the verdict to the National Safety Court of Appeals.

<p>Earlier this month, human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized Bahrain  for rampant human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] related to anti-government protests. Last month, six <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">opposition leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in the capital of Manana. Days earlier, Bahraini King <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">three-month state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">called on the King to impose martial law</a> [JURIST report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. The Bahraini government's response to the ongoing protests have prompted international concern. In February, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under HB 1210, a physician must "[d]etermine in accordance with accepted medical standards the postfertilization age of the fetus and which trimester the pregnant woman receiving the abortion is in [and] determine whether the fetus is viable" prior to performing an abortion. If the fetus is determined to be beyond the 20 week fertilization period, the abortion is banned. The bill makes the performance of an abortion beyond 20 weeks a criminal act with the limited exception of a procedure deemed necessary to save the life of the mother. HB 1210 also effectively cuts all state funding to <a href="http://www.ppin.org/">Planned Parenthood of Indiana</a> [advocacy website]. The bill prohibits an agent of the state from making a contract with or granting funds to "any entity that performs abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed." The bill will be sent to <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/">Governor Mitch Daniels</a> [official website] for signature. Also Wednesday, the <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/">Florida House of Representatives</a> [official website] also passed <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=46206&SessionIndex=-1&SessionId=66&BillText=abortion%20ultrasound&BillNumber=&BillSponsorIndex=0&BillListIndex=0&BillStatuteText=&BillTypeIndex=0&BillReferredIndex=0&HouseChamber=H&BillSearchIndex=0">legislation</a> [HB 1127 materials] aimed at restricting abortion. HB 1127 mandates an ultrasound be performed, and that the resulting image be viewed by the pregnant woman, before she can seek an abortion. 

<p>The legislation in Indiana and Florida adds to the number of states that have recently passed similar legislation restricting the controversial procedure. <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports] have each passed legislation this year which restricts the abortion procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">Missouri</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports] have also recently passed legislation restricting late term abortions.

Cambodia has requested the clarification in order to "peacefully and definitely settle the boundary problem between [Cambodia and Thailand] in the area of the Temple of Preah Vihear." Parts of the Cambodia-Thailand border have never been formally demarcated, which has led to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12398184">border disputes</a> [BBS report]. In response to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-sg-calls-for-ceasefire-in-thailand-cambodia-clash.php">latest border clash</a> [JURIST report], UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22Ban+Ki-moon%22">news archive</a>] stressed that the dispute could <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5218">not be resolved through military force</a> [statement] and urged both sides to continue working towards a ceasefire.

<p>Cambodia's border with Vietnam has also been a point of controversy. Early last month, Cambodian opposition leader <a href="http://www.samrainsyparty.org/about/about_sam_rainsy.htm">Sam Rainsy</a> [party profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22Sam+Rainsy%22">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/cambodia-court-rejects-opposition-leaders-final-appeal.php">lost his final appeal</a> in the Cambodian Supreme Court on <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-group-criticizes-cambodia.php">charges</a> [JURIST reports] of intentionally destroying posts marking the Cambodia-Vietnam border and inciting racial discrimination. The ruling was given <em>in absentia</em> because Rainsy has been in self-imposed exile since 2005. At the hearing, Rainsy's representative stated that this was a political issue, not a criminal one. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-group-criticizes-cambodia.php">criticized the ruling</a> [JURIST report] as demonstrating the government's control over the judiciary.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a 2-1 vote by a three-judge panel, the court concluded that those opposing the funding had not shown that their case was likely to succeed on the merits. Additionally, the court gave considerable weight to the inequity that the injunction would impose on researchers who rely on federal funding<blockquote>The hardship a preliminary injunction would impose
upon ... researchers ... would be certain and substantial. The injunction entered by the district court would preclude the NIH [National Institutes of Health] from funding new ... projects it has or would have deemed meritorious, thereby inevitably denying other scientists funds they would have received. Even more
problematic, the injunction would bar further disbursements to ... researchers who have already begun multi-year projects in reliance upon a grant from the NIH; their investments in project planning would be a loss, their expenditures for equipment a waste, and their staffs out of a job.</blockquote>The Obama administration considers the ruling a major victory that will allow for scientists and patients around the world to benefit from the medical developments and discoveries that will arise from the research. 

<p>Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research has been a long uphill battle for the Obama administration. In 2009, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/09/A-debt-of-gratitude-to-so-many-tireless-advocates/">signed</a> [press release] an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Removing-Barriers-to-Responsible-Scientific-Research-Involving-Human-Stem-Cells/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-reverses-stem-cell-research-ban.php">report</a>] which removed the previous administration's eight-year restriction on federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research. After the preliminary injunction on stem research was granted last year, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/obama-administration-appeals-stem-cell-research-block.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the injunction, arguing that the ruling was overbroad, endangering an array of research across multiple programs and centers while only serving a very attenuated economic interest of the plaintiffs in the case. While the appeals process was underway, the court granted a long-term stay which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-appeals-court-lifts-stem-cell-research-ban.php">allowed federal funding to continue</a> [JURIST report] while the court reached a decision. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, the council has immediately called for a full investigation of "all alleged violations of international human rights law" in Syria. The council's probe into Syrian violence is a direct <a href="http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&b=1316871&ct=9375507">endorsement of a US resolution</a> [press release] calling for intervention in Syria to address more than 500 deaths since March. The resolution also calls for Syria to release arbitrarily detained prisoners, to allow humanitarian assistance to those in need and to evaluate its political process to allow for greater social justice and civil liberties. The resolution passed with a 26 to 9 member state vote. Seven member states did not vote, and five were absent from the session. 

<p>There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year.  Last week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">called for Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also last week, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad </a>[Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">stopped medical personnel</a> [JURIST report], sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Last month, Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence. As demonstrations continued throughout the country in March, the government <a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/queensland/a/-/world/9081491/syria-frees-260-detainees-in-overture-to-protesters/">freed 260 political detainees</a> [AFP report] in an overture to the protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Egypt's Justice Minister Mohammed al-Gindi <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hFXGXjmeqea9wZuRkPB6RbFmQ7_g?docId=CNG.8c42f3c8127e494787a7578a617196fb.771">told</a> [AP report] <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/"><em>al-Ahram</em> weekly</a> [official website] that Mubarak would face either the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted. Mubarak is also <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2011/1043/eg1.htm">facing charges</a> [<em>Ahram</em> report] of corruption and embezzlement of public funds. Zakaria Shalash, head judge of the Cairo Court of Appeals, said this month that Mubarak <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2011/1044/eg5.htm">may face execution</a> [Ahram report] and that testimony of former Egyptian interior minister Habib el-Adly, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12841111">on trial</a> [BBC report] for killing protesters, could help prove Mubarak was an accomplice to the killings. However, if the prosecution cannot prove that the ordered killings were premeditated, a life sentence will likely be imposed. Mubarak is currently being detained at Sharm el-Sheikh International Hospital after he was hospitalized for heart trouble shortly after his <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">resignation</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this week, public prosecutor Abdel-Maguid Mahmoud <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-orders-mubarak-to-prison-hospital.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the transfer of Mubarak to a prison hospital in Cairo, but he was <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-04/27/c_13847229.htm">deemed unfit for travel</a> [Xinhua report]. 

<p>Last month, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused the former president</a> [JURIST report] and the country's police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations in Egypt early this year. The joint commission submitted their report to Egypt's top prosecutor for further investigation. The Supreme Military Council of Egypt, which assumed power after Mubarak's resignation, instructed Egypt's top prosecutor to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110323/163161631.html">investigate the death of protesters</a> [RIA Novosti report] during the three weeks of demonstrations in the country.

The AEPA denies workers the right to unionize and engage in collective bargaining. The court determined by an 8-1 margin that the APEA does not violate the workers' freedom of association because workers are still permitted to form associations in order to bring grievances to employers. The decision overturned a <a href="http://www.ufcw.ca/Theme/UFCW/files/UFCW%20vs%20Ontario%2017Nov2008/UFCW%20v%20Ontario-Court%20of%20Appeal%20decision-17Nov2008.pdf">2008 decision</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Court of Appeal for Ontario</a> [official website] finding that the AEPA was in violation of the right and ordered the legislature to create a new law. Representatives for the respondent, <a href="http://www.ufcw.ca/">United Food &#38; Commercial Workers Union</a> (UFCW) [official website], <a href="http://www.ufcw.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2340%3Arights-of-ontario-farm-workers-abandoned-by-supreme-court&catid=6%3Adirections-newsletter&Itemid=316&lang=en">stated</a> [press release] that they intend to focus on lobbying efforts to change the law and protect workers from rights abuses:<blockquote>The reality is that appealing to the courts has ended. Appealing to the decency and the will of voters is next. This is also a political issue. Most Canadians would be appalled at the working and living conditions of tens of thousands of Ontario agriculture workers. ... There is an Ontario election coming and we and our allies and members will make this an issue.</blockquote>The UFCW has been engaged in litigation regarding farm workers' rights to unionize since 1995, after the Ontario legislature repealed the short-lived <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/repealedstatutes/english/elaws_rep_statutes_94a06_e.htm">Agricultural Labour Relations Act of 1994</a> [text] that gave workers the right to unionize and engage in collective bargaining. In its place, the legislature enacted the Labour Relations and <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/source/statutes/english/2005/elaws_src_s05015_e.htm">Employment Statute Law Amendment Act</a> (LRESLAA) [text] denying these rights, but the Supreme Court of Canada issued a <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/2001/2001scc94/2001scc94.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] in 2001 finding the act infringed on freedom of association and ordered new legislation. The legislature enacted the AEPA shortly thereafter in 2002.

<p>Public unions' rights to engage in collective bargaining has become a major issue in the US as well. Earlier this month, Wisconsin's attorney general <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/wisconsin-ag-sues-judge-calls-for-supreme-court-intervention.php">filed a Petition for Supervisory Writ to the Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] claiming that a circuit court judge did not have the constitutional authority to issue a restraining order to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">temporarily block publication</a> [JURIST report] of the state's <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11 text, PDF]. The original lawsuit alleged that Republican lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">did not follow the state's open meetings law</a> [JURIST report] when passing the legislation. The court order was issued in response to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-union-bargaining-bill-may-become-law-despite-judicial-order.php">debate among government officials</a> [JURIST report] that the law, which strips public unions of the vast majority of their collective bargaining rights, went into effect after it was published on the Wisconsin Legislative Bureau's website. Last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ohio-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">Ohio Senate passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that alters Ohio labor law and restricts the collective bargaining abilities of unions and public sector workers. Governor John Kasich <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/03/gov_john_kasich_signs_senate_b.html">signed the bill into law</a> [<em>Plain Dealer</em> report] at the end of March. Opponents of the bill have begun a campaign to put the issue to a vote by placing a referendum on the November ballot. Several other states are considering similar legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontutah.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/index.html">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] announced on Friday that the state of Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/news_media/article.html?article=4745">filed a complaint</a> [statement] in the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] against the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) [official website] regarding an order issued by <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] in December.  <a href="http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&PageID=115974">Secretarial Order 3310</a> [text, PDF] created a new "Wild Lands" designation for public lands and provided that the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en.html">Bureau of Land Management</a> (BLM) [official website] would maintain an inventory of "lands with wilderness characteristics" within its jurisdiction and integrate the information into decisions regarding land use and management. The order further stated that the BLM should provide recommendations to Congress for designations of areas into the <a href="http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/boundaries/a_nwps.html">National Wilderness Preservation System</a> [background materials]. The complaint alleges that the order violates provisions of the <a href="http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA), the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sup_01_5_10_I_30_5.html">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) and the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/flpma/FLPMA.pdf">Federal Land Policy Management Act</a> (FLPMA) [text] by not following proper procedures for notice and rulemaking and is outside of the DOI's legal authority. Hebert relayed his concerns that the implementation of the order would have a negative impact on Utah's economy by hindering land use and development:<blockquote>In Utah, we have beautiful and resource-rich land. Our lands have supported both a strong energy development industry and a vibrant outdoor recreation industry for years. They can continue to do so if all stakeholders are allowed to collaborate within a proper legal framework to determine the best use for our lands. ... Corporations will not invest the time or resources to prepare new bids and engage in new explorations in an unsteady regulatory environment. This order is bad policy, it's bad for Utah, and it's bad for the entire nation.</blockquote>The complaint asks the district court to void the order, set aside any BLM manuals created pursuant to the order and prevent the DOI from issuing any further orders that would infringe on any existing BLM management plans.

<p>This is not the first time a district court has been called upon to settle a dispute over wilderness protection. In February, the <a href="http://www.id.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Idaho</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-idaho-forest-management-plan.php">dismissed a lawsuit brought by environmentalists</a> [JURIST report] that challenged the state's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=roadless+rule">"roadless rule"</a> [JURIST news archive] to manage and protect its nine million acres of forests. The <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/">National Forest Service</a> (NFS) [official website] issued the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTFzMTAwjQL8h2VAQAJp-nEg!!/?ss=119930&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&navid=091000000000000&pnavid=null&ttype=roadmain&cid=FSE_003853&position=RELATEDLINKS&pname=Roadless-Home">Roadless Area Conservation Act</a> [text] in 2001, which prohibited the building of roads or the use of roadless lands in National Parks for timber production. The act is currently in force in all states except Idaho and Alaska. Environmentalists argued that Idaho's version of the rule provided less protection than its federal counterpart. In February 2010, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-upholds-rule-limiting.php">granted summary judgment</a> [JURIST report] for the NFS, upholding an agreement limiting the amount of timber that can be harvested in Alaska's Tongass National Forest. Several Alaska towns and companies challenged the 2008 forest plan, which, among other things, designated parts of the forest "old growth reserves," limiting the amount of timber that could be harvested.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE74000420110501?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">criticized</a> [Reuters report] the government's treatment of Bezigye during his arrest last Thursday, during which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13246913">video shows government forces breaking into his SUV</a> [BBC report], shooting pepper spray directly into his face and forcing him into the back of a pickup truck. Reports indicate Bezigye has left the country for medical treatment due to the arrest and has not fully regained sight in his left eye. Demonstrations intensified following Besigye's arrest, leading to eight deaths and more than 90 injuries. Pillay called on both sides to refrain from using violence. Besigye said Sunday that he will <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Kenyanews/Defiant-Besigye-vows-to-continue-protests-12608.html">continue to organize</a> [<em>Capital News</em> report] the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Ugandas-Walk-To-Work-Protests-Will-Continue-says-Activist-120003879.html">"Walk to Work" protests</a> [VOA report]&#8212;so called because protesters refuse to drive due to high fuel prices&#8212;despite the violence. More protests are expected Monday.

<p>Government officials had <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/jurist-1.php">arrested Besigye three times</a> [JURIST report] in April prior to Thursday's arrest. Besigye is the leader of the Uganda's most prominent opposition party, the <a href="http://www.fdcuganda.org/index.html">Forum for Democratic Change</a> [official website]. He lost to incumbent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1196167.stm">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [BBC profile] in elections held this past February. The elections were <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/20/ugandan-leader-wins-presidential-election">criticized by the opposition as fraudulent</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Besigye also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11524243">ran for president</a> [BBC report] in 2002 and 2006, and, prior to that, he was Museveni's personal doctor. In October 2010, Uganda's Constitutional Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uganda-court-dismisses-treason-case-against-opposition-leader.php">dismissed treason charges</a> [JURIST report] against Besigye and 10 co-defendants, ruling that there was insufficient evidence and that the state had violated the defendants' rights.

A final ruling is <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9MTFOJG0.htm">expected within the next two weeks</a> [Bloomberg report]. Last month, Judge James Selna agreed to dismiss economic damage claims from foreign Toyota buyers, citing a lack of standing.

<p>In December, Toyota <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/toyota-agrees-to-pay-additional-32-million-in-fines-to-us-government.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] US federal investigations by agreeing to pay a record $32.4 million in extra fines for product defects and poor handling of a recall. The fines stem from two investigations conducted by the <a href="http://www.dot.gov/affairs/2010/dot7110.htm">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA) [official website]. The first, a fine of $16.375 million, concerned nearly five million vehicles with accelerator pedals entrapped by floor mats, which caused at least one fatal accident in California. The second, a fine of $16.050 million, resulted from Toyota's failure to notify the NHTSA of a safety defect in several Toyota models' steering relay rods. Toyota has been under federal scrutiny since December 2009, and has conducted several recalls. Toyota's product recalls have been analyzed by Forum guest columnist Bruce Aronson of Creighton University School of Law in the op-ed <a href="/forumy/2010/02/learning-from-toyotas-troubles-wheres.php">Learning from Toyota's Troubles - Where's the Board?</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wyoming</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-disclosure-of-drug-reactions.php">report</a>] for Wyoming in a dispute with Montana over water rights to the Tongue and Powder rivers. Montana claimed that Wyoming violated the <a href="http://yrcc.usgs.gov/support.docs/YellowstoneRiverCompact.pdf">Yellowstone River Compact</a> [text, PDF; <a target="_blank" href="http://yrcc.usgs.gov/YRCC%20-%20Compact%20and%20Commission%20Information.htm">materials</a>], which allocates water rights to the two Yellowstone River tributaries, by allowing the construction of water storage facilities and the expansion of irrigation. In 2008, the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/102008zor.pdf">appointed</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-appoints-special-master.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/special_master">special master</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to investigate and oversee the lawsuit, which was filed directly in the Supreme Court, as it has <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleiii.html">original</a> [Article III, Section 2 text] and <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001251----000-.html">exclusive jurisdiction</a> [28 USC 1251 text] over disputes between states. In his <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_137_Orig_InterimReportofSpecialMaster.authcheckdam.pdf">first interim report</a> [text, PDF], the special master determined that Montana failed to state a claim because more efficient irrigation systems are permissible under the compact so long as the conserved water is used to irrigate the same acreage watered in 1950. The court agreed, and, in an opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, overruled Montana's exception to that conclusion:<blockquote>We conclude that the plain terms of the Compact protect ordinary "[a]ppropriative rights to the beneficial uses of [water] ... existing in each signatory State as of January 1, 1950." ... And the best evidence we have shows that the doctrine of appropriation in Wyoming and Montana allows appropriators to improve the efficiency of their irrigation systems, even to the detriment of downstream appropriators. Montana's allegation that Wyoming has breached Article V(A) of the Compact by allowing its pre-1950 water users to increase their irrigation efficiency thus fails to state a claim. Accordingly, Montana's first exception to the Special Master's First Interim Report is overruled.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia dissented. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision.

<p>Also Monday, the court issued a <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-1000.pdf"><em>per curiam</em> opinion</a> [text, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bobby-v-mitts/">Bobby v. Mitts</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder]. The court reversed the decision of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which had ruled in favor of an Ohio death row inmate. Relying on it's decision last year in <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-reverses-sixth-circuit-in.php">Smith v. Spisak</a> [JURIST report], the court ruled that the jury instructions did not violate the defendant's rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-dead">announced</a> [statement] Sunday night that earlier in the day a small team of US military personnel attacked a compound in which al Qaeda leader <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/osama-bin-laden-killed-leader-of-terrorist-group-al-qaeda-was-53/2010/09/21/AFqrZ0VF_story.html">Osama Bin Laden</a> [WP obituary; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">news archive</a>] had been hiding, killing Bin Laden and taking possession of his body. Bin Laden had <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/usama-bin-laden/view">topped the US list of Most Wanted Terrorists</a> [FBI backgrounder] and is believed to have approved or helped plan many notorious terror attacks including those against New York and Washington DC on <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11, 2001</a>, the 2000 bombing of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22uss+cole%22">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archives], <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania</a> [PBS backgrounder] in 1998 and the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-05-03-reaction-bin-laden-death_n.htm">Celebrations broke out across the US</a> [USA Today report] as people learned the news of the al Qaeda leader's death, with large gatherings in front of the White House and at the former site of the World Trade Center. Political leaders across the globe <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13256956">expressed relief</a> [BBC report] at Bin Laden's death. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov">Department of State</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_5447.html">worldwide travel alert</a> [text] following Obama's announcement, urging US citizens abroad to be vigilant of their surroundings and recommending that those in areas of strong anti-American sentiment stay inside or close to their homes or hotels and avoid large gatherings. The alert also warned that some US embassies may adjust their schedules and services or even shut down briefly.

As founder and leader of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive], Bin Laden represents the highest profile terror target captured or killed by the US. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced that alleged former al Qaeda chief in the Arabian Peninsula and accused mastermind of the USS Cole bombing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive] will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/accused-uss-cole-bomber-to-be-tried-in-military-court.php">tried in a military court</a> [JURIST report] rather than in a civilian criminal court. Also last month, US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12964158">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>], a high-ranking al Qaeda member whom US officials say was principally responsible for planning the 9/11 attacks, will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried by a military tribunal</a> [JURIST report] as well. Mohammed has also <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-claims-pearl.php">admitted involvement in the 2002 beheading</a> [JURIST report] of US journalist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=">Daniel Pearl</a> [JURIST news archive], the 2002 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">Bali nightclub bombing</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=">news archive</a>] and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The detention and treatment of accused al Qaeda members held at <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] has <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/aclu-calls-on-ag-to-investigate-bush-for-torture.php">generated controversy in the US</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/spain-court-allows-guantanamo-torture-investigation-to-continue.php">throughout the world</a> [JURIST reports].]]></content:encoded>

Another law that went into effect Sunday adds harsher penalties, including possibility of the death penalty, for producers of tainted food.

The 300-page <a href = "http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=218816">appeal includes requests</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] that Katsav's prison term be postponed until after his appeal as well as for the court to show "special consideration" in deference to Katsav's former status as a state figure. The <A href = "http://elyon1.court.gov.il/heb/cv/fe_html_out/courts/details/310.htm">Tel Aviv District Court</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/former-israel-president-convicted-of-rape.php">convicted Katsav</a> [JURIST report] in December, finding that he assaulted a female employee of the Department of Tourism during his time as minister and two women at the President's Residence during his time as president. Katsav's appeal puts forth that his relationship with the female employee was consensual and the trying judiciary was biased against him due to the media's pervasiveness during the trial. Although the appeal has not been made public, Katsav's defense team has requested the Supreme Court release all documents surrounding it. A decision on the document release is expected for Thursday.

<p>Katsav was initially <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/israel-ex-president-indicted-on-rape.php">indicted on rape charges</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 for allegedly assaulting female employees in the 1990s. In 2008, Katsav <a href = "/paperchase/2008/04/israel-ex-president-rejects-plea.php">rejected a plea agreement</a> [JURIST report] that would have permitted him to plead guilty to lesser charges of indecent assault, sexual harassment and obstruction of justice in exchange for a suspended sentence and the dropping of rape charges. The plea deal had been <a href = "/paperchase/2007/07/israel-high-court-puts-katsav-plea.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by women's and civil rights activists, prompting five separate petitions to overturn the agreement. </p>]]></content:encoded>

US citizen Menachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem in 2002. His parents asked the State Department to record his place of birth as Jerusalem, Israel, but were told it could only be listed as Jerusalem because the US does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. His parents filed suit in 2003, and a federal district court dismissed the suit as a political question.

<p>The court also agreed to decide in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-948.htm">CompuCredit Corp. v.

The case arises from a dispute between consumers and companies that issue low-rate credit cards to people with bad credit. The consumers filed a lawsuit over credit card fees, and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/08/17/09-15906.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that they had a right to sue in federal court rather than face arbitration. There is a circuit split on the issue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Turabi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/sudanese-security-forces-arrest-opposition-leader.php">jailed</a> [JURIST report] for calling on the Sudanese people to start a popular uprising, similar to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tunisia">Tunisia</a> [JURIST news archive]. Al-Turabi, the Islamist leader of the Popular Congress Party (PCP), said that he was <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudanese-government-releases,38766">not interrogated or made aware of his charges</a> [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> report] while in prison.

Al-Turabi explained that his detention demonstrates the ruling National Congress Party's (NCP) violation of Sudanese laws. Sudanese law allows for a person to be arrested without charge for 45 days before either being charged or released.

<p>The January arrests of al-Turabi and eight other opposition party members came after the PCP called for a popular uprising in protest of price increases on various goods. The party officials called for a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/18/us-sudan-referendum-idUSTRE70G1CE20110118">popular revolution</a> [Reuters report] if Khartoum did not reduce prices. Additionally, the opposition party was pressuring the government to remove its financial minister and dismantle parliament. The arrests coincided with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/icc02050109?lan=en-GB">President Omar Hassan al-Bashir</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] apparently losing control of the oil-producing southern region of Sudan as a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/sudan-referendum-voters-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-secession.php">referendum</a> [JURIST report] passed the week before. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The list is composed of 38 world leaders and organizations, including Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile], Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile, and Yemeni <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic], whose countries have been engulfed in the recent wave of protests across the region. RSF said:<blockquote>Freedom of expression has been one of the first demands of the region's peoples, one of the first concessions from transitional regimes, and one of the first achievements, albeit a very fragile one, of its revolutions. Attempts to manipulate foreign reporters, arbitrary arrests and detention, deportation, denial of access, intimidation and threats&#8212;the list of abuses against the media during the Arab Spring is staggering. ... Journalist[s] have been direct[ly] targeted by the authorities or caught in the crossfire of the violence between activists and security forces, reminding us of the risks they take to perform their essential job of reporting the news.</blockquote>Other predators of press freedom include Spain's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eta">ETA</a>, the government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iran">Iran</a> and the government of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china">China</a>. The RSF release coincides with <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38250&Cr=press+freedom&Cr1=">World Press Freedom Day</a> [UN News Centre report].

<p>Last month, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials].

Ocampo indicated that the plans were made in response to the conflicts in Tunisia and Egypt and included shooting civilians. In March, Ocampo told the press that he is 100 percent certain his office will <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-certain-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-charges.php">bring charges</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontholocaust.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The lawyer for accused Nazi guard <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] called for acquittal Tuesday as he presented his closing arguments in a German courtroom. Defense lawyer Ulrich Busch also argued that Demjanjuk should be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/03/us-germany-demjanjuk-trial-idUSTRE7423TO20110503">awarded damages for false imprisonment</a> [Reuters report]. Demjanjuk is accused of helping murder Jews at the Sobidor death camp during the Holocaust, but his lawyers claim the prosecution has produced no evidence to show his guilt. The defense is expected to finish its closing arguments within the next week. In March, the prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-prosecutor-requests-6-year-sentence-for-alleged-nazi-guard.php">called for a six-year sentence</a> [JURIST report]. A verdict is expected later this month. 

<p>Demjanjuk's trial, which began in November 2009, has been marked by extensive delay. Last May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss the charges</a> [JURIST report] filed by the defense, which argued there was a lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the argument, saying they found the evidence against Demjanjuk to be strong.

Pirates Cabdiweli Cabdullahi and Raageggesey Hassan Aji were apprehended by Spanish officials when they sailed away from the Alakran and were brought to Madrid for trial instead of the usual venue in Africa. Though the court found that the Spanish government paid USD $3.3 million in ransom to release the boat and the 36 crew members held for 47 days, Spain's <a href="http://www.maec.es/en/MenuPpal/Ministerio/LaMinistra/Biografia/Paginas/biografia.aspx">Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiminez</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/d9n02bjo0/spain-gives-2-somalis-439-years-in-prison-for-hijacking-boat-says-ransom-was-paid.html">adamantly denies the finding</a> [AP report]. The hefty sentence stems from illegally detaining 36 crew members in addition to 11 years for each count of piracy.  However, court officials have indicated that the maximum time each pirate will serve is likely not more than 30 years.

<p>Last month, a US district court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">sentenced a Somali pirate to 25 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in attacking a Danish ship, as well as the US Navy's USS Ashland. In November, a federal jury in Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] five Somali men on charges of piracy for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nichols. In August, piracy charges against six defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

OAS Secretary General Jose Miguel Insulza was <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/media_center/press_release.asp?sCodigo=E-647/11">satisfied with the decision</a> [press release], saying it "puts an end to the situation of uncertainty regarding the legal situation of the former leader that began after the coup."

The bill, which has been compared to the <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">Arizona immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in March by <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] and requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. The lawsuit claims that the law unconstitutionally interferes with federal powers over immigration enforcement and violates the Fourth Amendment search and seizure provision and the Equal Protection clause of the US Constitution. According to the complaint:<blockquote>If allowed to take effect, HB 497 will significantly harm Utahans, particularly Utahans of color. According to law enforcement officials in Utah and elsewhere, HB 497 will cause widespread racial profiling and will subject many persons of color&#8212;including countless U.S. citizens and non-citizens who have federal permission to remain in the United States&#8212;to unlawful interrogations, searches, seizures, and arrests. People of color in the state will be compelled to carry additional paperwork on them at all times in order to prove to law enforcement officials that their presence in the country is approved by the federal government.</blockquote>The suit was filed in the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> on behalf of several organizations, including Utah Coalition of La Raza, Service Employees International Union, Latin American Chamber of Commerce, Workers' United Rocky Mountain Joint Board, Centro Civico Mexicano, and  Coalition of Utah Progressives.

<p>Several other state legislatures have also acted recently to implement so-called "Arizona style" immigration laws. Last month, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] to revoke tax credits from businesses that hire illegal immigrants and require the use of the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-verify System</a> [official website] to check the eligibility status of employees. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx">Georgia General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved a bill</a> requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone they have probable cause to believe has committed a criminal offense and requiring businesses to use E-Verify to check the immigration status of potential employees. Similar legislation has also been approved in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] US Attorney Preet Bharara filed a <a href="http://4closurefraud.org/2011/05/03/complaint-united-state-of-america-vs-deutsche-bank-and-mortgageit-inc/">civil suit</a> [complaint] on Tuesday against <a href="http://www.db.com/index_e.htm">Deutsche Bank</a> [corporate website] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] accusing the bank of engaging in mortgage fraud. Through the suit, the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/03/us-deutschebank-mortgage-lawsuit-idUSTRE7423LY20110503">US seeks more than $1 billion</a> [Reuters report], including punitive damages and fines. Specifically, the complaint alleges that, from 1999 to 2009, Deutsche Bank consistently lied to the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/federal_housing_administration">Federal Housing Administration</a> (FHA) [official website] in order to obtain and maintain the Direct Endorsement Lender (DEL) status of its subsidiary, MorrgageIT. Through the DEL program, private lenders are granted authority to endorse mortgages that are qualified for FHA insurance. As part of its participation in the program, a lender is responsible for carefully reviewing mortgages for eligibility and is required to implement a quality control plan to provide procedures for correcting any problems in a lender's underwriting operations. The US argues that during the 10-year period in which MortgageIT acted as a DEL, it endorsed more than 39,000 mortgages for FHA insurance while failing not only to abide by the eligibility rules set forth by the program, but also to implement quality control procedures:<blockquote>For instance, Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT failed to audit MortgageIT's early payment defaults; Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT failed to dedicate sufficient staff to quality control; MortgageIT repeatedly failed to address dysfunctions in the quality control system, which were reported to upper management; MortgageIT took the only staff member dedicated to auditing FHA-insured mortgages, and reassigned him to increase production instead; and when an outside auditor provided findings to MortgageIT revealing serious problems, those findings were literally stuffed in a closet and left unread and unopened.</blockquote>The suit is being viewed as the latest attempt by the US to redress the financial crisis and punish those it views as responsible.

<p>Last month, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that the former CEO of mortgage company <a href="https://www.taylorbean.com/default.aspx">Taylor, Bean &#38; Whitaker</a> (TBW) [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bankrupt-mortgage-company-ceo-pleads-guilty-to-15-billion-fraud-scheme.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] on charges of fraud related to the <a href="http://www.financialstability.gov/">Troubled Asset Relief Program</a> (TARP) [materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=TARP">news archive</a>]. Paul Allen pleaded guilty to making false statements and conspiring to commit bank and wire fraud for his role in a USD $1.5 billion fraud scheme that contributed to the failure of the mortgage company. Allen admitted that from 2005 through August 2009 he and other co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud financial institutions that had invested in a lending facility called Ocala Funding. In an effort to cover up inadequate assets backing its commercial paper, Allen told a co-conspirator to produce fraudulent reports and knew that these reports were sent to Ocala Funding investors and other third parties. The cover-up led investors in <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a>, <a href="http://www.colonialbankfsb.com/">Colonial Bank</a> [corporate websites] and Ocala Funding to believe they had an undivided ownership interest in thousands of the same mortgage loans. Allen also admitted to making false statements in a letter to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, omitting concerns raised by an independent auditor. Five other individuals have pleaded guilty for their roles in related fraud schemes. Allen, who faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each count, will be sentenced in June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/05/02/thailand-investigate-abuses-connected-political-violence">details the violence</a> [press release] that resulted from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8004306.stm">"red shirt"</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=red+shirt">news archive</a>] pro-democracy movement and specifically from clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters acting under the direction of the <a href="http://www.uddthailand.com/">United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship</a> (UDD) [party website]. According to investigations by HRW, the high death toll and injuries were the consequences of excessive and unnecessary lethal force by the government as well as deliberate attacks, aimed at inciting more violence, by armed forces of the UDD. The information within the report is based on 94 interviews with victims, witnesses and government officials, among others. One witness account described such behavior:<blockquote>[M]edic volunteers who were tending the wounded inside the temple compound were amongst those killed. These included a nurse who was shot while tending to a wounded man near the nursing station at the front of the temple, and 22-year-old man who was fatally shot in the head and body inside the medical tent after providing first aid to the nurse.</blockquote>Based on these findings, HRW made a number of key recommendations to the government of Thailand within the report, including the immediate initiation of an "impartial, transparent, and independent inquiry into the violence" to "ensure all perpetrators of serious human rights abuses are brought to justice" as well as providing "prompt, fair and adequate compensation for the victims ... of human rights violations."

<p>HRW is not the only voice calling for more information. In January, the "red shirt" movement <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/thailand-red-shirts-petition-icc-to-review-violence-during-bangkok-protests.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to launch a preliminary investigation into whether the government committed crimes against humanity during the Bangkok protests. The application for petition cites specific evidence developing a substantial basis to show that international crimes of murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivation of physical liberty, other inhumane acts, and persecution were committed in conjunction with the suppression of red shirt protests. Evidence obtained from multiple active-duty officers of the Royal Thai Army recounts the planning and execution of the military response to the red shirts. The application also includes reports from Thai law enforcement officials knowledgeable of the official investigation conducted by the Thai Department of Special Investigations (DSI) into the killings of protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/ag/speeches/2011/ag-speech-110504.html">prepared statement</a> [text], Holder said:<blockquote>Three days ago&#8212;thanks to many dedicated military and civilian leaders; intelligence and law enforcement officers; diplomats and policymakers; investigators, prosecutors and counterterrorism experts&#8212;the decade-long manhunt for Osama bin Laden came to a successful end. This historic achievement was a tremendous step forward in attaining justice for the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans who were murdered on September 11, 2001. And I hope it will inspire a renewed commitment to collaboration - across party lines, branches of responsibility, and agencies&#8212;so that we can effectively address the most pressing challenges facing the American people.</blockquote>Holder also expressed concerns that Bin Laden's death may prompt attempts at retaliation.

<p>Last week, Holder announced that the Department of Justice's priorities will include <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/doj-to-focus-on-terrorism-financial-fraud-holder.php">protecting Americans from terrorism</a> [JURIST report] at home and abroad, fighting violent crime, combating financial fraud and protecting the most vulnerable members of society. The speech came on the heels of Holder's failed attempts to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">try the 9/11 conspirators in civil trials</a> [JURIST report] in New York. Holder announced last month that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report]. Holder referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US.

The court <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20110504_2bvr236509.html">held</a> [judgment, in German] that the laws governing the practice of extending prison terms for prisoners deemed to be a public safety threat violates provisions of the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bundesrecht/gg/gesamt.pdf">German constitution</a> [text, PDF, in German]. "[T]he provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention beyond the former ten-year maximum period and on the retrospective imposition of preventive detention in criminal law relating to adult and to juvenile offenders infringe the rule-of-law precept of the protection of legitimate expectations." The court said that the country's current preventive detention laws infringe the constitutional minimum distance requirement for preventative detentions in that they are not sufficiently distinguished from normal prison terms. The distance requirement mandates that "the deprivation of liberty effected by preventive detention must keep a marked distance from the execution of a prison sentence." The court did not impose an outright ban on all preventative detention, but rather set narrow guidelines for the German parliament, the <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/index.jsp">Bundestag</a> [official website, in German], to follow in designing a law which emphasizes the "liberty-oriented execution aimed at therapy [and] which clearly shows to the detainee under preventive detention and to the general public the purely preventive character of the measure." The current preventative detention laws will remain in place until parliament passes new legislation. The court set a deadline of May 2013 by which the legislature must enact new legislation. 

<p>In other countries, controversial laws pertaining to the preventative detention of prisoners deemed a threat to public safety have also come under fire. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/amnesty-international-concerned-about-extrajudicial-detentions-in-jammu-and-kashmir.php">rights groups called for reform</a> [JURIST report] of a Kashmir law they allege is being used to detain people despite the absence of sufficient evidence for a trial. Last year, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/077671A.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously that a federal law allowing for the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-appeals-court-upholds-indefinite-detention-of-mentally-ill-sex-offenders.php">indefinite detention of mentally ill sex offenders was constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo said he has found evidence that Libya began hiring mercenaries as early as January in anticipation of protests after <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Middle+East+revolution">unrest began in the Middle East</a> [JURIST news archive]. According to the chief prosecutor, those mercenaries have been used against protesters, resulting in the deaths of thousands. Regarding war crimes, the chief prosecutor claims to have uncovered evidence of the use of "cluster munitions, multiple rocket launchers and mortars, and other forms of heavy weaponry, in crowded urban areas, in particular Misrata. There are also reports of forces blocking humanitarian supplies ... the use of civilians as human shields and the torture of prisoners of war or civilians."<blockquote>The evidence collected establishes reasonable grounds to believe that widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population have been and continue to be committed in Libya, including murder and persecution as crimes against humanity. Additionally and since the end of February, there has been an armed conflict in Libya. In this context, there is also relevant information on the alleged commission of war crimes.</blockquote>Moreno-Ocampo will present his evidence to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Chambers/Pre+Trial+Division/">Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC</a> [official website] and request warrants be issued for three individuals. Those individuals were not named in the statement.

<p>In March, the ICC announced it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the recent violence in Libya. The ICC was given jurisdiction over the current situation in Libya by <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://uk.ibtimes.com/articles/116663/20110227/un-resolution-libya-sanctions-original-text-un-resolution-1970-2011.htm">Resolution 1970</a> [text]. Also in March, the UN Security Council voted <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37633&Cr=Libya&Cr1=">unanimously</a> [press release] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">impose sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi, marking the first unanimous referral to the ICC in UN history. Resolution 1970 also received support from Libya's delegation itself, which <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110225/wl_nm/us_libya_rights_envoy">renounced Gaddafi</a> [Reuters report]. Subsequently, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">suspend Libya</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in response to the violent suppression of peaceful protesters by forces loyal to Gaddafi. According to a statement issued by the court, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-no-immunity-for-perpetrators-of-crimes-against-humanity-in-libya.php">ICC will not grant immunity</a> [JURIST report] to any person perpetrating crimes against humanity in Libya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Twenty-six states, led by Florida and the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website], argue that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] by requiring all Americans over the age of 18 to purchase individual health insurance plans by 2014. In the brief, the states argued that if the mandatory insurance provision is deemed unconstitutional, the entire law must be struck down as unconstitutional:<blockquote>The mandate and related insurance regulations are the heart of a sprawling and complex legislative compromise, and there is no chance the Act&#8212;in anything resembling its current form&#8212;would have been enacted in their absence. The standard for non-severability is well established. After a court strikes a statute's unconstitutional provisions, the 'remaining provisions' must be invalidated where 'it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions ... independently of that which is invalid'.</blockquote> The Eleventh Circuit denied the petition for initial hearing <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/eleventh-circuit-declines-full-panel-hearing-of-health-care-appeal.php">en banc</a> [JURIST report] in the appeal. The order confirmed that the appeal will nonetheless be expedited. The identities of the members of the three-judge panel will not be disclosed until at least 14 days before the arguments. Oral arguments are set to begin on June 8. 

<p>In April, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a <a href="http://aca-litigation.wikispaces.com/file/view/U.S.+brief+as+appellant+(04.01.11).pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] with the Eleventh Circuit, arguing that the PPACA is constitutional. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/doj-files-brief-in-support-of-health-care-reform-law.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that the interstate health market can be regulated by Congress because it is fundamentally different from other markets due to the pervasive government involvement in health care spending. It also argued that the minimum coverage provision, which is the focus of the litigation, is constitutional because it regulates only economic activity, disputing the lower court's finding that failure to purchase health insurance could not be regulated as interstate commerce. In January, Judge Roger Vinson for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the mandate as unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was located and apprehended by the SWC in 2006 and <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/hungary-prosecutors-charge-top-nazi-suspect-with-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in February. Kepiro has denied all charges.

<p>Kepiro's trial is likely one of the last of an accused Nazi. Earlier this week, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-lawyer-calls-for-acquittal-in-closing-arguments.php">defense began closing arguments</a> in the trial of accused Nazi guard <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>]. Demjanjuk's trial, which began in November 2009, has been marked by extensive delay. A verdict is expected this month. In November, Nazi guard <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profile.html?tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=samuel_kunz_936">Samuel Kunz</a> [Trial Watch profile], 89, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/former-nazi-prison-guard-dies-while-awaiting-trial.php">passed away</a> [JURIST report] in his home before he could be brought to trial. He was accused of aiding in the killing of hundreds of thousands of Jewish people at the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ar/belzec.html">Belzec concentration camp</a> [HRP backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The White House's changing factual account of the raid has raised questions about whether the US special operations forces intended to capture Bin Laden alive. Recognizing that the US had intended to arrest Bin Laden, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8bFxStiSM3yJ1MuaOqvU6Le0Vew?docId=CNG.3bce48042eb243fc76055628cd8a2455.6b1">Pillay acknowledged</a> [AFP report] that doing so would have been unlikely under most circumstances. Pillay also indicated that, while the UN condemns terrorism, counter-terrorism activity must be carried out in compliance with international law.

<p>As founder and leader of al Qaeda, Bin Laden represents the highest profile terror target captured or killed by the US. US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] said Wednesday that the killing of Bin Laden by US forces on Sunday was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/holder-bin-laden-killing-lawful.php">lawful and justified</a> [JURIST report]. Testifying before the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website], Holder said that the shooting of Bin Laden was "consistent with our values," and that the soldiers who killed him "conducted themselves totally appropriately." In April, Holder announced that the priorities of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will include <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/doj-to-focus-on-terrorism-financial-fraud-holder.php">protecting Americans from terrorism</a> [JURIST report] at home and abroad, fighting violent crime, combating financial fraud and protecting the most vulnerable members of society.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The international, independent inquiry into the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jun/14/kyrgyzstan-conflict-background">June 2010 ethnic violence</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kyrgyzstan+violence">news archive</a>] that resulted in more than 300 deaths and an additional 2,000 injuries <a href="http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014942998_apaskyrgyzstanethnicviolence.html">discovered</a> [AP report] that security forces participated in the violence that killed hundreds of Uzbeks: <blockquote>The seizure, distribution and use of weapons during the events is a particularly disturbing feature of the events. In many instances crowds of attackers seized firearms and ammunition from the military and police in circumstances largely unopposed by troops or officers. Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) were also surrendered. The KIC notes, with some concern, that some 80 weapons and about 19,000 rounds of ammunition have not been recovered. The authorities of Kyrgyzstan have failed to carry out appropriate criminal and disciplinary investigations into the loss of weapons.</blockquote> The commission also suggested that if the allegations are proven true in a court of law, the conduct may amount to crimes against humanity. Following the announcement by the commission, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called on Kyrgyzstan's authorities to urgently <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/kyrgyzstan-must-deliver-justice-victims-crimes-against-humanity-2011-05-04">investigate and prosecute</a> [press release] those responsible for any human rights violations. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] on Tuesday also <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10984&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the Kyrgyzstan authorities to promptly carry out the report's recommendations to investigate and prosecute participants in the alleged violations.

<p>In November, a court in Kyrgyzstan <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/kyrgyzstan-court-sentences-19-uzbeks-for-murder-and-mass-rioting.php">sentenced 19 ethnic Uzbeks</a> for their involvement in the summer attack. Seventeen of the Uzbeks received life sentences and two received 25-year sentences for their <a href="http://eng.24.kg/investigation/2010/11/24/14950.html">participation in a June 13 riot</a> [24.kg report] that blocked a major highway and killed 16 people in the Suzak district. In September, a Kyrgyz court <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/kyrgyzstan-court-issues-first-convictions-for-ethnic-violence.php">issued the first convictions</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the June 2010 riots, handing down prison terms for eight ethnic Uzbeks in a case stemming from the murder of a Kyrgyz police officer during the violence. Judge Nurgazy Alymkulov of the <a href="http://www.nyulawglobal.org/Globalex/Kyrgyz1.htm">Nooken District Court</a> [GlobaLex backgrounder] <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/In_Kyrgyzstan_Scales_Of_Justice_Appear_Tipped_Following_Interethnic_Violence_/2158139.html">sentenced five to life terms</a> [RFE/RL report] on charges of murder, fomenting ethnic hatred, instigating violence and organizing public unrest. Two others were sentenced to 20 years in prison, and the last was sentenced to nine. Among those given life sentences was prominent Uzbek human rights activist Azimjan Askarov. The convictions were later <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-51515820100915">described as politically motivated</a> [Reuters report]. In July, the Kyrgyz government announced that it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-opens-criminal-cases-following-ethnic-rioting.php">opened more than 1,000 criminal cases</a> [JURIST report] stemming from the violence, and that 106 individuals had been detained, with 97 in custody. Also in July, Kyrgyz <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/kyrgyzstan/7566753/Roza-Otunbayeva-profile-of-Kyrgyzstans-interim-leader.html">President Roza Otunbayeva</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-establishes-commission-to-probe-ethnic-violence.php">established the commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the ethnic violence against the country's Uzbek population. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">called on the King to impose martial law</a> [JURIST report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

For instance it will be particularly important to know if the planning of the mission allowed an effort to capture Bin Laden." The request comes a day after <a href = "http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] also insisted on "a full disclosure of the accurate facts" <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-calls-for-full-disclosure-on-bin-laden-killing.php">surrounding the killing of Bin Laden</a> [JURIST report].

<p>As founder and leader of al Qaeda, Bin Laden represents the highest profile terror target captured or killed by the US.

Through the ruling, gay couples in "stable relationships" now have rights to community property, alimony, health insurance and tax benefits, adoption, and inheritance rights. The court disregarded a portion of the civil code, instead deferring to Article 3, Clause IV of the <a href = "http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constitui%C3%A7ao.htm">Federal Constitution</a> [full text, in Portugese], which provides that the state should "promote the good of everyone, without distinction of origin, race, sex, color, age and other forms of discrimination."

<p>Foreign and domestic courts and legislators are increasingly addressing the issue of gay marriage. Last month, Hungary added a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">prohibition against gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] to its Constitution. France <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/france-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">upheld a same-sex marriage ban</a> [JURIST report] in January.

Though state law requires that parties file suit within two years of discovering an injury, the decision will allow smokers to proceed with claims based on medical conditions originating after a previous diagnosis so long as the injuries are "separate and distinct." Focusing on medical similarities over causation, Justice Joyce Kennard stated:<blockquote>We hold that two physical injuries - both caused by the same tobacco use over the same period of time - can, in some circumstances, be considered "qualitatively different" for purposes of determining when the applicable statute of limitations period begins to run. Specifically, when a later-discovered disease is separate and distinct from an earlier-discovered disease, the earlier disease does not trigger the statute of limitations for a lawsuit based on the later disease.</blockquote>The ruling allows many pending suits to continue, and is expected to generate an influx of new litigation.</p>

<p>Tobacco companies are currently involved in numerous lawsuits. The Illinois Court of Appeals for the Fifth District in February unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/court-rules-101-billion-class-action-against-philip-morris-may-be-reopened.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] to reopen a $10.1 billion class action against <a href="http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Home/default.aspx">Philip Morris</a> [corporate website] for allegedly misleading consumers into thinking that "light" cigarettes were safer and contained less tar. The ruling came in light of a favorable 2008 US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1216.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] that state consumer protection laws can be used to hold cigarette companies liable for the marketing of "light" cigarettes. In December, Philip Morris and <a href="http://www.rjrt.com/">RJ Reynolds</a> [corporate website], along with an industry trade group, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-tobacco-companies-appeal-270-million-settlement-to-supreme-court.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the US Supreme Court to overturn a $271.5 million class action settlement for having "distort[ed] the entire body of public knowledge about the addictive effects of nicotine." The settlement was <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10851376620769925503">awarded</a> [opinion, text] by the <a href="http://www.la4th.org/">Louisiana Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] in order to establish a fund meant to help Louisianans quit smoking. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill limits the window for early voting to one week prior to an election, down from the previously established two weeks, and imposes a series of additional regulations on organizations that enlist new voters, including that they register with the state, submit periodic reports and file voter registration materials within 48 hours of completion. It also requires voters that have moved between any of the state's counties to use provisional ballots if they wish to update their information while at a polling location. Opponents to the legislation charge that its design is <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/05/05/2203413/fla-legislature-oks-elections.html">politically motivated</a> [AP report] to disproportionately affect Democratic constituencies, though its supporters argue that the measures are intended only to reduce election-related expenses and voter fraud. The bill will proceed to <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> [official website] for his signature or veto.

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the state's 2006 Photo ID Act that requires voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. The court ruled that the law "does not deprive any Georgia voter from casting a ballot in any election," and that presenting valid identification does not represent an unconstitutional impediment to voting. In contrast, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October. The court held that the law was inconsistent with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/42usc/subch_ih.php">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA) [materials], which was passed with the intent of increasing voter registration and removing barriers to registration imposed by the states. The NVRA requires voters to attest to the validity of the information on their registration forms, including their citizenship, but does not require them to provide additional proof of citizenship. The law exceeded the federal statute, requiring applicants to show proof before registering to vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The NLRB, an independent US agency that is charged with conducting elections for labor unions and remedying unfair labor practices, argues that <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/const/2/37.htm">Article 2 &#167; 37</a> [text] of Arizona's Constitution acts to limit the means by which employees can choose union representation and conflicts with various sections of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode29/usc_sec_29_00000151----000-.html">National Labor Relations Act</a> (NLRA) [29 USC &#167;&#167; 151-169]. According to the NLRB, the NLRA provides methods in addition to secret ballot elections for private-sector employees to choose a union but contends that the amendment forecloses these options:<blockquote>Under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, private-sector employees have two ways to choose a union: They may vote in a secret-ballot election conducted by the NLRB, or they may persuade an employer to voluntarily recognize a union after showing majority support by signed authorization cards or other means. The state amendments prohibit the second method and therefore interfere with the exercise of a well-established federally-protected right. As the complaint submitted to the Court today explains, "The NLRA permits but does not require secret ballot elections for the designation, selection, or authorization of a collective bargaining representative where, for example, employees successfully petition their employer to voluntarily recognize their designated representative on the basis of reliable evidence of majority support."</blockquote>As a result of this alleged direct conflict with federal law, the NLRB seeks a declaration that the amendment is preempted by the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Preemption">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII background] of the US Constitution. 

<p>The constitutional amendment, passed by state voters in the November 2010 elections, is one of many new state laws that will impact labor unions. In April, Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/wisconsin-ag-sues-judge-calls-for-supreme-court-intervention.php">filed a Petition for Supervisory Writ</a> directly to the state Supreme Court after a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">trial judge temporary blocked</a> [JURIST reports] a controversial bill that limits the rights of public employee unions. The suit claimed that the judge did not have the constitutional authority to block the publication of the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11, PDF]. It also asked the <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] to immediately take jurisdiction of the case and dismiss it. In March, The Ohio <a href="http://www.ohiosenate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ohio-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">passed Senate Bill 5</a> [JURIST report], which altered Ohio labor law and restricts the collective bargaining abilities of unions for public sector workers. Under the legislation, unions can only collectively bargain for wages and equipment for personal safety and that public employees cannot strike.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the report, Gaddafi's troops have employed excessive use of lethal force against unarmed protesters, fired snipers at civilians in residential areas of the city and even deliberately used civilians as "human shields." "Shielding," AI alleged, "is a violation of international humanitarian law and constitutes a war crime." Additionally, according to AI Gaddafi's forces also used <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22cluster%20bomb%22">cluster munitions</a> [JURIST news archive], which are heavily criticized by international observers and have been the subject of international eradication efforts. Misratah appears to be targeted as a result of its declaration in February of allegiance to opposition forces. While many have been able to escape the widespread violence, those left behind continue to suffer:<blockquote>The scale of the relentless attacks that we have seen by al-Gaddafi forces to intimidate the residents of Misratah for more than two months is truly horrifying. It shows a total disregard for the lives of ordinary people and is in clear breach of international humanitarian law. ... Scores of residents not involved in armed confrontations have been killed and hundreds injured, many by indiscriminate 122mm Grad rockets fired from up to tens of kilometres away, and by mortars and 155mm artillery shells. Rockets, mortars and artillery shells are designed for use against massed infantry or armour. Under international humanitarian law, none of these weapons should ever be used in populated residential areas.</blockquote>AI has urged Gaddafi to put an end to direct attacks on civilians and has called on the international community to lend financial and legal support to international investigations into human rights abuses in Libya.

<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-to-request-warrants-for-libya-leaders.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that an investigation has uncovered enough evidence to allow him to pursue warrants for forces loyal to Gaddafi for crimes against humanity and war crimes. Moreno-Ocampo said he has found evidence that Libya began hiring mercenaries as early as January in anticipation of protests after <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Middle+East+revolution">unrest began in the Middle East</a> [JURIST news archive]. Regarding war crimes, the chief prosecutor claims to have uncovered evidence of the use of "cluster munitions, multiple rocket launchers and mortars, and other forms of heavy weaponry, in crowded urban areas, in particular Misratah." Moreno-Ocampo will present his evidence to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Chambers/Pre+Trial+Division/">Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC</a> [official website] and request warrants be issued for three individuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Movement in and out of Daraa came to a halt almost two weeks ago when the Syrian army surrounded the city, cutting electricity, phone lines and internet services as well as supplies such as food and medicine. According to HRW, the siege violates Syria's international obligations under the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [text], which requires the Syrian government to respect "fundamental human rights" and the rule of law. The press release explained:<blockquote>The Syrian government is collectively punishing the residents of Daraa because some demonstrators from the town dared protest against it. It would appear that the government has a lot to hide, because it's refusing to let Daraa residents out or independent observers in. ... Even if the Syrian army is truly 'hunting terrorists,' that is no reason to prevent the town's residents from leaving and to deny old women their medication. Syria has protested repeatedly about Israel's closure of Gaza, but it's doing the same to Daraa's residents.</blockquote>Additionally, HRW cited reports that the Syrian government had been engaged in a "nationwide campaign of [arbitrary] arrests" to deter protesters and activists from continuing the demonstrations. HRW alleged that these arrests also violate international law. 

<p>Syria has struggled violently to end anti-government protests which began earlier this year. Last week, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], in an emergency special session, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">publicly condemned the violence used by Syrian authorities</a> [JURIST report] against peaceful protesters.  Last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for Syria to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also last month, Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended the country's 48-year-old state of emergency</a> [JURIST report], but protests have continued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011 would amend existing federal law passed in 1998 due to changes in the internet and studies demonstrating the increased use of the internet by children. The new legislation would prevent companies from using the information of Internet users under 18 for targeted marketing purposes. The bill would also allow parents to remove the already collected information of their children from the Internet and would create a "Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Teens" to restrict the collection of personal information of minors. Markey <a href="http://markey.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4342&Itemid=141">outlined the need for legislation action</a> [press release]:<blockquote>[K]ids growing up in this online environment ... need protection from the dangers that can lurk in cyberspace. Unfortunately, 'Where the Wild Things Are' can apply to the 21st century Internet and the beloved children's book. That's why to ensure that kids are protected, I am releasing this discussion draft of the 'Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011' so that kids do not have their online behavior tracked or their personal information collected or used without permission</blockquote>The bill is among various proposed legislation that protects privacy online and requires online firms to provide an option for users not to be tracked.

<p>In March, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/obama-administration-supports-internet-privacy-bill-at-senate-hearing.php">backed Internet privacy legislation</a> [JURIST report] at a Senate hearing.

Correa <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/05/08/ecuador-referendum-results.html?ref=rss">claimed victory</a> [CBC report] Saturday night over the results, which he argues are necessary to diffuse power. Opponents have claimed that the measures are aimed at solidifying power and quieting dissent, and have accused Correa of following the authoritarian model of Venezuelan <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chavez">President Hugo Chavez</a> [JURIST news archive]. 

<p>The referendum was first <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-constitutional-court-approves-anti-crime-constitutional-reforms.php">certified</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.ec/">Constitutional Court of Ecuador</a> [official website, in Spanish] in February. In October, the Ecuadorian government announced it would <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ecuador-to-revise-austerity-law-following-unrest.php">revise a controversial austerity law following unrest</a> [JURIST report] and a suspected coup attempt in September. Police officers fired tear gas at Correa, surrounded the hospital at which he was being treated and trapped him there for 12 hours while protesting the public service law, which they feared would reduce their pay and benefits. In September 2008, Ecuadorian voters overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/new-ecuador-constitution-approved-in.php">approved a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] that consolidated and significantly expanded the powers held by Correa, including the power to dissolve the legislature and pass laws by decree.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdullah Khadr is the older brother of <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/commissionsKhadr.html">Omar Khadr</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Omar+Khadr">news archive</a>], the youngest detainee at <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. According to the appeals court, a Toronto judge was right to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/canada-court-orders-release-of-khadr-brother.php">release Abdullah Khadr</a> [JURIST report] last summer because extraditing him to the US would be tantamount to ignoring that he was allegedly subjected to torture in Pakistan at the behest of the US. The court said:<blockquote>The rule of law must prevail even in the face of the dreadful threat of terrorism. We must adhere to our democratic and legal values, even if that adherence serves in the short term to benefit those who oppose and seek to destroy those values. For if we do not, in the longer term, the enemies of democracy and the rule of law will have succeeded. They will have demonstrated that our faith in our legal order is unable to withstand their threats.</blockquote>The Toronto judge noted that Canada is still free to prosecute Abdullah Khadr itself. Additionally, Canada's government has 60 days to appeal Friday's decision.

<p>Abdullah Khadr was detained by Canadian law enforcement in summer 2005 on the basis of a US warrant. In February 2006, the US government <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-seeks-extradition-of-indicted.php">formally requested his extradition</a> [JURIST report] from Canada. He was <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/us-charges-canadian-khadr-brother-with.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2006 by a US federal grand jury on four counts connected to his alleged procurement of destructive devices to be used against US forces in Afghanistan in 2003 and faces a possible life sentence and a USD $1,000,000 fine. Former US Attorney Michael Sullivan said he plans to pursue the extradition "aggressively." Abdullah Khadr admitted to attending an al Qaeda training camp at age 13, but denies the allegations of membership in the group or of supplying weapons to it. Another of Abdullah Khadr's brothers, Abdul Rahman Khadr, was released from Guantanamo in 2003.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The state of emergency was originally scheduled to expire on June 1. According to the <a href="http://byshr.org/">Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights</a> (BYSHR) [advocacy website], the <a href="http://byshr.org/?p=429">trial for activists</a> [BYSHR report] detained during the widespread unrest also started on Sunday. These people face a plethora of charges including terrorism, attempting to violently overthrow the government, insulting the military and participating in unsanctioned rallies. Fourteen of the defendants are in the custody of Bahrani law enforcement, while an additional six remain free. Some commentators allege the early lifting the state of emergency is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/world/middleeast/09bahrain.html">intended to distract observers</a> [NYT report] from the trial of the opposition activists.  

<p>Last week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged the government of Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters. She expressed concern over the prosecution of medical professionals and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">death sentences</a> [JURIST report] handed to four activists last month.

Sanader was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">arrested by Austrian officials</a> [JURIST report] in December on charges of abuse of power, corruption and fraud for taking nearly <a href="http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/General_News/2010-12-10/15781/Sanader_facing_several_charges_of_fraud">&#8364;4 million from public firms and state institutions</a> [<em>Croatian Times</em> report].

Croation president <a href="http://www.predsjednik.hr/PRESIDENT">Ivo Josipovic</a> [official website] said that Sanader would be entitled to a fair trial.

<p>Croatian officials have been under serious pressure to the tackle the issue of corruption in order to gain <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/croatia/index_en.htm">accession</a> [EU materials] to the EU by 2012. On the same day as Sanader was arrested, former interior ministry official Tomislav Mercep was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/top-croatia-official-arrested-for-war-crimes.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of committing war crimes. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE201012081974&lang=e">press release</a>] calling for the prosecution of individuals responsible for war crimes the day before Mercep's arrest. In November, a Croatian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/croatia-court-sentences-6-men-for-2008-death-of-journalist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six men to 15 to 40 years in prison for their roles in the killing of a Croatian journalist in 2008. In 2008, Amnesty International (AI) called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTY">news archive</a>] investigating war crimes in the area.

Australia <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-brings-legal-action-to-end-japan-whaling-practice.php">initiated proceedings</a> [JURIST report] in May 2010, and oral arguments are scheduled to begin in May 2012. Australia contends that Japan is in violation of the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/_documents/commission/convention.pdf">International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling</a> [text, PDF] by not meeting its "good faith" obligation to halt the commercial killing of whales. Japan has <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1686486,00.html">defended the practice as scientific research</a> [TIME report] because they collect data on the whale's age, diet and birthing rate, before packaging and selling the meat. Commercial whaling has been banned by the <a href="http://www.iwcoffice.org/index.htm">International Whaling Commission</a> [official website] since 1986. Japanese <a href="http://www.n-kan.jp/">Prime Minister Naoto Kan</a> [official website, in Japanese] stated that he was <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/japan-pm-naoto-kan-not-concerned-about-australias-whaling-case/story-fn59niix-1226043167900">not concerned</a> [<em>The Australian</em>] about the suit and that it would not affect Japan's relations with Australia.

<p>Japan's whaling practices have sparked international controversy. In July, a Japanese court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/japan-court-convicts-anti-whaling-activist-of-assault-obstruction.php">convicted</a> anti-whaling activist Peter Bethune on charges of assault, trespass, destruction of property, illegal possession of a weapon and obstruction of business for <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/japan-authorities-indict-new-zealand.php">boarding a Japanese whaling vessel</a> [JURIST reports] as part of an anti-whaling protest in January 2010. Berthune, who called the charges "bogus," was extradited to New Zealand, and he will not serve prison time unless he returns to Japan. Last year's annual hunt was ended prematurely due to protests from the anti-whaling group <a href="http://www.seashepherd.org/">Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-110217-1.html">press release</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] and <a href="http://www.azag.gov/bio.html">Attorney General Tom Horne</a> [official profile] <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_050911_BrewerPetitionUSSupremeCourtSB1070.pdf">announced</a> [press release] that the state would immediately petition the Supreme Court to lift the injunction. Brewer said she knew the fight over SB 1070 would be a prolonged legal battle, but the state is taking it directly to the nation's highest court after unsuccessful attempts to have the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] lift the injunction. Arizona argues that it is on the front lines of a fight against cartel-led crime entering the US from the border with Mexico and that states have a right to pass laws to protect themselves. The announcement comes less than a month after a Ninth Circuit panel <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php?amp">refused to lift the injunction</a> [JURIST report] on parts of the immigration law, including a requirement that police officers enforcing other laws question people about their immigration status if the officers have reason to suspect they are an illegal immigrant. Arizona is also <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/arizona-governor-countersues-us-government-over-immigration-law.php">countersuing the federal government</a> [JURIST report] for failing to adequately protect the US border with Mexico. The outcome over Arizona's immigration law will have serious implications on states' rights and immigration reform as similar bills are being considered ans passed by other state legislatures, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports]. 

<p>Last July, the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-enjoins-sections-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">granted a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] blocking implementation of the law. In affirming that decision, the Ninth Circuit held that "the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the United States demonstrated that it faced irreparable harm and that granting the preliminary injunction properly balanced the equities and was in the public interest." In addressing the equities and public interest, the Ninth Circuit indicated that the constitutional infringement of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text] alleged by the DOJ could itself constitute irreparable harm to the federal government absent injunctive relief. The DOJ had <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] Arizona and Brewer last year, arguing that both the Constitution and federal law "do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country." The agency also claimed that the federal government has preeminent authority to regulate immigration matters and that the enforcement of the Arizona law is counterproductive to the national immigration policy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Oklahoma voters <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">overwhelmingly approved the measure</a> [JURIST report], <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/questions/755.pdf?5,5">State Question 755</a> (SQ 755) [text, PDF], last November with 70 percent of the vote. The ACLU and CAIR filed suit on behalf of Oklahoma citizen Muneer Awad, who argued that the ban would invalidate part of his will, which is partially rooted in Islamic Sharia Law, and a judge for the <a href="http://www.okwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-oklahoma-amendment-banning-use-of-islamic-l.php">issued a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report]. The groups argued that the amendment should be permanently enjoined:<blockquote>As the District Court concluded after an evidentiary hearing, the proposed constitutional amendment has harmful, real-world consequences. The measure tramples the free exercise rights of a disfavored minority faith and constrains the ability of Plaintiff Muneer Awad and his fellow Muslims in Oklahoma to execute valid wills, assert religious liberty claims under the Oklahoma Religious Freedom Act, and enjoy equal access to the state judicial system.

<p>The "Save Our State Amendment" also undercuts a central tenet of the Establishment Clause, sending an unmistakable message that Muslims are religious and political outsiders in their own State. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in preliminarily enjoining this unprecedented measure.</blockquote>It remains unclear exactly what effect the measure would have since foreign law is not binding on state or federal courts.</p>

<p>SQ 755 would prevent Oklahoma courts from "look[ing] to the legal precepts of other nations or cultures," requiring them only to look to legal precedents of other states for guidance, provided that state does not use Islamic law. It was sponsored by state <a href="http://www.okhouse.gov/committees/member.aspx?memberid=54">Representative Rex Duncan</a> (R) [official website], who described it as a preemptive strike against the use of Islamic law in Oklahoma. Duncan defended SQ 755 as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybvivrs_MH0">necessary to protect Oklahoma</a> [MSNBC video] from an attack on the fundamental Judeo-Christian principles on which he says the US is founded. Several other state legislatures are now considering similar measures.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Garranah was found to have sold public land in the Red Sea province below market value to two businessmen. The two businessmen were also found guilty <em>in absentia</em> and also received five-year sentences. The court said that Garranah had <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE7491M220110510?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">illegally allocated the public land</a> to the private developers. He is the second high-ranking state official to be found guilty of corruption since former Egyptian president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>] was forced from office in February. More convictions are likely since there are close to two dozen former Mubarak cabinet members and other business people who have been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ge_JLzJBIw_C2V9tlZI41VnXhcfA?docId=b67dcaac57334136ba034178abb3e450">detained</a> [AP report] for alleged corruption thus far, including the former prime minister, the speakers of parliament's two chambers, and Mubarak's two sons.  

<p>Prosecutors said last month that Mubarak could <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">face the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] if convicted of ordering attacks on protesters during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive] early this year. Mubarak is also facing charges of corruption and embezzlement of public funds. His detention, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-prosecutor-extends-mubarak-detention.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] last month to give authorities more time to decide if they want to send him to jail or a prison hospital, was extended again Tuesday. He is being detained at Sharm el-Sheikh International Hospital after he was hospitalized for heart trouble. Also last month, an Egyptian court ordered that Mubarak's <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/egypt-court-dissolves-mubaraks-national-democratic-party.php">political party be dissolved</a> [JURIST report]. The country's High Administrative Court said It would be illogical for Mubarak's National Democratic Party, which took control in 1978, to remain an entity. The court also liquidated the party's assets. Analysts call the court's decision an important step in the building of a multi-party system, which the country has not had for more than 30 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced that al-Nashiri would be tried in a military court and would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/accused-uss-cole-bomber-to-be-tried-in-military-court.php">subject to capital charges</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website] is asking the ECHR to intervene and direct Poland to "use all available means at its disposal to ensure that the United States does not subject him to the death penalty," arguing that Poland violated the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The OSJI has also asked the court to direct Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland to intervene.

<p>In March, Polish prosecutors investigating the alleged secret CIA prison announced that they were asking US officials to question al-Nashiri and a second <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Guantanamo+Bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee who claims he was held and abused at the site. The OSJI, which helped to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">launch the abuse investigation</a> [JURIST report] last September, urged the US to provide assistance. The investigation into al-Nashiri's allegations of the secret prison's existence and his abuse there began soon after former Polish prime minister Leszek Miller <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-ex-pm-denies-knowledge-of-cia-secret-prison.php">denied any knowledge of a secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST report] in Poland. His denial followed confirmation by a former CIA agent that the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,717166,00.html">agency tortured</a> [Spiegel report] al-Nashiri in 2002 at a secret prison located in Poland. According to the agent, al-Nashiri was stripped naked and hooded before a gun and a drill were held close to his head. Former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski has also denied the existence of the prisons. Both he and Miller maintain that they will not discuss the allegations of torture until the completion of an investigation into Poland's role in the US prisoner <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program. The original investigation into the existence of the CIA-operated prison was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php">launched by the Polish government</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sebelius</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://healthcarelawsuits.org/detail.php?c=2171285&t=Commonwealth-of-Virginia-v.-Sebelius">materials</a>] was filed by the state's attorney general <a href="http://www.vaag.com/index.html">Kenneth Cuccinelli</a> [official website] in March 2010 and challenges the law on the basis that Congress' use of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Commerce Clause</a> [text] to compel citizens of Virginia to purchase health insurance is an extension of its power and breach of federalism principles. A judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/12/13/va.healthcare.ruling.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] in December that the minimum coverage provision of the law is unconstitutional and that an individual's decision to purchase health insurance is beyond the reach of Congress and outside the purview of the Commerce, Necessary and Proper, General Welfare and Taxation powers enumerated in the US Constitution. <a href="http://healthcarelawsuits.net/pdf/LibertyvGeithner.pdf">Liberty University v. Geithner</a> [complaint; PDF; <a href="http://healthcarelawsuits.org/detail.php?c=2276166&t=Liberty-University%2C-Inc.-et-al-v.-Geithner-et-al">materials</a>] also challenged the statute as a violation of the Commerce Clause. A judge for the <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.vawd.uscourts.gov/OPINIONS/MOON/LIBERTYUNIVERSITYVGEITHNER.PDF">dismissed the suit</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>] in November finding that the individual mandate was within Congressional authority and that the plaintiffs had failed to state a claim. During the arguments, lawyers for <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website] maintained that the individual mandate was regulating an inactivity, which is beyond Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause, stating that, "commerce has never been extended to regulate simply idleness" and that choosing to avoid an economic transaction is not commerce. Liberty University also rejected the contention that the law falls within Congress's authority under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/necessary_and_proper_clause">Necessary and Proper Clause</a> [text]. A lawyer for the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] argued that Congress made specific findings regarding individual financial decisions regarding health care and that lack of participation in the health insurance market does not equate lack of participation in the health care market. The DOJ stated that active participation in the health care market is "a virtually universal feature of human existence" regardless of the intent to use health care. The DOJ also argued that Virginia lacks standing to challenge the individual mandate because the state can not show how they are harmed by the provision, and that the state's role as <em>parens patriae</em> is not valid in this situation. The DOJ argued that such a role would interject the states into "abstract political disputes" that are "best handled outside federal courtrooms."  Lawyers for Virginia countered the DOJ argument regarding the state's standing stating that because the federal government is one of enumerated powers there must be a forum to address the limits of those powers and that "if the federal courts are not the forum, then there's no forum." 

<p>In April, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-rejects-virginias-petition-for-expedited-review-of-health-care-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Virginia's request for the court to rule on the constitutionality of the health care reform law on an expedited basis. The writ was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/virginia-ag-petitions-supreme-court-for-expedited-health-care-ruling.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] in February by Cuccinelli, who sought to have the high court depart from its traditional procedure and instead review the constitutionality of the law before the Fourth Circuit ruled on the issue. Additional challenges to the law continue to proceed through the lower courts. In April, a judge for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-healthcare-reform-act.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. Judge Freda Wolfson dismissed the lawsuit, brought without an attorney by two New Jersey residents, on jurisdictional grounds, ruling the two men had no <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing">standing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to challenge the law. In a similar ruling earlier in April, a judge for the <a href="http://www.nhd.uscourts.gov/default.asp">US District Court for the District of New Hampshire</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] also challenging the law's constitutionality and held that the plaintiff, 80-year-old Harold Peterson, lacked standing because his Medicare coverage automatically satisfied the law's insurance mandate. A judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down the law</a> in January, while in October, a judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report]. US Courts of Appeal for the Third, Sixth and Eleventh circuits are all currently scheduled to hear oral arguments in appeals of lower court rulings, while appeals are pending in the DC circuit as well as the Eighth and Ninth circuits. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tandja has been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/nigers-ex-president-is-released-from-house-arrest/2011/05/10/AF172VjG_story.html">in custody for 14 months</a> [AP report] following a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-president-held-hostage-in.php">military coup</a> [JURIST report] in February 2010. The military junta <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7490CM20110510">charged Tandja with corruption</a> [Reuters report] following his removal, based on a junta investigation that found USD $128 million was stolen during Tandja's 10-year presidency. The appeals court ruled that it was impossible to try a head of state after leaving office. The prosecution has not reacted to Tandja's release.

<p>In November, voters in Niger have overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/niger-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">approved a new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD) <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-military-leaders-suspend.php">suspended</a> the <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/niger-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">previous constitution</a> [JURIST reports], which allowed Tandja to remain in office for three more years and to run in any subsequent elections. The constitution is Niger's seventh since independence from France in 1960. In September 2009, members of Nigerien opposition parties said that police had detained 30 former opposition lawmakers allegedly at the behest of Tandja. The 30 former members of parliament were arrested on <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/niger-opposition-lawmakers-arrested-for.php">charges of embezzlement</a> [JURIST report], but were likely being targeted for their dissidence, as they refused to recognize Tandja's expansion of powers. In February of last year, Nigerien rights group, the United Front for the Safeguard of Democratic Assets (Fusad), <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/niger-rights-group-urges-prosecution-of.php">pushed for the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of Tandja on treason charges and corruption violating the constitution shortly after the coup.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Troy "Tariq" Montgomery wears a tight-fitting cap called a kufi&#8212;a traditional Muslim symbol of humility. Henry County State Court Judge James Chafin originally requested Montgomery <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/henry/judge-will-allow-muslim-940717.html">show proof that wearing the kufi is required</a> [AJC report]. The Judicial Council of Georgia decided to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/georgia-judge-reverses-decision-that-blocked-man-from-court-because-of-muslim-headwear/2011/05/09/AFNdPXbG_story.html">allow headwear for religious or medical reasons</a> [AP report] in July 2009 following a similar dispute in December 2008 when a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/georgia-court-jails-muslim-woman-for.php">Muslim woman was arrested</a> [JURIST report] after <a href="http://www.times-georgian.com/view/full_story/13169075/article-Religious-headwear-dispute-mirrors-local-case?instance=west_ga_news">refusing to remove her headscarf in court</a> [<em>Times Georgian</em> report].  Montgomery, who is contesting a speeding ticket, indicated he was surprised by the reversal and hopes no one else has to defend wearing Islamic attire in court.

<p>The wearing of traditional religious clothing in court rooms and other public places has been highly contested in the US and around the world. In March, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to review a lower court order <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/canada-supreme-court-to-review-ban-on-muslim-veil-during-testimony.php">requiring a Muslim woman to remove her niqab</a> [JURIST report] while testifying. The Court of Appeal for Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ontario-high-court-allows-witnesses-to-wear-niqab-unless-unfair-to-accused.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a witness does not have to remove her veil unless the failure to do so will prevent the accused from receiving a fair trial, and should be determined on a case-by-case basis. In December, the <a href="http://www.acluga.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia</a> (ACLUGA) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/georgia-woman-arrested-for-wearing-headscarf-in-court-files-lawsuit.php">filed a lawsuit on behalf of a Muslim woman</a> [JURIST report] who was arrested for refusing to remove her headscarf in court. In October, the French Constitutional Council <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a bill making it illegal to wear the Islamic burqa, niqab or other full face veils in public, conforms with the Constitution. Earlier that month, a Dutch politician suggested that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition. Last May, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ninth-circuit-rules-removing-headscarf.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a Muslim woman's religious rights were not violated by police officers when she was forced to remove her headscarf while being detained in a holding cell. In April 2010, a judge for the US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-dismisses-suit-over-order.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against a Michigan judge who ordered a Muslim woman to remove her headscarf in court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Clark Waddoups <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/cougars/51788264-78/law-utah-arizona-immigration.html.csp">issued a temporary restraining order</a> [<em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> report] at the request of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] and other plaintiffs that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">challenged the law</a> [JURIST report] last week. The bill, which has been compared to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&amp;image.x=0&amp;image.y=0">Arizona immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] in March by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] and requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. The lawsuit claims that the law unconstitutionally interferes with federal powers over immigration enforcement and violates the Fourth Amendment search and seizure provision and the Equal Protection clause of the US Constitution. A hearing for a preliminary injunction was scheduled for July 14. 

<p>Several other state legislatures have also acted recently to implement so-called "Arizona style" immigration laws. Last month, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] to revoke tax credits from businesses that hire illegal immigrants and require the use of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-verify System</a> [official website] to check the eligibility status of employees. Also in April, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx">Georgia General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved a bill</a> requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone they have probable cause to believe has committed a criminal offense and requiring businesses to use E-Verify to check the immigration status of potential employees. Similar legislation has also been approved in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports].

The jury in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] found that Rajaratnam orchestrated the largest hedge fund insider trading case in US history, finding him guilty of five counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and nine counts of securities fraud. US Attorney Preet Bharara said:<blockquote>The message today is clear&#8212;there are rules and there are laws, and they apply to everyone, no matter who you are or how much money you have. Unlawful insider trading should be offensive to everyone who believes in, and relies on, the market. It cheats the ordinary investor, victimizes the companies whose information is stolen, and is an affront not only to the fairness of the market, but the rule of law. In just over 18 months, this office has charged 47 individuals with insider trading crimes; Rajaratnam is the 35th person to be convicted. We will continue to pursue and prosecute those who believe they are both above the law and too smart to get caught.</blockquote>Rajaratnam faces a maximum sentence of 205 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for July 29. His lawyer <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-11/rajaratnam-is-found-guilty-of-all-counts-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial.html">plans to appeal</a> [Bloomberg report].

<p>Several other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. Danielle Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January. Former <a href="http://www.ibm.com/us/en/">IBM</a> [corporate website] senior vice president Robert Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> in September and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former <a href="http://www.intel.com/about/companyinfo/capital/index.htm">Intel Capital</a> [corporate website] executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/former-intel-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain.

Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and UN Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] issued a statement after the proposed relief mission to Deraa, the city where protests have been most extensive, failed to move forward on Sunday despite repeated entreaties to Syrian authorities for access. "The main objective of the mission was to independently assess the situation and plan a response if needed," Amos reported in her statement, but even a direct phone call from UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] to Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile]  last week regarding the proposed assessment  proved unavailing. Citing reports of Syrian tank deployment and shelling of residential areas, the humanitarian relief chief said she was worried that security operations in the cities could be preventing supplies of basic social services, especially hospital access for the many wounded civilians. Amos admitted she had no confirmation of the numbers, but Syrian human rights groups claim that hundreds of civilians have been killed and thousands more have been arrested or wounded.

<p>Syria has struggled violently to end anti-government protests which began earlier this year. At the end of April the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], in an emergency special session, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">publicly condemned the violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. Also last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for Syria to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Assad has recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended the 48-year-old state of emergency</a> [JURIST report], an event of significant historical note, but protests have continued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court affirmed Bhagwan Dass's conviction on the charges of killing his daughter who had walked out of her marriage and began an affair with her cousin. The ruling by Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Misra advocated classifying honor killings as crimes that come within "the rarest of rare cases deserving death punishment." The court characterized the practice as barbaric and feudal and a slur on the nation. The court advocated for the death penalty as a deterrent and advised that the "gallows" await for those who plan on committing honor killings. 

<p>Although lower courts have given death sentences in honor killing cases, the Supreme Court had yet to weigh in on death penalties for honor killings. In April, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/india-high-court-urges-end-to-practice-of-honor-killing.php">urged an end to honor killings</a> [JURIST report] and called the custom wholly illegal.

A Bahraini military court was set to try 14 prominent government opposition activists Thursday, along with several more activists who are in hiding or exile and will be tried <em>in absentia</em>. Among the charges leveled against them are that they set up "terror groups to topple the royal regime and change the constitution," insulted the army, incited hatred, disseminated false information and illegally took part in rallies without notifying the authorities, according to state-run <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en">Bahrain News Agency</a> (BNA) [official website]. Amnesty International has <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=19449">publicly stated</a> [press release] that it "believes many of the defendants are likely to be prisoners of conscience, detained simply for exercising their right to peacefully express their political views in public." Subsequent to their arrests, at least two of the defendants were <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE74A28E20110511?sp=true">reportedly maltreated</a> [Reuters report] during their incommunicado detainment, including prominent human rights defender Abdelhadi al-Khawaja, who at a court appearance this week bore visible signs of ill-treatment and perhaps torture, according to HRW. The New York-based rights group said that they could see a number of injuries to al-Khawaja's face, and that he told them he had been beaten and suffered four facial fractures, including one to his jaw that reportedly required four hours of surgery and a six-day stay at the Bahrain Defence Force hospital. BNA has denied the reports as fabricated and politically-motivated. Meanwhile, HRW has asked that Bahraini authorities allow all defendants full access to lawyers, family members and necessary medical care. HRW also noted that Bahrain is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which prohibits torture, and that the country has ratified the Convention Against Torture.

<p>Six of the opposition <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] in March after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in the capital of Manana. Many protesters are calling for the removal of the royal family, which has been in power since the 18th century. Last week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged the government of Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters. She expressed concern over the prosecution of medical professionals and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">death sentences</a> [JURIST report] handed to four activists last month. In April, human rights organizations including HRW and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized Bahrain</a> [JURIST report] for rampant human rights abuses related to anti-government protests. This week Bahraini <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-king-lifts-state-of-emergency.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the three-month <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">put in place</a> [JURIST report] in mid-March in response to growing unrest, will be lifted two weeks early.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court upheld counts for federal funds bribery, depriving others of honest services, Scrushy's bribery of Siegelman and obstruction of justice. However, the court reversed counts based on the allegation that Scrushy used his seat on Alabama's Certificate of Need Review Board to attempt to affect the interests of HealthSouth and its competitors and that this self-dealing was a part of the larger scheme that Siegelman and Scrushy had orchestrated. The court agreed with Siegelman that there was no evidence at trial to link him to Scrushy's self-dealing scheme. The court also did not agree with the Government's post-Skilling theory of Scrushy's alleged bribery of another Health South employee:<blockquote>The government's case, even in Counts 8 and 9, was always primarily focused on the pay-to-play scheme between Scrushy and Siegelman. The vast majority of the allegations and testimony went to prove this scheme. The government always described the scheme alleged in Counts 8 and 9 as selfdealing, and its attempt now&#8212;post-Skilling&#8212;to emphasize the alleged bribery of Adams finds some, but not much, support in the proof. The evidence that Adams intended to alter his official actions as a result of the receipt of benefits from Scrushy is insufficient, and Scrushy's convictions on Counts 8 and 9 must be reversed.</blockquote>Scrushy said that he was <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2011/05/11/ex-healthsouth-ceo-scrushy-confident-supreme-court-reverse-charges/">pleased</a> [FoxBusiness report] with the reversal of the bribery counts and that he plans to appeal to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to have the rest of the charges overturned. 

<p>Last June, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-soft-money-ban.php">vacated the 2006 judgments</a> [JURIST report] against Siegelman and Scrushy. Their cases were remanded to the Eleventh Circuit for proceedings consistent with the court's ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1394.pdf">Skilling v. United States</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-holds-publicity-did-not-prevent-fair-trial-in-enron-case.php">report</a>]. Siegelman and Scrushy were <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/former-alabama-governor-ex-healthsouth.php">convicted in 2006</a> [JURIST report] on federal bribery and corruption charges. The convictions were appealed, and Siegelman had two counts of mail fraud reversed for lack of evidence. The court of appeals later <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/eleventh-circuit-denies-alabama-ex.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] by Siegelman and Scrushy for an <em>en banc</em> rehearing of their convictions on charges of corruption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge found that Demjanjuk, 91, served as a guard at the at the Sobidor death camp, assisting in the deaths of nearly 28,000 Jews. The five-year sentence is less than the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-prosecutor-requests-6-year-sentence-for-alleged-nazi-guard.php">six years sought by the prosecution</a> [JURIST report]. Judge Ralph Alt <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15068941,00.html">ordered his release</a> [DW report] because of his advanced age and because the verdict is not final. Appeals could take another year or more. This is likely to be one of the world's last Nazi war crimes trials.

<p>Demjanjuk's trial, which <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009, was marked by extensive delay. Last May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss the charges</a> [JURIST report] filed by the defense, which argued there was a lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the argument, saying they found the evidence against Demjanjuk to be strong. In October 2009, Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a> after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/germany-court-blocks-stay-of.php">rejected appeals relating to his health</a> [JURIST reports], although the court limited hearings to no more than two 90-minute sessions per day. Demjanjuk fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. He was deported to Germany after the US <a thref="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">denied his stay of deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group <a href="https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1785485&Site=DC&ShowBanner=no&Target=_self&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE">announced</a> [press release] that the "new landmark treaty of the Council of Europe opens the path for creating a legal framework at pan-European level to protect women against all forms of violence, and prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence." In response to a statistic that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13362440">at least 15 percent of women</a> [BBC article] have been victims of domestic violence, the treaty targets crimes including  rape, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, sexual harassment, forced abortion and forced sterilization. The treaty also recognizes:<blockquote>the realization of de jure and de facto equality between women and men is a key element in the prevention of violence against women; ... that violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between women and men, which have led to domination over, and discrimination against, women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women; ... the structural nature of violence against women as gender-based violence, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men; ... ongoing human rights violations during armed conflicts that affect the civilian population, especially women in the form of widespread or systematic rape and sexual violence and the potential for increased gender-based violence both during and after conflicts; ... that women and girls are exposed to a higher risk of gender-based violence than men; ... that domestic violence affects women disproportionately, and that men may also be victims of domestic violence; [and] ... that children are victims of domestic violence, including as witnesses of violence in the family.</blockquote>Thirteen countries signed the treaty during the 121st session held in Istanbul, including France, Germany and Spain.  

<p>Domestic violence continues to be a global problem. A 2010 Human Rights Watch report <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uae-domestic-violence-ruling-a-violation-of-treaty-obligations-hrw.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a United Arabic Emirates practice of a "husband['s] right to discipline his wife." The report noted that women in these countries still face many obstacles in achieving equality, and, despite the progress, women in the region still have little recourse for domestic violence and face discrimination in employment, education and politics. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/europe-court-rules-turkish-government.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Turkish government is responsible for the death of a woman at the hands of her ex-husband because it failed to investigate complaints. A few months earlier, the <a href="http://wcd.nic.in/">India Ministry of Women and Child Development</a> (WCD) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/india-government-to-review-anti-dowry.php">review</a> [JURIST report] the country's controversial <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/3259965.stm">anti-dowry act</a> [BBC backgrounder] because increasing numbers of Indian women had issued complaints about misuse. Despite legislation controlling the cultural and religious practice, India's dowry system continues illegally, leaving many women subject to abuse without enforcement of legal protections from so-called "dowry deaths". In 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pakistan-lower-house-passes-bill.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST report] instituted the <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/private_bills/prevention_domestic_violence_12082008.pdf">Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, 2008</a> [text, PDF], moving a step closer to outlawing domestic violence in the country by protecting women, children and domestic employees from mental, physical, and sexual abuse. In 2006, the COE released a report <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/france-justice-minister-claims.php">criticizing</a> [JURIST report] France's human rights record and identifying impunity for domestic violence as a shortcoming in the French judicial system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/2635.htm">Governor Mitch Daniels</a> [official profile] signed the bill into law Tuesday in order to save $3 million in public funds used for services such as birth control, cancer screening and tests for sexually transmitted diseases. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], together with PPIN, sought to maintain state funding while they pursued a suit challenging the law, but Judge Tanya Walton Pratt <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/11/planned-parenthood-indiana_n_860618.html">denied</a> [AP report] their request. PPIN President and CEO Betty Cockrum <a href="http://www.ppin.org/News_TRORuling.html">criticized the ruling</a> [press release]:<blockquote>We are deeply disappointed that the judge decided not to stop this unconscionable law from impacting Hoosiers seeking preventive, reproductive health care. ... The ruling means that Hoosiers who rely on federal funding have lost access to their crucial and lifesaving preventive health care at Planned Parenthood of Indiana. ... [We] will continue to fight on behalf of thousands of patients at our 28 health centers around the state who count on PPIN for health care.</blockquote>Ken Falk, Legal Director for the ACLU of Indiana, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-challenge-indiana-law-would-end-federal-funding-fam">said</a> [press release], "[f]amily planning dollars fund preventive health services that are critical to low-income and vulnerable women and their families... It is unlawful, unnecessary and cruel to deny these populations health services that they desperately need." 

<p>Tuesday's bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] last month by the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] banning abortions performed after 20 weeks of pregnancy, citing the possibility that after that point the fetus may be able to feel pain. Under <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/bills/2011/PDF/EH/EH1210.2.pdf">HB 1210</a> [text, PDF], a physician must "[d]etermine in accordance with accepted medical standards the post-fertilization age of the fetus and which trimester the pregnant woman receiving the abortion is in [and] determine whether the fetus is viable" prior to performing an abortion. If the fetus is determined to be beyond the 20 week fertilization period, the abortion is banned. The bill makes the performance of an abortion beyond 20 weeks a criminal act with the limited exception of a procedure deemed necessary to save the life of the mother. The House also <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=46206&SessionIndex=-1&SessionId=66&BillText=abortion%20ultrasound&BillNumber=&BillSponsorIndex=0&BillListIndex=0&BillStatuteText=&BillTypeIndex=0&BillReferredIndex=0&HouseChamber=H&BillSearchIndex=0">passed legislation</a> [HB 1127 materials] mandating that an ultrasound be performed, and that the resulting image be viewed by the pregnant woman, before she can seek an abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the legislation, individuals entering into a civil union "shall enjoy all the same rights, benefits, protections, and shall be subject to all the same responsibilities, as married persons under Delaware law." The bill also provides that "the rights of parties to a civil union, with respect to a child of whom either party becomes the parent during the term of the civil union, shall be the same as the rights (including presumptions of parentage) of married spouses." The <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/legislature.nsf/Lookup/SenateHome?open&nav=senate">Delaware Senate</a> voted 13-6 to pass the bill in April, and the <a href="http://legis.delaware.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 26-15 the following week in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/delaware-house-passes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">favor of the bill</a> [JURIST report]. The law takes effect on January 1, 2012. Delaware is the eighth state to allow civil unions for same-sex couples.

<p>Issues surrounding same-sex civil unions and marriages continue to be debated throughout the US. In April, Washington <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/">Governor Chris Gregoire</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/washington-governor-signs-bill-recognizing-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] recognizing out-of-state <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive] as legal domestic partnerships. House Bill 1649 amends the current law, which acknowledges out-of-state domestic partnerships and civil unions, but excludes same-sex marriage. The Senate approved the bill by a 28-19 vote after the House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/washington-approves-bill-recognizing-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] by a similar margin. The bill will become effective 90 days after the close of the current legislative session. Also in April, the <a href="http://courts.state.ar.us/opinions/sc_opinions_list.cfm">Arkansas Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/arkansas-high-court-upholds-decision-to-strike-gay-adoption-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision invalidating a state ban on adoptions by same-sex couples. The court affirmed the decision of the Pulaski County Circuit Court invalidating <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/cole-v-arkansas-case-profile">Act 1</a> [ACLU backgrounder], a state law which prohibits all unmarried couples from adopting or fostering children in the state. The original suit was filed after the law was criticized for effectively denying all gay couples the right to adopt or foster a child because Arkansas does not recognize gay marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The committee approved a revision to the <a href="http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/ndaa-home?p=ndaa">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012</a> [materials] that would require the heads of all four military branches to certify that lifting the ban on gays in the military would not harm military operations. Currently, the repeal must only be certified by the secretary of defense and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with full repeal to take place within 60 days of certification. The amendment was introduced by <a href="http://hunter.house.gov/index.php">Rep. Duncan Hunter</a> (R-CA) [official website], who <a href="http://hunter.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=364&Itemid=60">said</a> [press release] that "excluding the service chiefs is a mistake."

<p>US President Barack Obama <a href="=/paperchase/2010/12/obama-signs-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal.php">signed the bill to repeal DADT</a> [JURIST report] in December, but the process could still take months.

The measure was approved by a vote of 38 - 27, with only one Democrat joining Republicans in supporting the amendment. Minnesota law currently defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman, but proponents say that a constitutional amendment is necessary to protect against same-sex marriage being legalized by a court. The measure must now be approved by the <a href="http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/">House of Representatives</a> [official website], where it is expected to pass. If approved, it will go before voters in November 2012. 

<p>Same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial and divisive issue through the US, although a recent <a href="http://people-press.org/2011/03/03/fewer-are-angry-at-government-but-discontent-remains-high/">poll</a> [materials] suggests support for legalization is growing. Last month, a Montana judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that had called for the state to provide legal status to same-sex relationships.

A list of the exclusive licenses to be repealed will appear in the Official Journal within three months if the bill becomes law. The bill was passed on a first reading. It must now be approved by the Senate. 

<p>Hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, has become a controversial issue as it is implemented in the US and around the world. Hydraulic fracturing is a process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the ground to create fractures in rocks which allows trapped gas and oil to come to surface. Environmental and health concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing include contamination of ground water, migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface and the potential mishandling of waste.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, Zardari also serves as a co-chairman for the <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> (PPP) [party website]. The decision to remove Zardari from head of political party is in response to petitions challenging Zardari's <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/pakistan-court-challenges-presidents-dual-offices.php">ability to effectively serve in two roles</a> [JURIST report]. Those in opposition to Zardari also claimed that Zardari was violating Pakistan's <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">constitution</a> [text] by serving in the capacity of president and party head simultaneously. The court rejected the argument that Zardari enjoyed presidential immunity from judicial intervention under the constitution. The LHC verdict, in support of  the claim that the president should be a symbol of impartiality, ordered that Zardari disassociate himself from all political activities immediately.

<p>Since becoming president in 2008, Zardari has faced several challenges. Last year, Zardari <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pakistan-amendment-curbing-presidential.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/govt_bills/govt_bill2010/constitution_eighteenth_amendment_act2010_060410.pdf">18th Amendment bill</a> [text, PDF], limiting presidential powers expanded under Pervez Musharraf. Under the amendment, which effectively reduces the role of the president to a figurehead, the vast majority of the president's powers will be transferred to the office of the prime minister. The introduction of the bill came amid controversy over reopening corruption investigations against Zardari. Weeks earlier, Pakistan's attorney general Anwar Mansoor <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/pakistan-ag-resigns-amid-corruption.php">announced his resignation</a> over controversy surrounding a Supreme Court order to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">investigate corruption allegations</a> [JURIST reports]. Swiss authorities denied a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-officials-urge-switzerland-to.php">request</a> [JURIST report] from Pakistan's <a href="http://www.nab.gov.pk/">National Accountability Bureau</a> [official website], refusing to reopen a corruption investigation against Zardari. Aides to Zardari believed that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution, even after the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">overturned an amnesty law</a> [JURIST report] implemented by Musharraf.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that fatwas can <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=185458">only be issued by appropriately educated persons</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report] and that no one can be forced to accept a fatwa. The court had declared fatwas illegal in 2001, but, in 2010, the court ruled that a person cannot be punished for issuing a fatwa. Thursday's ruling was <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=185463">welcomed</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report] by scholars and rights activists, but groups urged caution against the impact of the fatwa being declared legal. Clerics have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13379016">criticized the ruling</a> [BBC report].

<p>Bangladesh, whose population is over 90 percent Muslim, has nonetheless maintained a secular legal system. In August, the Supreme Court ruled that workplaces and schools <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bangladesh-court-rules-against-mandatory-religious-clothing.php">cannot force individuals to wear religious clothing</a> [JURIST report] such as veils and skull caps. The court found that wearing religious clothing is an individual choice and cannot be made mandatory, and requiring individuals to wear religious clothing is a human rights violation in contravention of the <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.bd/pmolib/constitution/">Bangladeshi Constitution</a> [text]. In July, the Supreme Court overturned a constitutional amendment that had  <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bangladesh-high-court-outlaws-religious-parties.php">allowed religious parties to participate in politics</a> [JURIST report]. The court, upholding a lower court decision, held that the Fifth Amendment to the Bangladeshi Constitution, which allowed the participation of religious political parties and legitimized military rule, violated the principle of secularism and representative democracy found in the constitution's preamble.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Speaking on the floor of the US <a href="http://senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website], McCain said that the name of Bin Laden's courier was not obtained from accused 9/11 conspirator <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>], contradicting reports from several current and former US officials:

<p>In an <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=e4435e90-0b67-18f3-7c23-e75d72410396">op-ed</a> published Thursday in the <em>Washington Post</em>, McCain argued that certain enhanced interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, constitute torture and that he opposes such techniques, saying, "abuse of prisoners sometimes produces good intelligence but often produces bad intelligence."</p>

<p>Bin Laden was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month in Pakistan by a small team of US military personnel.

The notice also served as a reminder to Djibouti that, as a state party to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], it had an obligation to cooperate with warrants for arrests issued by the ICC for the Sudanese president. Al-Bashir faces <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> as well as <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">three charges of genocide</a> [JURIST reports] in relation to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The ICC rests its authority on enforcing Djibouti's obligation on prior decisions it has made regarding al-Bashir's arrest. The ICC reminded the states parties that pursuant to the warrants of arrests issued in March 2009 and July 2010 against al-Bashir, "the ICC Registrar had issued and transmitted requests for arrest and surrender of Mr. Al Bashir to all States Parties to the Rome Statute, including Djibouti." In addition to informing the council, the ICC has left room for the ICC and state party members to use any appropriate measures to effectuate the arrest of al-Bashir. 

<p>Other countries have also been reported for failing to arrest al-Bashir while he has been present inside their borders. In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">ICC requested that  Kenya arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] while he visited that year for a second time.  Previously, a-Bashir had visited Kenya for the signing of the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Following his visit, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc930979.pdf">reported Kenya</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">report</a>] to the UN Security Council and the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute for the violation in not arresting al-Bashir. Also following his August visit, former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan urged Kenya to reaffirm its cooperation with the ICC by <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/annan-questions-kenyas-icc-commitment-after-al-bashir-visit.php">arresting al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report].

The measure, passed by a vote of 121-33, would impose penalties on doctors who fail to comply with the new restrictions. It would provide some exceptions, permitting abortions of viable fetuses only when the woman's life is endangered by a physical illness or disability, or when continued pregnancy poses the risk of substantial physical impairment to the pregnant woman. The legislation further requires a concurring opinion from a second physician before the abortion of a viable fetus can be performed. Doctors who abort viable fetuses in violation of the late-term abortion law could face up to seven years in prison and fines between $10,000 and $50,000. The measure was approved by the Senate in April after receiving <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/missouri-house-passes-bill-restricting-late-term-abortions.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] from the House in March. The bill will now go to <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] for his signature.

<p>Missouri is just the latest of several states to impose restrictions abortions after the 20-week mark, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain. <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports] have each passed legislation this year which restricts the abortion procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports] have also recently passed legislation restricting late-term abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] had issued a <a target="_blank" href="http://download.limewire.com/injunction/Injunction.pdf">permanent injunction</a> [text, PDF] in October to prevent the site from providing online users with the software necessary to share copyrighted files. The district court ruled that the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) [trade website]  has suffered and continues to suffer irreparable harm to its business and that even a permanent injunction will not give RIAA adequate remedy for its potential future injury as a result of continued peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. The court also decided that LimeWire intentionally encouraged copyright infringement, particularly in light of its knowledge of other recent cases involving illegal file-sharing websites, like <a href="http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/MGM_v_Grokster/">Grokster</a> and <a href="http://www.eff.org/cases/aimster">Aimster</a> [EFF materials]. The RIAA welcomed the settlement agreement:<blockquote>The significant settlement underscores the Supreme Court&#8217;s unanimous ruling in the <em>Grokster</em> case&#8212;designing and operating services to profit from the theft of the world&#8217;s greatest music comes with a stiff price. The resolution of this case is another milestone in the continuing evolution of online music to a legitimate marketplace that appropriately rewards creators. This hard fought victory is reason for celebration by the entire music community, its fans and the legal services that play by the rules.</blockquote>If a settlement had not been reached, LimeWire found Mark Gorton could have been liable for as much as $1.4 billion.

<p>The US music industry has been actively litigating alleged copyright infringement in person-to-person online file sharing. In January 2010, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-reduces-192-million-jury.php">reduced</a> [JURIST report] a $1.92 million jury verdict against a Minnesota woman who was found to have violated music copyrights to about $54,000. Chief Judge Michael Davis of the <a href="http://www.mnd.uscourts.gov/index.shtml">US District Court for the District Court of Minnesota</a> [official website] called the damages amount "monstrous and shocking" and said the facts of the case could not justify the jury verdict. Davis emphasized that the defendant was an individual consumer who downloaded music for her own use and not for profit and also said that the damages to the plaintiffs, members of the RIAA, did not support the verdict. The judge ultimately decided the award should be triple the statutory minimum of $750 per song, because the defendant willfully shared 24 songs on the file-sharing program <a href="http://www.kazaa.com/">KaZaA</a> [website] and because of the need for deterrence. In 2008, the RIAA said that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/riaa-abandons-lawsuits-for-filesharing.php">discontinue its controversial policy</a> [JURIST report] of suing suspected file-sharers and instead will seek cooperation with major Internet service providers to cut off access to repeat offenders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, repressive governments are now striking back by seeking to gain control of mobile telephone networks and the Internet. "The rise of social media offer an unprecedented opportunity for human rights change&#8212;but this change stands on a knife-edge," AI said in its report. In particular, during the recent uprisings in <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-tunisia-protester-abuses.php">Tunisia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-release-of-egypt-lawyers-journalists-activists.php">Egypt</a> [JURIST reports], the governments there restricted Internet access and shut down mobile telephone networks. At the same time, AI noted other governments, including the regimes in Syria, Bahrain, Yemen and Libya have embraced more ruthless tactics to counter activism, including murder. According to AI Secretary General <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are/our-people/secretary-general">Salil Shetty</a> [official profile]:<blockquote>People are rejecting fear. Courageous people, led largely by youth, are standing up and speaking out in the face of bullets, beatings, tear gas and tanks. This bravery&#8212;combined with new technology that is helping activists to outflank and expose government suppression of free speech and peaceful protest&#8212;is sending a signal to repressive governments that their days are numbered. But there is a serious fight-back from the forces of repression. The international community must seize the opportunity for change and ensure that 2011 is not a false dawn for human rights.</blockquote>Much of the discontent that sparked the 2011 Arab revolutions was bubbling to surface even before 2011 and is reflected in AI's <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/annual-report/2011">2010 Annual Report</a> [materials].  </p>

<p>In late February, Human Rights Watch reported that more than 230 protesters had been killed within a six-day period in Libya, with the military and government supporters using live ammunition and machine guns on protesters, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">shutdown of the Internet</a> [JURIST report] and the arrest of those who spoke to foreign press. Syrian Internet users reported in early February that social media sites Facebook and YouTube <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/syria-lifts-ban-on-social-media-sites-facebook-youtube.php">are accessible</a> [JURIST report] without proxy servers or VPNs. Syria appeared to be lifting the ban imposed in 2007 as a concession <a href="http://www.dp-news.com/en/detail.aspx?articleid=73460">to avoid popular upheaval</a> [DP report] in Syria. In late January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay acknowledged reports of tactics including <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-officials-urge-egypt-to-respect-rights-of-protesters.php">rubber-coated bullets, tear gas, water cannons and batons</a> [JURIST report] in Egypt, and called on the government to investigate the reports of excessive force including civilian deaths. Pillay also pressed the government to lift the emergency law that had been in force for nearly 30 years and restore the use of mobile phones and social networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] is worried about NGO reports from Syria indicating as many as 850 people have been killed and thousands more arrested since demonstrations began in March. The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] has ordered an assessment of the situation on the ground pending approval from Syrian authorities. Also in the Middle East, reports from Bahrain have indicated incommunicado detentions and denial of due process for hundreds of people connected with protests in the country, along with the reported torture and even death of some detainees. OHCHR spokesman Rupert Colville stated:<blockquote>We reiterate our call for prompt, impartial and transparent investigations into these allegations of grave human rights violations. We are deeply concerned about the reported scale of arbitrary detention and of the trials of civilians before military courts leading to life imprisonment and death sentences, which we have already said is illegal.</blockquote>Colville also publicly urged Bahraini security forces to refrain from using force against peaceful protesters in planned upcoming demonstrations. Regarding nearby Yemen, Colville said the situation on the ground is difficult to assess due to authorities' lack of cooperation for humanitarian access, especially to afflicted areas. However, the OHCHR has condemned continued rights violations and killings across the country, and stands ready to deploy human rights officers to assess the situation, should Yemeni officials grant permission for such a visit.

<p>At the end of April, the Human Rights Council, in an emergency special session, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">publicly condemned the violence</a> [JURIST report] used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. Also last month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for Syria to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Pillay also urged the government of Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters. She expressed concern over the prosecution of medical professionals and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">death sentences</a> [JURIST report] handed to four activists last month. Earlier this month, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] urging the international community to pressure Yemeni authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/rights-group-urges-international-community-to-probe-yemen-protest-deaths.php">investigate the deaths of protesters</a> [JURIST report]. The report chronicles reports of beatings and use of excessive force by security forces including shootings of peaceful protesters. AI criticized the response of authorities to the mounting death tolls as woefully inadequate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law also imposes fines and prison sentences of up to one year for anyone who knowingly transports illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the immigration status of potential employees, providing that workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment could face up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. One report described the measure as <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/05/13/georgia.immigration.law/">one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration measures</a> [CNN report] enacted by an individual state. In addition to demonstrations outside the capitol, the legislation has drawn threats of both lawsuits and boycotts, as did similar recent anti-illegal measures in other states.

<p>The <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx">Georgia General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in April. Several other state legislatures have also acted recently to implement so-called "Arizona style" immigration laws. Last month, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] to revoke tax credits from businesses that hire illegal immigrants and require the use of the E-verify system to check the eligibility status of employees. Legislation similar to Georgia's has also been approved in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports]. Arizona's law is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">enjoined</a>, and Governor Jan Brewer has pledged to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-ask-supreme-court-to-lift-injunction-on-controversial-immigration-law.php">appeal to the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referendum would have gauged support amongst citizens of Republika Srpska for the <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/regional/article/idAFTRE74B79P20110512?edition=af">federal judiciary as well as the international envoy</a> [Reuters report]. Proponents of the referendum insist that the judiciary is biased against Serbs in war crimes cases. Critics of the referendum questioned its legality, arguing that it is a violation of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/dayton/">Dayton Accords</a> [materials], which separated Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) into two entities&#8212;Republika Srpksa is a mostly Serbian entity, and the Bosniak-Croat Federation is composed of mostly Muslims and Croats.

<p>The <a href="http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">War Crimes Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> [official website] was established in 2005 to reduce the caseload of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. In March, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-police-officer-indicted-for-role-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">confirmed the indictment of a former police officer for genocide</a> [JURIST report] for his role in the 1995 <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive]. In January, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/bosnia-war-crimes-court-sentences-muslim-commander-to-10-years.php">sentenced a Muslim commander to 10 years in prison</a> [JURIST report], overturning a 2008 acquittal regarding his failure to prevent the deaths of four prisoners in his custody and participating in their inhumane treatment.

Blai</a> [ACLU materials] had standing to sue the US government over surveillance. The plaintiffs, including attorneys, journalists and rights organizations, facially <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-new.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] Section 702 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sec_50_00001881---a000-.html">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [50 USC &#167; 1881(a)], which was added by the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d110:10:./temp/~bdeL4S::|/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=110|">FISA Amendments ACT of 2008</a> (FAA) [HR 6304 materials]. The law created procedures to allow electronic government surveillance of individuals living outside of the US for foreign intelligence purposes, which the plaintiffs alleged was violative of the Fourth Amendment, First Amendment and Article III of the Constitution. A 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] from the US District Court in Manhattan dismissed the suit after finding the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue because they did not suffer an injury in fact. A three-judge panel of the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-wiretapping-suit.php">determined that the plaintiffs had standing</a> [JURIST report] because the law put them in a "lose-lose" situation whereby they could continue with their activities and risk monitoring or they could incur financial and professional costs in order to avoid monitoring. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU} [advocacy website], one of the plaintiffs in the case, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/justice-department-asks-appeals-court-reconsider-ruling-allowing-challenge-warrant">urged the court to reject the petition for rehearing</a> [statement], calling the government's efforts to block the FAA from judicial review "disappointing and dangerous."

<p>The ACLU has been critical of other government surveillance programs. In February, Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">approved an extension of the USA Patriot Act</a> [JURIST report] with no new privacy measures, allowing for continued use of roving wiretaps, tracking of "lone wolf" terrorism suspects and the government's ability to seize "any tangible items" in the course of surveillance. The ACLU criticized Congress for failing to add civil liberty and privacy protections into the bill and instead choosing to "punt [the] critical issue down the road." In December, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ninth-circuit-rejects-patriot-act.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional challenge to the Patriot Act due to lack of standing. The <a href="http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Oregon</a> [official website] had previously ruled that certain provisions of the act were <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/doj-appealing-ruling-that-struck-down.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court said, however, that international treaties formed during that period will still stand. Siddique Ahmed, who was convicted for murder by a martial law court in 1986, challenged the constitutionality of the Seventh Amendment and sought to have his conviction overturned. The Supreme Court cancelled Siddique's trial and conviction and ordered a retrial in a lower court. The court also granted Siddique bail to be released from jail. He was serving a sentence of life imprisonment. 

<p>Ershad came to power in 1982 after ousting the elected president Justice Abdus Sattar.

The city had become a popular destination for travelers from countries where assisted suicide remains illegal, including from the neighboring countries of Germany and France. The local organization <a href="http://www.dignitas.ch/index.php?lang=de">Dignitas</a> [official website, in German] has helped more than 1,000 people take their own lives. Two conservative parties, the <a href="http://www.evppev.ch/">Evangelical People's Party</a> and the <a href="http://www.edu-schweiz.ch/cms/">Federal Democratic Union</a> [advocacy websites, in German] supported a one-year residency requirement in Zurich before being allowed to use assisted suicide services. Still, the major left and right parties urged voters to strike both referenda. Assisted suicide has been legal in Switzerland since 1941 and permits a non physician with no vested interest in death to provide passive assistance such as providing the necessary drugs. 

<p>Last year, Switzerland's <a href="http://www.admin.ch/br/index.html?lang=en">Federal Council</a> and <a href="http://www.ejpd.admin.ch/ejpd/en/home.html">Federal Department of Justice and Police</a> (FDJP) [official websites] introduced legislation to establish stricter rules on assisted suicide after a consultation with local governments, government agencies and other organizations found that 75 percent of respondents favored such a bill. In 2007, the Swiss Supreme Court ruled that people with serious mental illnesses may be permitted to commit physician assisted suicide under certain conditions. Also last year, the UK chief prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/uk-chief-prosecutor-publishes-new.php">issued a new policy</a> for prosecuting assisted suicide cases, that, while not totally legalizing the practice, introduced six public interest considerations against prosecution, including compassion of the suspect, an effort to dissuade the victim and reporting the suicide to the police. <a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org/documents/Bio_BCL.pdf">Barbara Coombs Lee</a> [President, <a href="http://www.compassionandchoices.org/">Compassion and Choices</a>] <a href="/hotline/2010/03/uk-assisted-suicide-guidelines-move.php">argued in support of the UK's measures</a> [JURIST op-ed] that assisted suicide for terminally ill adults "has become a necessity for peace of mind in an age when medical science has turned the dying process into a long, slow, tortuous path of pain and degradation of function and personhood." In the US, after a <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">ruling by the Montana supreme court</a> [JURIST report] last year, assisted suicide is now legal in three states: Montana, Oregon and Washington. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Lukashenko reportedly won 80 percent of the vote, while Sannikau was <a href = "http://www.rferl.org/content/belarus_court_sentence_opposition_leader/24108439.html">second with a distant 2.5 percent</a> [RFE/RL report]. Currently, four other presidential candidates are awaiting trial, while one was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/belarus-releases-7-detainees-including-presidential-candidate.php">released in January</a> [JURIST report], and another has fled Belarus to seek asylum in the Czech Republic. All of the <a href = "http://www.belhelcom.org/en/node/13077">detained protesters</a> [Belarusian Helsinki Committee] are accused of violating Article 293 of the Criminal Code of Belarus, for inciting and participating in riots. In addition to maintaining that the election was rigged, Sannikau alleged confessions he gave before the trial were extracted under torture and threats to his family. Both the <a href = "http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/05/163350.htm">US</a> [press statement] and the <a href = "http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/121990.pdf">European Union</a> (EU) [press release, PDF] have condemned Sannikau's conviction and the ongoing trials, with the US considering all those arrested on December 19 as "political prisoners" and promising to consider Belarus' human rights violations in future dealings with the nation.

<p><a href = "/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were also arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <a href = "/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports]. While Lukashenko has since sought to improve his country's ties with western nations, the US State Department has historically <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/state-department-deplores-rights.php">criticized Belarus' human rights record</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href = "/paperchase/2007/11/un-committee-concerned-about-belarus.php">UN General Assembly Third Committee</a> and the <a href = "/paperchase/2007/03/soviet-style-rights-abuses-widespread.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> [JURIST reports] have similarly denounced Belarus for human rights abuses. In 2008, the Belarus KGB <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/belarus-kgb-detains-journalists.php">detained at least 16 journalists</a> [JURIST report] and searched their homes and offices for materials that allegedly libel Lukashenko. Also in 2008, Belarusian district courts <a href = "/paperchase/2008/03/belarus-courts-sentence-protesters.php">sentenced at least 55 demonstrators</a> [JURIST report], including journalists, for participating in a banned "Freedom Day" rally in Minsk to protest the presidency of Lukashenko. An opposition activist who was critical of Lukashenko during his 2006 presidential campaign was <a href = "/paperchase/2006/06/belarus-opposition-activist-gets-3.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to three years in jail in 2008 by a Belarusian court after being arrested for making comments that Lukashenko was connected to the disappearances of opposition leaders Yuri Zakharenko, Viktor Gonchar and Anatoly Krasovsky.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ocampo said his office has gathered evidence that Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi, plotted together to orchestrate attacks on civilians. He said Saif al-Islam was acting as a "defacto Prime Minister" and called al-Sanussi, Gaddafi's "right-hand man" and "executioner." Ocampo said his office was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13408931">almost prepared for trial</a> [BBC report], having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya. Ocampo said:<blockquote>Muammar Gaddafi committed the crimes with the goal of preserving his authority. ... The [ICC prosecutor's office] was able to gather direct evidence about orders issued by Muammar Gaddafi himself. The evidence shows that Gaddafi relied on his inner circle to implement a systematic policy of suppressing any challenge to his authority.</blockquote> The ICC judges still have to approve the arrest warrants. The Pre-Trial chamber may deny the request, approve it or ask for additional information before issuing the warrants. The Libyan government has already said it will ignore the warrants and criticized the authority of the ICC over African leaders.

<p>Ocampo had previously said that his office was planning to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-has-evidence-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-prosecutor.php">seek five arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] in connection with Gaddafi's administration. He indicated that there was strong evidence of Gaddafi's involvement in various crimes against humanity, including the shooting of civilians, massive arrests, torture and forced disappearances. Ocampo revealed in April that his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icc-prosecutor-claims-to-have-evidence-gaddafi-planned-attacks-on-civilians.php">uncovered evidence</a> [JURIST report] that Gaddafi planned to attack civilians to forestall regime-toppling revolution. Ocampo indicated that the plans were made in response to the conflicts in Tunisia and Egypt and included shooting civilians. In March, Ocampo told the press that he was 100 percent certain his office would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-certain-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-charges.php">bring charges</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi. Also in March, the ICC launched a probe into <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">allegations of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] by the Libyan government. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The issue is whether the court should imply a cause of action under <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion text] against individual employees of private companies that contract with the federal government to provide prison services, where the plaintiff has adequate alternative remedies for the harm alleged and the defendants have no employment or contractual relationship with the government. Respondent Richard Lee Pollard sustained injuries while in federal prison and filed suit against the private company that had contracted with the government to run the facility, as well as several of its employees, alleging a violation of his <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] rights. A district court dismissed Pollard's case, finding that alternative and superior remedies were available in state court, but the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/05-12-Minneci-opinion-below.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF], creating a split among the circuit courts.

<p>Also Monday, the court declined to hear an appeal on the CIA's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition program</a> [JURIST news archive]. In a September <em>en banc</em> rehearing, the full US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ninth-circuit-dismisses-cia-rendition-suit-on-state-secrets-grounds.php">affirmed</a> the district court's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/federal-court-dismisses-lawsuit-against.php">dismiss the suit</a> [JURIST reports] against Boeing subsidiary <a href="http://www.jeppesen.com">Jeppesen Dataplan</a> [corporate website] on the basis of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=state+secrets+privilege">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>The court also declined to rule on an attempt to remove the phrase "so help me God" from the presidential oath. The challenge was brought by atheist <a href="/currentawareness/newdow.php">Michael Newdow</a> [JURIST news archive] and several other groups, who claimed the phrase violates the Establishment Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text].

The <a href="http://courts.ky.gov/supremecourt/">Kentucky Supreme Court</a> [official website] held, despite the existence of exigent circumstances, a warrantless arrest was not supported because the police should reasonably have foreseen that their action would create the exigency. However, the US Supreme Court's opinion by Justice Samuel Alito held the police action does not create an exception to the exigent circumstances rule unless it violates the Fourth Amendment. In this case, since knocking on the door was lawful, the exigent circumstances created by the destruction of evidence supported the warrantless arrests. Alito argued that the occupants were under no obligation to open the door: "Occupants who choose not to stand on their constitutional rights but instead elect to attempt to destroy evidence have only themselves to blame for the warrantless exigent-circumstances search that may ensue." Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissent, arguing that court's ruling violates two Fourth Amendment principles: first, that warrantless arrests inside homes require higher scrutiny, and secondly, that, whenever practical, police should first acquire a warrant from a neutral magistrate.

<p>The Supreme Court's ruling laid to rest a circuit court split with five different tests being used to determine whether the police-created exigency exception applied, with the states developing more. The Kentucky Supreme Court had applied a two-pronged test whereby a warrantless arrest is not allowed when either the police deliberately created the exigency in bad faith or whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the police action would create an exigency.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Amara</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-california-prison-overcrowding-case.php">report</a>] that a district court incorrectly ordered relief under the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/erisa.htm">Employee Retirement Income Security Act</a> (ERISA) [materials]. The court had been asked to determine what "showing" is required to entitle participants in the pension plan to recover benefits where there has been an alleged inconsistency between the explanation of benefits and the terms of the plan. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit applied a "likely harm" standard when affirming the district court's ruling that plaintiffs were entitled to additional benefits. The Supreme Court found that the district court was not authorized to grant relief under ERISA's recovery-of-benefits-due provision but that a different provision authorized similar relief, remanding the case to the district court for reconsideration. Justin Stephen Breyer wrote for the majority:<blockquote>The upshot is that we can agree with CIGNA only to a limited extent. We believe that, to obtain relief by surcharge for violations of &#167;&#167;102(a) and 104(b), a plan participant or beneficiary must show that the violation injured him or her. But to do so, he or she need only show harm and causation. Although it is not always necessary to meet the more rigorous standard implicit in the words "detrimental reliance," actual harm must be shown.

<p>We are not asked to reassess the evidence. And we are not asked about the other prerequisites for relief. We are asked about the standard of prejudice. And we conclude that the standard of prejudice must be borrowed from equitable principles, as modified by the obligations and injuries identified by ERISA itself. Information-related circumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too various in nature to insist that harm must always meet that more vigorous "detrimental harm" standard when equity imposed no such strict requirement.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia filed an an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor took no part in the decision.</p>

<p>The circuit courts have been deeply divided over the issue of what standard to apply, with some requiring a showing of prejudice or reliance in order to recover benefits and others only requiring a discrepancy between the explanation of benefits and the terms of the plan. The Second Circuit has been the only circuit to apply the "likely harm" standard.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

US ex rel. Kirk</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-child-abuse-investigations-public-information-disclosures.php">report</a>] that a written response to a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=freedom+of+information+act">news archive</a>] request is a "report" within the exception to a federal whistleblower law. Daniel Kirk brought a <em>qui tam</em> suit under the False Claims Act (FCA) alleging that his former employer Schindler Elevator had submitted hundreds of false claims under its federal contracts after he learned of the false claims from documents his wife received from a FOIA request. The Civil War-era FCA authorizes private citizens, dubbed <em>qui tam</em> relators, to sue on behalf of the US accusing federal contractors of fraudulent claims against the government. However, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/31/usc_sec_31_00003730----000-.html">FCA public disclosure bar</a> [31 USC &#167; 3730(e)(4)] forecloses <em>qui tam</em> suits "based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions ... in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation." The five-justice majority opinion by Clarence Thomas held that the written response to the FOIA request met the definition of report, thus precluding Kirk from bringing his <em>qui tam</em> suit. The court found that the ordinary meaning of the term "report" supported including the FOIA response. Furthermore, Thomas noted that precluding a <em>qui tam</em> suit in this case was supported by the public disclosure bar's rationale to prevent windfalls to <em>qui tam</em> relators. Three justices dissented arguing that the FOIA documents only reinforced Kirk's own impressions from his experience working for Schindler Elevator and that FOIA documents should not automatically fall under the public disclosure bar. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself.

<p>The ruling overturned the decision by the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9964a2e0-1216-4de3-a1fe-ae3940a0e8e0/1/doc/09-1678-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/9964a2e0-1216-4de3-a1fe-ae3940a0e8e0/1/hilite/">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the FOIA information was not a report or investigation under the statute and was not barred from litigation. The Supreme Court specifically rejected the circuit court's argument applying the <em>noscitur a sociis</em> canon to find that the meaning of report was narrower than the ordinary meaning based on the words immediately neighboring it. At oral arguments, counsel for Schindler Elevator argued that the circuit court decision opens the door to "a host of lawsuits by relators with no meaningful information to contribute," which is a situation that the public disclosure bar was created to prevent. In response, counsel for the government and Kirk argued that Schindler's overly broad application of the public disclosure bar harms the policy goal of "encourag[ing] whistleblowers specifically to use government records in their investigations" under the False Claims Act. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Kuala Lumpur High Court <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/05/16/malaysia.anwar/">ruling</a> [CNN report] forces Anwar to enter his defense to the charge that he sodomized a former male political aide. Judge Zabidin Mohamad Diah said the testimony of the aide was credible, finding the evidence sufficient for a <em>prima facie</em> case against Anwar. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. This is the second sodomy case launched against Anwar who is expected to take the stand when the trial resumes June 6. Anwar has consistently argued that the allegations are a politically motivated attempt to silence the opposition. The continuance of the trial <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/16/us-malaysia-anwar-idUSTRE74F0IS20110516">may strengthen</a> [Reuters report] Prime Minister Najib Razak's majority government. A general election is expected to be called this year even though one is not due until 2013.

<p>Anwar was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST reports] in late June. Last December, Anwar <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/malaysia-opposition-leader-files-complaint-over-wikileaks-sodomy-cable.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in a Malaysian court over a <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. The leaked US diplomatic cable claimed Australia's <a href="http://www.ona.gov.au/">Office of National Assessments</a> [official website] had concluded, in agreement with Singapore's Intelligence Agency, that the sodomy charges against Anwar were the result of a set-up, but that he was in fact guilty of committing the acts. Last year, the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/courts/maljudiciary.shtml">Federal Court of Malaysia</a> [official website], the country's highest court, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/malaysia-high-court-rejects-former-opposition-leaders-defamation-suit.php">rejected Anwar's 2006 defamation suit</a> against against former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] for allegedly suggesting at a human rights conference that Anwar was unfit for office because of his supposed homosexuality. Anwar was Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister under former Mahathir Mohamad until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Sixth Colloquium of International Prosecutors took place over two days in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and included international prosecutors from the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC), the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY), the <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> (SCSL), the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR), the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) and the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) [official websites]. Prosecutors addressed the need for cooperation from states in transferring fugitives to the international courts and tribunals before they close and thus lose the ability to prosecute suspects:
<blockquote>[We] STRESS the urgent need to locate, arrest and transfer fugitives to the international criminal courts and tribunals whose closures are fast approaching [and] URGE national authorities to ensure full commitment to the end of impunity and to eliminating safe havens for those suspected or indicted for international crimes [and] RECOGNISE the essential support and cooperation of States in enabling international criminal courts and tribunals to pursue their respective mandates.</blockquote>The SCSL is the first tribunal scheduled to close its operations following completion of the prosecution of former Liberian president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2963086.stm">Charles Taylor</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/taylor.php">news archive</a>]. Taylor is <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-begins-defense.php">charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] including murder, rape, sexual slavery and acts of terrorism.

<p>This is not the first time a delegation of international criminal prosecutors has come together to urge the support of the international community. In September, current and former international prosecutors signed the fourth <a href="/paperchase/IHL%20Dialogs%20The%20Fourth%20Chautauqua%20Declaration%20August%2031%202010%5B1%5D.pdf">Chautauqua Declaration</a> [text, PDF] praising recent advances in international law and <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/prosecutors-urge-continued-support-of-international-tribunals.php">urging countries to continue supporting the international courts</a> [JURIST report] in order to maintain the spirit of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/full/390">Nuremburg Principles</a> [text]. At that time, prosecutors also urged countries to fulfill their obligations under international law by investigating and prosecuting, or transferring to the appropriate international court, suspects who violate international criminal law, including sitting heads of state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last Thursday, a German court in Munich found the 91-year-old Demjanjuk guilty of assisting in the murder of nearly 28,000 Jews while serving as a guard at the Sobibor death camp. He was sentenced to five years in prison, less than the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-prosecutor-requests-6-year-sentence-for-alleged-nazi-guard.php">six years sought by the prosecution</a> [JURIST report]. But Judge Ralph Alt <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15068941,00.html">ordered his release</a> [DW report] because of his advanced age and because the verdict is not final. Appeals could take another year or more. With no surviving witnesses, Demjanjuk was convicted based on wartime documents as prosecutors proved he was guilty because he worked at the death camp. Germany's chief Nazi war crimes investigator also stated that there are <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE74F49Y20110516?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">two investigations underway</a> [Reuters report] that are similar to the Demjanuk case. 

<p>Demjanjuk's trial <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009 but was marked by extensive delay. Last May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss the charges</a> [JURIST report] filed by the defense, which argued there was a lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the argument, saying they found the evidence against Demjanjuk to be strong. In October 2009, Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a> after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/germany-court-blocks-stay-of.php">rejected appeals relating to his health</a> [JURIST reports], although the court limited hearings to no more than two 90-minute sessions per day. Demjanjuk fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. He was living in the United States deported to Germany after the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">denied his stay of deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLJ filed an <a href="http://www.aclj.org/media/pdf/HC-CTA-Opening-Brief-FILED-20110516.pdf">appeal</a> [brief, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] asking the court to reverse a lower court <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">decision to dismiss the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] last February, and enjoin the enforcement of the the part of the health reform law known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The brief argues PPACA's mandate that individual citizens purchase and maintain health insurance is unconstitutional because it is beyond Congress' power under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The brief says:<blockquote>The individual mandate is unconstitutional because it exceeds even the outermost bounds of Congress's Article I authority and is inconsistent with the constitutional system of dual sovereignty that divides power between the federal and State governments. ... Congress cannot 'regulate' inactivity by requiring individuals to buy a good or service as a condition of their lawful residence in the United States, and Congress does not have <em>carte blanche</em> to include unconstitutional provisions within a larger scheme of commercial regulation.</blockquote>The brief further argues that the PPACA violates the two of the plaintiff's rights under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sup_01_42_10_21B.html">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) [42 USC &#167; 2000bb text] because they believe the individual mandate "would violate their religious belief that God will protect them from illness or injury" or force them to have to pay penalties for refusing to violate their faith. The ACLJ also filed amicus briefs in challenges to the health care reform law by the states of Florida and Virginia.

<p>Last February, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] dismissed the ACLJ's lawsuit, ruling that Congress acted within its constitutional powers in passing the health care reform law. The court also found that the RFRA was not violated since the PPACA allows individuals to make a payment in lieu of coverage and the individual mandate is essential to the PPACA. The court concluded that the individual mandate was not a substantial burden on the plaintiffs' Christian faith and it is the "least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest." Also last February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked federal judge Roger Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">clarify that states must continue to enact the PPACA</a> as the government appeals from Vinson's January ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">finding the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. There is also an ongoing challenge in Virginia over a split decision in the US district courts with the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against individual mandate provision</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports]. In October, a federal judge in Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the law is constitutional under the Commerce Clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bizimungu was sentenced to 30 years in prison while two others, Francois-Xavier  Nzuwonemeye and Innocent Sagahutu, to 20 years in prison and Augustin Ndindiliyimana to time served since his arrest in 2000. Bizimungu was found guilty on six counts of genocide and crimes against humanity for murder, extermination and rape in addition of violations of Common Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/">Geneva Conventions</a> [text]. However, all four were acquitted on the charge of conspiracy to commit genocide with the court saying that it did not believe the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the all four were involved in such a conspiracy. Bizimungu was arrested in August of 2002 in Angola and transferred to the tribunal in in 2004. During the genocide, Bizimungu <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2002/08/15/rwanda-top-genocidaire-arrest-important-step">ordered soldiers and policeman to exterminate</a> [HRW report] tens of thousands of Tutsi civilians who had taken refuge in churches, hospitals and schools. The soldiers and police also forced ordinary civilians to join in the hunting down and killing of Tutsis under the threat of punishment.  

<p>Last December, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ictr-convicts-former-military-officer-of-genocide.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan Armed Forces lieutenant Ildephonse Hategekimana to life imprisonment after convicting him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. The court found Hategekimana guilty of three counts of genocide stemming from his involvement in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, specifically in the massacre of civilian Tutsis in the Rwandan town of Butare. Last month, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ictr-removes-us-defense-lawyer-from-tribunal-work.php">removed</a> US lawyer and JURIST <a href="/forum/">Forum</a> [website] contributor <a href="http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> [professional profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=erlinder">news archive</a>] from his position as an ICTR defense lawyer. The appeals chamber said the dismissal was due to Erlinder's failure to appear at a tribunal and cited <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/rules/260600/index.htm">Rule 46 of the ICTR Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [text] which allows the court impose sanctions for lawyer's misconduct. Erlinder <a href="/forum/2011/05/peter-erlinder-ictr-genocide-denial.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] the dismissal was part of a wider history of institutional bias that has helped the Rwandan government label him and other defense counsel "genocide deniers" subject to official threats of arrest and even death. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Minnesota law was being challenged by two non-profit advocacy organizations and a for-profit business which argued the law was in violation of the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>] making it unconstitutional to ban corporations from making independent expenditures, meaning political speech not coordinated with a particular candidate. The <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=211B.15">Minnesota law</a> [text] forces corporations to contribute to a registered political fund subject to a various statutory requirements including the filing of disclosure reports. The <a href="http://www.mccl.org/">Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life</a>, the <a href="http://www.taxpayersleague.org/">Taxpayer League of Minnesota</a> [advocacy websites] and the for-profit <a href="http://www.coastaltravelinc.com/index.htm">Coastal Travel Enterprises</a> [official website] argued that such requirements violate <span class="casename">Citizens United's</span> proscription on banning corporate independent expenditures and its ban on forcing corporations to make donations through Political Action Committees. However, the court held that:<blockquote>Minnesota did not ban corporate independent expenditures. Instead, based upon the lower court's findings, as strongly supported by the record, we find that Minnesota created a statutory scheme designed to require corporations to disclose certain information when making independent expenditures. ... Based upon the record before the district court, Minnesota appears to have adequately tailored its laws because, as we found in the previous section, Minnesota's provisions collectively impose no materially greater burden on corporations than the disclosure laws at issue in <span class="casename">Citizens United</span>.</blockquote>The Minnesota finance law was at the center of controversy when one of the disclosure reports showed that <a href="http://sites.target.com/site/en/company/page.jsp?ref=nav_footer_about&contentId=WCMP04-032391">Target</a>, <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=244152&p=irol-overview">Best Buy</a> [corporate websites] and other corporations had <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/121895804.html?source=error">donated money</a> [<em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em> report] to a group supporting Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer. His stance against same-sex marriage caused protests against the companies.

<p>Campaign finance regulation has been in a state of flux since <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> was decided in January of last year. Last month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a>  [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-upholds-wisconsin-supreme-court-campaign-finance-law.php">dismissed two challenges</a> [JURIST report] to campaign financing schemes for Wisconsin Supreme Court elections. Last March, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in two consolidated campaign finance cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-238.pdf">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] forbids states from providing publicly financed candidates with additional government subsidies, which are triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates or by the candidates' privately financed opponents. In <span class="casename">McComish v. Bennett</span>, the court will determine whether Arizona's matching funds and the law regulating campaign financing to equalize resources among candidates and interest groups, rather than advancing a compelling state interest in the least restrictive manner, violate the First and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay said that statistics show that <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38406&Cr=Pillay&Cr1">homophobic-based crimes are on the rise</a> [UN News Centre report] around the world, urging that states act to stop this trend. Homosexuality remains a criminal offense in more than 70 countries, and Pillay argues that states have an obligation to decriminalize the behavior under international law. In a video message, Pillay said homophobia and transphobia are the same as other condemned forms of prejudice:<blockquote>Homophobia and transphobia are no different to sexism, misogyny, racism, or xenophobia, but whereas these last forms of prejudice are universally condemned by governments, homophobia and transphobia are two often overlooked. Each and everyone of us is entitled to the same rights, to the same respect, and ethical treatment regardless of our sexual orientation or gender identity.</blockquote>

<p>In the US, some measures have been taken to stop hate crimes against LGBT individuals. In March, US <a href="http://polis.house.gov/">Representative Jared Polis</a> (D-CO) and <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Al Franken</a> (D-MN) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-legislators-introduce-bill-ending-bullying-in-federally-funded-schools.php">introduced legislation to protect LGBT students</a> [JURIST report] in federally funded public elementary and high schools from bullying. In 2009, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-defense-authorization-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that contained a measure extending the definition of federal hate crimes to include crimes motivated by gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Homosexuality remains a crime in many countries including Uganda, which has been harshly criticized throughout the international community since the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8308912.stm">introduction</a> [BBC report] in October 2009 of its <a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/btb/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Bill-No-18-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill-2009.pdf">Anti-Homosexuality Bill</a> [text, PDF], which has since been stalled in the Parliament. The bill would impose harsh penalties for homosexuality, including death in some circumstances, and imposes punishments of up to three years in prison for individuals, including family members, who fail to report offenders. Uganda currently <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8412962.stm">criminalizes homosexual behavior</a> [BBC report] with up to 14 years in prison. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ieng, 85, served as deputy foreign minister under the Khmer Rouge regime during its reign in Cambodia from 1975-1979. Citing Rules 63(6-7) and 68(1) of the <a href="http://www.dccam.org/Tribunal/Documents/ECCC_IRs_English1.pdf">Internal Rules of the ECCC</a> [text, PDF] and Article 210 of the <a href="http://cambodia.ohchr.org/KLC_pages/KLC_files/section_011/section11_013_2007_fr.pdf">Cambodian Code of Criminal Procedure</a> [text, PDF, in French], he argued that the court had no authority to detain a prisoner for more than three years without certain substantive rulings, making his detention illegal since November 2010. Taking a different interpretation of the statutes and emphasizing the need to prevent the defendant from fleeing, the court denied Ieng's request:<blockquote>[The Chamber has been] provided with limited practical particulars in support of the Defence request for bail. ... At the hearing, the Defence merely expressed the hope that either the Royal Government of Cambodia or the ECCC would be in a position to provide security, transportation and medical care for the Accused if he were detained outside the ECCC Detention Facility. It has not provided ... any guarantee that the Accused would respect summons to appear in court. The Chamber therefore finds continued detention at the ECCC to be necessary to ensure the presence of the Accused during trial proceedings[.]</blockquote>Ieng faces charges of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in connection with the deaths of more than 2 million Cambodians in the Khmer Rouge "Killing Fields."

<p>Ieng's co-defendants in <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/2">ECCC Case 2</a> [materials], <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/nuon-chea">Nuon Chea</a>, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/ieng-thirith">Ieng Thirith</a> [ECCC backgrounders] have all challenged pretrial custody unsuccessfully.

In its newest annual report, the <a href="http://www.ichr.ps">Independent Commission for Human Rights</a> (ICHR) [advocacy website] accuses the PA of torture, onerous security screenings and arbitrary detentions, while also accusing Hamas of torture and arbitrary arrests. The report warns the organizations not to allow Palestinians' rights to be suppressed by overwhelming security apparatuses, citing recent revolts in Arab states such as <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bahrain">Bahrain</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=libya">Libya</a> [JURIST news archives] as the consequences of oppressive use of police power.

<p>Accusations of human rights violations in the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/oPt.html">Palestinian territories</a> [UNICEF backgrounder], not just by Israel but by the PA and Hamas as well, continue to be of international concern. In January, UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk alleged that Israeli authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-official-expresses-concern-over-violence-against-palestinians.php">continued to commit illegal acts that threaten the viability of the Palestinian state</a> [JURIST report] in the Palestinian territories, including the killing of four Palestinians by <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website]. Last September, a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/FactFindingMission.htm">UN panel of experts</a> [UN materials] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-panel-criticizes-israel-hamas-investigations-into-gaza-strip-conflict.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] investigations carried out by Israel and Hamas into the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">2008-2009 conflict in the Gaza Strip</a> [JURIST news archives], but praised the PA's report, which it said comported with international standards.

In February, Danilkin's assistant accused the judge of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/khodorkovsky-verdict-product-of-coercion-judges-assistant.php">not writing the verdict</a> [JURIST report] and stated he was <a href = "http://gazeta.ru/politics/2011/02/14_a_3524202.shtml#">coerced into reading it</a> [interview text, in Russian]. Khodorkovsky's lawyers allege that Danilkin committed fraud and forgery and knowingly made unfair judgments. The appeal alleges that the verdict does not identify acts implying criminal liability, that there were fundamental and irreparable violations of due process and that the verdict contradicts previous rulings:<blockquote>The verdict subsequently issued in the second criminal case against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev&#8212;most likely to be enshrined as "sacred" by the appellate court&#8212;does in fact rely upon canceling and changing laws of formal logic and commonly known facts. The verdict is a knowing and willful fictional description of purported criminal conduct, devoid of corpus delicti, blind to the preponderance of exculpatory evidence and built upon a bulldozing of due process. Should it be upheld as expected upon appeal, the verdict will stand as a monumental embarrassment to the Russian judiciary and to those state officials who seek to portray it as a valid act of justice.</blockquote>The appeal hearing has been <a href = "http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/laughter-greets-khodorkovsky-delay/436988.html">postponed for a week</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report], so judges can fully understand Khodorkovsky's claims. Supporters of Khodorkovsky assert that this is to prevent <a href = "http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Dmitry+Medvedev">news archive</a>] from being questioned on the trial during his press conference on Wednesday.

<p>In December, Danilkin <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Khodorkovsky and his business partner, <a href = "http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Platon+Lebedev">news archive</a>], to six additional years in prison, extending their imprisonment to a total of 14 years. Their defense counsel staunchly criticized the ruling, <a href = "http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-denfense-team-statement-verdict">claiming</a> [press release] that the court blocked significant amounts of testimony and evidence submitted by the defense and systematically quashed objections to their omission. The verdict drew vehement <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from US <A href = "http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href = "http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution."

The bill removes the 180-day rule that only requires a warrant to search e-mails that are unopened and stored for less than 180 days. In 1986, e-mail was only <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/cloud-content-warrants/">stored on servers briefly</a> [Wired report] before being delivered to the the recipient's inbox, and e-mail older than six months was assumed to be abandoned. Leahy, who is the chairman of the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website], expressed the need to update the EPCA, passed in 1986, to bring it up to speed with the vast changes in Internet communication. He made a <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/press/press_releases/release/?id=b6d1f687-f2f7-48a4-80bc-29e3c5f758f2#Summary">statement</a> [press release] that, at the time, the EPCA was one of the nation's premier privacy laws:<blockquote>But, today, this law is significantly outdated and out-paced by rapid changes in technology and the changing mission of our law enforcement agencies after September 11. Updating this law to reflect the realities of our time is essential to ensuring that our federal privacy laws keep pace with new technologies and the new threats to our security.</blockquote> The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/important-electronic-privacy-information-legislation-introduced-senate">lauded the proposed legislation</a> [press release] as a step forward but said more protections are needed such as stricter reporting requirements to inform the public how the surveillance powers are being used and a suppression remedy to exclude improperly obtained evidence from trial.

<p>Last year, the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] came under fire after it was discovered it had <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/fbi-illegally-collected-phone-records.php">collected more than 2,000 telephone records</a> [JURIST report] between 2002 and 2006 by claiming the phone calls being made related to possible terrorism emergencies. The collection of telephone records on the basis of non-existent emergencies is a violation of the EPCA. In 2005, the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] held that the EPCA  <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-e.php">should be broadly interpreted</a> [JURIST report] to allow an e-mail provider alleged to have read correspondence in transit to customers to be tried on federal charges. The federal government <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/councilman/default.html">filed suit</a> [EPIC backgrounder] against Bradford Councilman, former vice president of online bookseller Interloc, which is now part of <a href="http://www.alibris.com/">Alibris</a> [corporate website], alleging the defendant provided customers with e-mail addresses and then directed employees to write code that would save and copy inbound communications from Amazon.com to those addresses before they were delivered.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The massacre involved the torture and execution of 22 political prisoners mostly belonging to the Montoneros, an urban guerrilla rebel group, on December 13, 1976, as they were transported between prisons. The military maintained that the prisoners were armed and attacked them. One officer was <a href = "http://www.clarin.com/politica/Perpetua-represores-masacre-Margarita-Belen_0_482351836.html">found not guilty</a> [Clarin report, in Spanish].

<p>Argentina continues to prosecute those accused of committing human rights abuses during the Dirty War.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmyanmar.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Myanmar began releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners Tuesday as part of an amnesty program after a visit from a special envoy from the UN secretary-general, but rights groups claim the government has not gone far enough. On Monday, President Thein Sein <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2011/05/18/Myanmar-frees-prisoners-under-an-amnesty/UPI-27031305713520/">issued an order</a> [UPI report] commuting death sentences to life sentences and commuting prison sentences by one year. The UN secretary-general's envoy to Myanmar, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=117">Vijay Nambiar</a> [official profile], visited the country from May 11-13 and called on the government to release all of its political prisoners. But few of the prisoners being released by the government are political prisoners. Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/05/16/burma-prisoner-amnesty-mocks-pledge-improve-rights">criticized the response</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The government's gesture will be welcomed by a great many prisoners in Burma, but for the 2,100 political prisoners unjustly serving sentences of up to 65 years, the one-year reduction is a sick joke. This is a pathetic response to international calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners.</blockquote>HRW is also calling on Myanmar to eliminate the death penalty entirely. The government maintains its position that it is <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/05/17/international/i011445D77.DTL">not detaining any political prisoners</a> [AP report]. 

<p>In March, Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">underwent a transfer of power</a> [BBC report] from a military regime to a civil system after holding its first elections in 20 years. However, critics argue that the new regime is merely a sham since it is made up of military generals and with the military party winning 80 percent of the vote. Last December, a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] expert <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tomas+ojea+quintana">news archive</a>], a UN Special Rapporteur, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">urged Myanmar's military government</a> [JURIST report] to release 2,202 political prisoners. Quintana called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," many of whom, he says, suffer from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy. Last November, Myanmar's government released pro-democracy leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>], ending her almost eight years under house arrest.

In a <a href = "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/international/2011/May/international_May803.xml&section=international">letter sent to Libyan Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi</a> [AFP report], Ocampo warned against diplomats covering up crimes for Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>]. Further, Ocampo alleged that cover-ups in Libya go so far that <a href = "http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=46188">any trace of a crime is destroyed</a> [Middle East Online report]. Ocampo announced Monday that he is <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">seeking arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi and two others in his "inner circle" on charges of crimes against humanity. Libya's government spokesman Mussa Ibrahim dismissed this, stating the court has no jurisdiction over Tripoli and denied that any war crimes had occurred.

<p>Ocampo had previously said that his office was planning to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/icc-has-evidence-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-prosecutor.php">seek five arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] in connection with Gaddafi's administration. He indicated that there was strong evidence of Gaddafi's involvement in various crimes against humanity, including the shooting of civilians, massive arrests, torture and forced disappearances. Ocampo revealed in April that his office had <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icc-prosecutor-claims-to-have-evidence-gaddafi-planned-attacks-on-civilians.php">uncovered evidence</a> [JURIST report] that Gaddafi planned to attack civilians to forestall regime-toppling revolution. Ocampo indicated that the plans were made in response to the conflicts in Tunisia and Egypt and included shooting civilians. In March, Ocampo told the press that he was 100 percent certain his office would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-certain-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-charges.php">bring charges</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi.

He said the information was released pursuant to tribunal rules "to ensure that the public is duly informed about ongoing ECCC proceedings."

Ieng, 85, served as deputy foreign minister under the Khmer Rouge regime during its reign in Cambodia from 1975-1979.

President of the Security Council, Gerard Araud, <a href = "http://www.franceonu.org/spip.php?article5565">spoke</a> [text] on the DRC's "peace and security, the forthcoming elections, governance and institution building, and economic development":<blockquote>The Security Council stresses the need for urgent progress, with regard to governance and institution building, on judicial reform and support to domestic courts, in order to ensure the rule of law and strengthen the fight against impunity. In this regard, the Council notes the interest of the Congolese authorities for establishing specialized mixed courts to address serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, complemented by their existing cooperation with the International Criminal Court.</blockquote>Earlier, Ban also <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5278">discussed</a> [text] these four areas for development and emphasized the continued importance of the <A href = "http://monusco.unmissions.org/">UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a> (MONUC) [official website].

<p>The DRC continues to be a center for turmoil in Africa. In March, a military court  <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/drc-military-court-jails-army-officers-for-rape.php">sentenced 11 army officers</a> [JURIST report] to prison for raping more than 20 women last year.

Eight of his troops were also given prison sentences of between 10 and 20 years and expelled from the army for their involvement in the attack. The DRC has been called the <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8650112.stm">rape capital of the world</a> [BBC report] by senior UN officials. Members of the UN Security Council <A href = "http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/sc10016.doc.htm">expressed "outrage"</a> [statement] last August over a different mass rape in the DRC, calling for <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/un-security-council-urges-justice-for-drc-rape-victims.php">justice for the victims</a> [JURIST report]. In December 2009, <A href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged MONUC to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/un-dr-congo-mission-urged-to-stop.php">stop funding military groups</a> [JURIST report] in the country that are committing human rights abuses. MONUC has been operating in DRC since 1999. The conflict in the DRC has claimed more than four million lives and has been ongoing since 1983.

Ocampo has said that his office will launch a formal investigation into the mass killings. Ouattara was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704810504576307313431489094.html">sworn into office</a> [WSJ report] earlier in May after months of conflict between his forces and those loyal to former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] who refused to leave office. Ouattara's forces, with the help of French military, finally captured Gbagbo in April after besieging his residence. 

<p>In April, a <a href="hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.

Staff Sgt. David Bram of <a href="http://info.lewis-mcchord.army.mil/">Joint Base Lewis-McChord</a> [official website] is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/18/us-soldiers-crimes-idUSTRE74H0C920110518?feedType=RSS&feedName=domesticNews">charged</a> [Reuters report] with solicitation to commit premeditated murder, failure to report crimes including murder, planting evidence near the body of an Afghan national, unlawfully engaging in murder scenario conversations with subordinates and aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon. Bram is the sixth soldier from the 5th Stryker Brigade to be charged in connection with the three Afghan deaths, which took place between January and May of last year in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. A military investigation revealed that soldiers from the brigade had been plotting since 2009 to kill unarmed Afghans and stage them to look like casualties of combat. Another soldier, Specialist <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=morlock">Jeremy Morlock</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-solider-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March to three counts of murder as well as single counts of assault, conspiracy, obstructing justice and illegal drug use in exchange for a maximum sentence of 24 years in prison. Morlock <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i1fm8fHOXlx3hsxUYl4jD5LLB6lQ?docId=338bda7cf215485cbbde38a01d588fe2">described Bram's involvement in his plea agreement</a> [AP report], claiming that Bram overhead other soldiers planning civilian deaths and told Morlock that it was clear to go ahead with one of the killings in January 2010.  Bram faces up to 21 years in prison if convicted of all charges against him.

<p>This does not mark the first time Bram will face charges before a military tribunal for misconduct. Bram was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/second-us-charged-in-probe-into-afghan-civilian-deaths.php">court-martialed in November</a> [JURIST report] for charges unrelated to the murders. He was accused of severely beating an Army private in his unit to keep the soldier from informing superiors about alleged drug abuse within the unit. The charges included conspiracy to commit assault and battery, unlawfully striking another soldier, violating a lawful order, dereliction of duty, cruelty, maltreatment and endeavoring to impede an investigation. The probe into 12 members of the 5th Stryker Brigade regarding the civilian deaths <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/us-military-launches-investigation-into-afghanistan-civilian-deaths.php">began in May 2010</a> [JURIST report]. Staff Sgt. Robert Stevens, another member of the brigade, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-firing-on-unarmed-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty in December</a> [JURIST report] to shooting two unarmed Afghan farmers following a plea agreement that will allow him to remain in the military after serving a nine month sentence and testifying against other soldiers accused of terrorizing civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ argued that the health care reform law is constitutional due to the overwhelming burden on interstate commerce without the law's enactment:<blockquote>Plaintiffs do not dispute that the commerce power allows Congress to regulate how people pay for services in the vast interstate health care services market, which is quintessential economic activity. They take issue, instead, with the means that Congress chose to regulate this economic activity. Plaintiffs urge that the correct way to ensure that people pay for the medical services they consume is not by imposing an insurance requirement, but by "imposing restrictions or penalties on individuals who attempt to consume health care services without insurance." ... Congress did not exceed its commerce power by opting to require minimum insurance coverage or the payment of a tax, instead of conditioning access to health care on the purchase of insurance and thereby denying the sick and injured access to medical care if they do not have coverage. Plaintiffs' proposed regulatory scheme disregards both the essential characteristics of the health care services market and the nature of insurance. Because the need for health care is unpredictable, plaintiffs' approach would require that individuals obtain insurance or else risk being left on the street after a car accident. Thus, under plaintiffs' scheme, the penalty for failing to maintain minimum coverage&#8212;denial of treatment&#8212;would be far more draconian than the tax penalty that Congress enacted.</blockquote>In January, Judge Roger Vinson of the <a href = "http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">voided</a> [JURIST report] the PPACA, saying that requiring all Americans over the age of 18 to have health insurance exceeded the power of Congress under the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The DOJ filed an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/doj-appeals-florida-health-care-ruling.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] in March.

<p>Court challenges to the PPACA continue across the nation. Earlier this week, the <a href = "http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] sought <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/aclj-appeals-dismissal-of-health-care-reform-lawsuit.php">reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] of its dismissed lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the health care reform law. In April, the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-rejects-virginias-petition-for-expedited-review-of-health-care-law.php">US Supreme Court denied</a> [JURIST report] Virginia's request for the court to rule on the constitutionality of the health care reform law on an expedited basis.

Guards found the 37-year-old Inayatullah not breathing and unresponsive in his cell. They immediately began rescue treatments and summoned emergency medical personnel, but they were unable to revive him. The remains are being treated in a culturally respectful way, but an autopsy is planned. The Navy is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jOZPT3ueuQh4gGL8pPu7c69v2kOA?docId=27a94c574bbc4371b8cc22102250c376">not immediately disclosing</a> [AP report] details of the death or in which section of Guantanamo Inayatullah was being held. The death is still being investigated by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. Inayatullah was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/afghan-al-qaeda-detainee-transferred-to.php">transferred to Guantanamo</a> [JURIST report] in 2007. The Department of Defense (DOD) said that he admitted to being the head of al Qaeda operations in Zahedan, Iran, and to orchestrating al Qaeda terrorist attacks.

<p>Numerous deaths and apparent suicides at Guantanamo have fueled critics arguing for the shut down of the controversial detention facility. In February, the Center for Constitutional Rights said the death of Guantanamo detainee Awal Gul, from a heart attack, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-claims-guantanamo-detainee-death-shows-failure-of-detention-system.php">highlighted the problems</a> [JURIST report] with the facility. Gul had been detained at Guantanamo since October 2002. In January, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">criticized President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] for failing to shut down the facility as he promised during the 2008 presidential campaign. In May 2008, detainee <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=qahtani">Mohammad al-Qahtani</a> [JURIST news archive], a Saudi Arabian citizen known as the "20th hijacker" for his alleged role in 9/11, attempted suicide after he was reportedly upset about the charges the DOD brought against him. In June 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-three-guantanamo.php">three detainees died</a> [JURIST report] in apparent suicides. In 2005, American lawyer <a href="http://www.dorsey.com/attorneys/bio.aspx?FlashNavID=attorneys_search&bioid=66729903">Joshua Colangelo-Bryan</a> [professional profile] representing six Bahraini men who were being held without charges, said he witnessed an attempted suicide, which he argued was a sign of the desperation of the detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, which was dismissed by the <a href = "http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for  the Northern District of California</a> [official website] in 2005 due to a lack of jurisdiction, alleges that Mercedes-Benz Argentina "collaborated with state security forces to kidnap, detain, torture, and kill the plaintiffs and/or their relatives." The plaintiffs seek damages under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">alien tort statute</a> [text] and the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victims Protection Act of 1991</A> [text]. The initial judgment stated that the case should be brought in Argentina or Germany, Daimler AG's place of incorporation. In the opinion, Judge Reinhardt rejected this and stated the US has jurisdiction over the claims:<blockquote>The reality is that in an increasingly complex and globalized economy, international corporations such as DCAG reap enormous profits from the sale of their goods in the United States. The sales are achieved through the use of major distributors, frequently in the form of subsidiaries. Many international companies organize their corporate structure and establish subsidiaries for the sole purpose of obtaining the maximum benefit from the American market. To the ordinary American, and certainly to us, it would seem odd, indeed, if the manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, which are sold in California in vast numbers by its American subsidiary, for use on the state's streets and highways, could not be required to appear in the federal courts of that state.</blockquote>He also determined that neither Argentina nor Germany would be fully adequate forums to address the suit. Daimler AG <a href = "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Daimler-must-face-Argentina-rb-3071935352.html?x=0">intends to appeal the decision</a> [Reuters report] and denies all charges stemming from the original lawsuit.

<p>Argentina continues to prosecute those accused of committing human rights abuses during the Dirty War. Earlier this week, eight former Argentine military officers were <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/argentina-officers-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-dirty-war-massacre.php">convicted for the massacre of Margarita Belen</a> [JURIST report]. An Argentine federal court in April <A href = "/paperchase/2011/04/argentina-ex-general-sentenced-to-life-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former general Eduardo Cabanillas to life in prison for his involvement in the Dirty War. Former general Luciano Benjamin Menendez, already serving a life sentence, was sentenced to an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/argentina-court-gives-ex-general-additional-life-sentence-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">additional life sentence</a> [JURIST report] in March for the attack and murder of five urban guerrilla group members. Also in March, an Argentine court commenced the trial of former dictators <a href = "http://www.trial-ch.org/index.php?id=801&L=5&tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=jorge-rafael_videla_151&cHash=0bcbee03a1">Jorge Videla</a> [Trial Watch profile; JURIST <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Jorge+Videla">news archive</a>] and <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Reynaldo+Bignone">Reynaldo Bignone</a> [JURIST news archive] for allegedly overseeing a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/argentina-court-begins-trial-over-dirty-war-baby-thefts.php">systematic plan to steal babies</a> [JURIST report] born to political prisoners. In December, Videla was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/argentina-ex-dictator-sentenced-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity.

AI argues that Egypt must do more to deal with the victims of human rights violations the organization claims were perpetrated by Egypt's security forces. The report argues that the new Egyptian government should take three broad steps to remedying the violations: Egypt should "conduct full, impartial and independent investigations into all cases of human rights violations which took place during the unrest," provide financial compensation to those who suffered human rights violations, and "undertake a fundamental overhaul of all the security and law enforcement bodies, and make public a clear structure of the various security branches with a clear chain of command and full accountability under the law."

<p>Earlier this month, former Egyptian interior minister Habib el-Adly was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/former-egypt-interior-minister-convicted-on-corruption-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on charges of corruption and money laundering and sentenced to 12 years in prison. He is also set to face a separate trial this Saturday over his involvement in the killing of protesters. Mubarak is also <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/mubarak-could-face-death-penalty-for-protester-killings.php">facing charges</a> [JURIST report] over the killings of protesters and could face the death penalty if convicted. He also <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2011/1043/eg1.htm">faces charges</a> [<em>Ahram</em> report] of corruption and embezzlement of public funds. Zakaria Shalash, head judge of the Cairo Court of Appeals, said this month that Mubarak <a href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2011/1044/eg5.htm">may face execution</a> [<em>Ahram</em> report] and that Adly's testimony could help prove Mubarak was an accomplice to the killings. In February, AI reported new evidence that the Supreme Military Council of Egypt had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-alleges-new-evidence-of-detainee-abuse-by-egypt-military.php">torturing protester-detainees</a> [JURIST report]. Through various detainee accounts, AI stated that individuals were tortured "to intimidate protesters and to obtain information about plans for the protests." Also in February, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that the Egyptian military was improperly detaining protesters and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">allowing prisoner abuse</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Six <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">opposition leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] in March after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href = "http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in the capital of Manana. Many protesters are calling for the removal of the royal family, which has been in power since the 18th century. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] urged the government of Bahrain to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters.

The letter, sent to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, praised the parliament's passage of amendments to its <a href="http://www.internationallawbureau.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/The-International-Crimes-Tribunals-Act-1973.pdf">International Crimes (Tribunals) Act of 1973</a> (ICA) [text, PDF], including instituting civilian judges rather than military judges and mandating independence for the tribunal's judicial functions. However, HRW says, "that additional amendments to the Act and Rules are necessary to ensure that trials are carried out in accordance with Bangladesh's international human rights obligations, international criminal law, and Bangladesh's constitution." HRW says the act was in accordance with international standards at the time but needs to be updated to be more like other international criminal tribunals around the world such as International Criminal Tribunals for the former <a href="http://www.icty.org/">Yugoslavia</a> and <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">Rwanda</a> and the <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a> [official websites].

The petition raises questions over whether the tribunal can prosecute any persons or only military personnel and over who may serve on the Supreme Court. In July 2010, the Bangladesh ICT <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-issues-arrest-warrants-for-islamist-leaders.php">issued four arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for the leaders of the Islamist group <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm">Jamaat e Islami</a> for crimes committed during <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-pak_1971.htm">1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounders].

Kepiro was convicted both in 1944 and 1946 and sentenced to 10 years for involvement in the raids, but he was released and fled to Argentina.

The court held the NRC did not abuse its discretion in renewing the license for another 10 years for the 40-year-old New Jersey plant. The <a href="http://www.cleanwateraction.org/njef/">New Jersey Environmental Federation</a> (NJEF) [advocacy website] challenged the NRC procedures used to approve the renewal, seeking to force the NRC to reconsider the decision to renew the license. NJEF argues there is corrosion of the steel containment unit that encloses the reactor vessel may be causing radiation to leak into the Oyster Creek. The plant's owner, <a href="http://www.exeloncorp.com/Pages/home.aspx">Exelon</a> [corporate website], produced evidence that it had sufficiently protected against leakage and agreed to shut down the plant in 10 years. The court, on an abuse of discretion standard, found that NJEF did not meet its burden to reopen the record and refused to interfere with the agencies expertise:<blockquote>We commend Citizens for their diligence in bringing these issues to the attention of the Board and the NRC. We also recognize that the Board and the NRC provided hundreds of pages detailing their decision making and gave due consideration to Citizens' concerns. We are confident that the NRC's review of Exelon's application was well-reasoned, and we will not second-guess technical decisions within the realm of its unique expertise.</blockquote>The court also asked that the NRC, Exelon and NJEF comment on how the disaster in Japan causing a meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station should impact the Oyster Creek. The court concluded based on the NRC's determination that the containment was adequate that the events in Japan did not support granting the NJEF's petition. 
 
In April, Tamar Cerafici of the Cerafici Law Firm <a href="/forum/2011/04/fukushima-illustrates-need-for-policy.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the nuclear crisis in Japan highlights the need for an international response with clear, measured leadership from the US, saying that leadership is hollow unless the US adopts a coherent energy policy paying more than a begrudging acceptance of nuclear power. Last July, three administrative law judges with the NRC <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/aslbpfuncdesc.html">Atomic Safety and Licensing Board</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/judges-rule-obama-cannot-close-yucca-waste-site-without-congressional-approval.php">denied a request</a> [JURIST report] by the Obama administration and the US <a href="http://www.energy.gov/index.htm">Department of Energy</a> (DOE) [official website] to withdraw the government's application for a license to construct a permanent <a href="http://esd.lbl.gov/research/programs/new/research_areas/yucca_mountain/">nuclear waste repository</a> [Berkeley Lab backgrounder] in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the application in March 2010 claiming that Yucca Mountain is not a "workable option" for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste and that "alternatives will better serve the public interest."]]></content:encoded>

The deadline for implementation was January 1, but Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have yet to implement any measures of the directive, and Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Sweden have only partially implemented the directives.<blockquote>The Directive in question amends the Capital Requirements Directives (2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC). The aim of these Directives is to ensure the financial soundness of banks and investment firms. Together they stipulate how much of their own financial resources banks and investment firms must have in order to cover their risks and protect their depositors.</blockquote>Later that day, <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-19/sweden-vows-to-implement-eu-bank-capital-rules-to-avert-lawsuit.html">Sweden promised</a> [Bloomberg report] to implement the EC's recommendations.

Greece, Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia are all drafting legislation on the topic. Italy, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg did not comment. Greece, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have two months to explain how they will implement the new regulations.

<p>Principal changes include remuneration policies and practices within banks, capital requirements for resecuritisations, disclosure of securitisation exposures and capital requirements for the trading book. Specifically, the law restricts payments of "bank bonuses" and forces banks to disclose employees earning more than one million euro. The law, which has only been partially implemented in Belgium, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Sweden, concerns a requirement that banks have a certain amount of capital on hand at all times. The EC is responsible for ensuring <a href = "http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] law is applied throughout all member states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the letter, the groups outline "grave concerns" that the highly classified nature of <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/286">Case 3</a> and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/98">Case 4</a> [materials] betrays a lack of "genuine" effort to bring the former members of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22Khmer+Rouge%22">news archives</a>] to justice and implicates that the "impartiality, integrity and ... independence of ECCC judges are being tainted." The accusation comes amid mounting speculation that Cambodian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] has exerted undue influence over the court's proceedings. Hun has <a href="http://www.cambodiatribunal.org/images/CTM/hrw%20bashes%20hun%20sen%20on%20eccc%20stance%207-24-09.pdf">drawn criticism</a> [<em>Phnom Penh Post</em> report] from rights groups and the international community for his public and at-times <a href="http://www.irrawaddymedia.com/article.php?art_id=16738&Submit=Submit">vehement opposition</a> [AP report] to the continued work of the ECCC. The court further stoked suspicion Wednesday when it <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/documents/courtdoc/D14_EN.PDF">ordered</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eccc-judges-order-prosecutor-to-retract-statement-demanding-further-investigation-into-khmer-rouge-s.php">report</a>] international co-prosecutor Andrew Cayley to recant statements he made earlier this month in a <a href="http://cambodiatribunal.org/images/CTM/eccc%20int-ocp%209%20may%202011%20eng.pdf">public brief</a> [text, PDF] on the facts of Case 3. According to the court, the co-prosecutor lacked a "legal basis" for issuing statements about "crimes required to be judicially investigated" and violated the confidentiality provisions of the <a href="http://www.dccam.org/Tribunal/Documents/ECCC_IRs_English1.pdf">Internal Rules of the ECCC</a> [text, PDF]. The groups' letter emphasized the Cambodian people's right to know such information:<blockquote>One of the functions being fulfilled by the ECCC is to create an historical record about what happened. It is imperative that this record is as complete and accurate as possible. ... The Cambodians have a right to justice. ... In order to effectively exercise this right, all Cambodians need access to publicly available information. Ample information can be provided to victims while safeguarding the rights of those alleged to have perpetrated Khmer Rouge atrocities according to the highest international standards.</blockquote>The groups said that they are "concerned that the mandate of the court ... is at risk of not being genuinely carried out" and emphasized that ECCC judges should be "prohibited from accepting or seeking any instructions from any government[.]"

<p>Last October, Hun Sen informed UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] in a meeting that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/cambodia-pm-rejects-further-prosecution-of-khmer-rouge-officials-by-un-tribunal.php">government will not allow</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution of low-ranking Khmer Rouge officers by the ECCC. Earlier this week in <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/2">ECCC Case 2</a> [materials], a panel of judges <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/ex-khmer-rouge-minister-denied-pre-trial-release.php">denied a motion for pretrial release</a> [JURIST report] by former Khmer Rouge official <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/indicted-person/ieng-sary">Ieng Sary</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ieng+Sary">news archive</a>]. Ieng, 85, served as deputy foreign minister under the Khmer Rouge regime during its reign in Cambodia from 1975-1979. Citing the ECCC rules and the Cambodian rules of criminal procedure, he argued that the court had no authority to detain a prisoner for more than three years without certain substantive rulings, making his detention illegal since November 2010. Ieng's co-defendants <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/nuon-chea">Nuon Chea</a>, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/khieu-samphan">Khieu Samphan</a> and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-person/ieng-thirith">Ieng Thirith</a> [ECCC backgrounders] have all challenged pretrial custody unsuccessfully. In March, <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-personpage/kaing-guek-eav">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">news archive</a>], a former prison chief at the notorious Toul Sleng prison under the Khmer Rouge, better known as "Duch," <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-khmer-rouge-official-in-court-to-appeal-war-crimes-convictions.php">appealed</a> a 35-year sentence for war crimes and crimes against humanity <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">handed down by the ECCC</a> [JURIST reports] last July. The conviction was the court's first since its founding in 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While in the House, <a href = "http://www.projo.com/news/content/CIVIL_UNIONS_VOTE_05-20-11_KSO6A4T_v106.33afe36.html">several amendments failed</a> [<em>Providence Journal</em> report], including one to convert the bill to a <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=%22same-sex+marriage%22">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] bill, and another to clarify that marriage is reserved for opposite-sex couples. Another failed amendment would have put the decision to voters in a referendum. The bill is now sent to the Senate, where its <a href = "http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/ri-house-endorses-civil-951275.html">passage is uncertain</a> [AP report]. <a href = "http://www.governor.ri.gov/">Governor Lincoln Chafee</a> [official website] is expected to sign the bill but has <a href = "http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wrni/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1795388/news/Civil.Union.bill.disappoints.Chafee">expressed disappointment</a> [NPR report] that it is limited to civil unions rather than same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>Same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial and divisive issue through the US, although a recent <a href = "http://people-press.org/2011/03/03/fewer-are-angry-at-government-but-discontent-remains-high/">poll</a> [materials] suggests support for legalization is growing. The <a href = "http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/">Minnesota Senate</a> [official website] earlier this month <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-senate-approves-referendum-on-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">approved a voter referendum</a> [JURIST report] to amend the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Last month, a Montana judge <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that had called for the state to provide legal status to same-sex relationships. Also in April, the <A href = "http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the state constitution that would ban same-sex marriage or any "substantially similar" status, and the <A href = "http://legisweb.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Senate</a> [official website] in February approved a bill that would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">void in Wyoming any same-sex marriages and civil unions</a> [JURIST report] performed in other jurisdictions.

Koh referenced a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/state-department-legal-adviser-defends.php">speech he made</a> [JURIST report] in March 2010 defending the use of predator drones to kill US targets where he argued that al Qaeda is an imminent threat to the US, giving the US authority to defend itself using lethal force, which means targeting high-level al Qaeda leaders. Koh explained that the Obama administration is dedicated to the principles of distinction, meaning limiting attacks to military objectives, and proportionality, meaning limiting the death of civilians and damage to civilian property. In his recent statement, Koh said that materials collected during the Bin Laden raid confirm suspicions that Bin Laden remained an imminent threat to the US and its citizens and that his failure to submit to an appropriate surrender authorized the troops use of lethal force:<blockquote>[T]he manner in which the U.S. operation was conducted&#8212;taking great pains both to distinguish between legitimate military objectives and civilians and to avoid excessive incidental injury to the latter&#8212;followed the principles of distinction and proportionality described above, and was designed specifically to preserve those principles, even if it meant putting U.S. forces in harm's way. Finally, consistent with the laws of armed conflict and U.S. military doctrine, the U.S. forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had surrendered in a way that they could safely accept. The laws of armed conflict require acceptance of a genuine offer of surrender that is clearly communicated by the surrendering party and received by the opposing force, under circumstances where it is feasible for the opposing force to accept that offer of surrender. But where that is not the case, those laws authorize use of lethal force against an enemy belligerent, under the circumstances presented here.</blockquote> Former US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens also recently commented on the killing of Bin Laden during remarks at Northwestern University, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/13/scotus.stevens.bin.laden/index.html?iref=allsearch">saying the killing was legally justified</a> [CNN report] and that he was proud of the US Navy SEALs who carried out the mission. 

<p>Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] said the killing of Bin Laden was lawful and justified. Testifying before the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website], Holder said that the shooting of Bin Laden was "consistent with our values," and that the soldiers who killed him "conducted themselves totally appropriately." Some do not agree. <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a>, professor of law at Webster University and Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, both in Geneva, Switzerland, <a href="/forum/2011/05/curtis-doebbler-illegal-killing-obl.php">argues the killing violated international law</a> [JURIST op-ed] because it was a targeted killing carried out within Pakistan without the country's permission and because it was an "extrajudicial executions that violate the right to life."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law was criticized because, while allowing for prosecutions of veterans of the war, it did not allow for prosecution of rebel guerrillas also involved. The <a href = "http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?&CFID=666614&CFTOKEN=69520161">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website, in Spanish] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/human-rights-court-invalidates-uruguay-military-amnesty-law.php">effectively overturned the law</a> [JURIST report] last month when it <a href = "http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=15848">ruled</a> [judgment, in Spanish] that Uruguay's government must bring to justice those responsible for the disappearance of a woman abducted by Uruguay government forces in 1976. In November, the <a href = "http://www.poderjudicial.gub.uy/servlet/page?_pageid=56&_dad=portal30&_schema=PORTAL30&_type=site&_fsiteid=34&_fid=4550&_fnavbarid=1&_fnavbarsiteid=34&_fedit=0&_fmode=2&_fdisplaymode=1&_fcalledfrom=1&_fdisplayurl=">Uruguayan Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/uruguay-high-court-annuls-dictatorship-amnesty.php">found the law to be unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Prior to November's judgment, Uruguay's Supreme Court had largely upheld the amnesty <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-high-court-overturns-amnesty.php">except in extreme circumstances</a>, and in 2009 a popular vote <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-voters-reject-referendum-to-end.php">failed to overturn the law</a> [JURIST reports]. Many of the alleged kidnappings and deaths occurred in connection with <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3720724.stm">Operation Condor</a> [BBC backgrounder], a cooperative effort between the governments of Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Chile to eliminate left-wing political opponents. In June, ex-military officials in Argentina were <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/argentina-ex-military-officials-go-on-trial-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for the deaths of 65 activists in connection with Operation Condor. The Uruguayan government has also attempted to bring those responsible for the disappearance of leftist activist to justice. In 2006, eight former police and military officers were <a href = "/paperchase/2006/09/uruguay-indicts-8-for-operation-condor.php">indicted by a Uruguayan court</a> [JURIST report] on counts of kidnapping and conspiracy committed during the 1973-1985 dictatorship. The crimes were related to the 1976 disappearances of five members of an Uruguayan leftist group who fled to Argentina and were detained there by police, and who investigators suspect were victims of Operation Condor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?682648548">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website] is challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate which requires that all citizens purchase health insurance. The court asked the TMLC to file a 10-page brief addressing standing concerns and whether it is bringing a facial or as applied challenge to the health care law. The court wants TMLC to explain its injury in fact, having filed the challenge three years prior to the effective date of the health care and to explain what enforcement mechanisms the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) [official website] can even use to force compliance. It also wants to know if TMLC is bringing a facial challenge, because, if so, there is a higher standard they must meet. TMLC filed the appeal in December after a federal district court <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the health care law's constitutionality.

<p>The constitutionality of the individual mandate is a source of controversy and has spawned multiple lawsuits. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] sought to have its challenge reinstated in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] after it was dismissed by the lower court. Last February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked federal judge Roger Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">clarify that states must continue to enact the health care reform law</a> as the government appeals from Vinson's January ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">finding the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. There is also an ongoing challenge in Virginia over a split decision in the US district courts with the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against individual mandate provision</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Senate Majority Leader <a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Harry Reid</a> (D-NV) with Senate Minority Leader <a href="http://mcconnell.senate.gov/public/">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-KY) and House Speaker <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/News/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official websites] <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/leaders-forge-deal-on-four-year-extension-of-patriot-act-provisions/2011/05/19/AFpu2M7G_blog.html?wprss=2chambers">agreed to extend</a> [WP report] several key provisions of the Act with no amendments and will first put it to floor debate in the House next Monday, where it could reach a final vote by the following Wednesday. Controversial provisions to be renewed include provisions allowing the government to use roving wiretaps on multiple carriers and electronic devices and allowing the government to gain access to certain records relevant to its investigations. The "lone wolf" provision enables investigators to get warrants to conduct surveillance over targets not connected to any particular terrorist group. It is unclear whether House Minority Leader <a href="http://pelosi.house.gov/">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA) [official website] agrees with the extension.

<p>Last February, the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/house-passes-short-term-patriot-act-extension.php">passed a short-term extension</a> [JURIST report] until May 27 of the controversial surveillance provisions after they were set to expire on February 28, two days after the US <a href="http://senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/senate-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the bill by an 86-12 vote. Earlier that week, a simple majority of the House <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/house-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">approved a similar bill</a> that would have extended the three provisions until December after it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/patriot-act-extension-fails-in-house.php">failed</a> [JURIST reports] the prior week under a special rule that required a two-thirds majority. Prior to that vote, the Obama administration released a <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USEOPWHPO/2011/02/08/file_attachments/16366/SAP_on_H.R._514.pdf">statement of administration policy</a> [text, PDF] vying for a three-year renewal of the provisions. The provisions were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">extended in February 2010</a> after the Obama administration asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">extend</a> [JURIST reports] the Patriot Act. </p>]]></content:encoded>

General Lo Hsien-che <A HREF = "http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aIPL&ID=201105200027">confessed</a> [CNA report] to accepting bribes and divulging state secrets since March 2004. Due to his confession and relinquishment of bribes, the prosecutors plan to <a href = "http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/05/21/2003503759">seek life in prison</a> [<em>Taipei Times</em> report] rather than the death penaltyTa. Lo was the head of communications and electronic information at Army Command Headquarters, and there are fears that his espionage has compromised the US-Taiwan Po Sheng communications project, as well as Taiwan's weapons trade with the US. China allegedly lured Lo into committing espionage by having a Chinese female agent offer him sex and money.

<p>Taiwan has had increasing difficulties with corruption. In November 2010, the Taiwan Supreme Prosecutors Office <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/taiwan-judicial-officials-indicted-on-bribery-corruption-charges.php">indicted 13 people</a> [JURIST report], including three High Court judges, on charges of bribery, corruption and money laundering.

The law requires doctors to conduct a ultrasound and display the images at least 24 hours prior to an abortion, and would strip them of their medical licenses should they fail to do so. The law also requires doctors to provide "a simultaneous verbal explanation of the results of the live, real-time sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of arms, legs, external members, and internal organs." The law contains exceptions from the requirements under certain circumstances, including rape, incest or fetal abnormalities. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">Texas House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/texas-house-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-before-abortions.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in March. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/">Missouri House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a bill prohibiting late-term abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Last month, Kansas <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Governor Sam Brownback</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">announced the signing</a> [JURIST report] of two pieces of legislation restricting abortions in the state. One bill requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed. The other, the "fetal pain bill", restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation. Earlier in April, the <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/">Idaho legislature</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">gave final approval</a> [JURIST report] to a bill that would prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. </p>

<p><strong>Correction</strong>: The original text of this story said that the Texas law required "vaginal sonograms" before an abortion can be performed. The text of the law does not explicitly require vaginal sonograms. However, in many cases it will be necessary to <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20110520-texas-new-sonogram-law-to-face-suit-rights-group-says.ece">administer the sonograms through a vaginal probe</a> [<em>The Dallas Morning News</em> report].

The two remaining presidential candidates who were awaiting trial, Mikalay Statkevich and Dzmitry Vus, were also supposed to be given sentences Friday, but sentencing has been postponed indefinitely. Another candidate was <A href = "/paperchase/2011/01/belarus-releases-7-detainees-including-presidential-candidate.php">released in January</a> [JURIST report], and the seventh has fled Belarus to seek asylum in the Czech Republic. All of the <a href = "http://www.belhelcom.org/en/node/13077">detained protesters</a> [Belarusian Helsinki Committee] are accused of violating Article 293 of the Criminal Code of Belarus for inciting and participating in riots. Nyaklyaeu attributed his shortened sentence to the support with protesters of the US and the EU. The EU is set to implement travel bans and asset-freezes on Lukashenko next week, and is reportedly considering further sanctions.

<p><A href = "/paperchase/2006/03/belarus-slammed-for-rights-abuses-in.php">Hundreds of activists were arrested</a> after protesting Lukashenko's 2006 presidential win, including <A href = "/paperchase/2006/04/belarus-opposition-leader-jailed.php">opposition candidate Alexander Milinkevich</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontchirac.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The French <a href="http://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in French], the country's highest appeals court, ruled that the corruption trial against former French president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12666433">Jacques Chirac</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chirac">news archive</a>] can continue, rejecting a constitutional challenge brought by one of his co-defendants. Chirac is being tried for allegedly misusing funds during his time as Paris mayor in 1990. Chirac's co-defendant, Remy Chardon, his former chief of staff, challenged a decision by the prosecution to dismiss the statute of limitations in the case against Chardon violates the French Constitution. The court however found the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13475114">claims were not valid</a> [BBC report] and did not need to go to the <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/homepage.14.html">Constitutional Council</a> [official website], France's highest constitutional authority. The challenge has postponed the trial since March in only its second day. 

<p>The trial began despite the fact that the main plaintiff dropped out of the suit. Last September, the Paris city council <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-ex-president-chirac-settles-with-paris-in-corruption-case.php">accepted a settlement deal</a> [JURIST report] in which the former president agreed to pay USD $741,000 in compensation for the money paid out for false jobs. In exchange, the city agreed to drop out of the corruption suit. Chirac stated that the settlement was not an admission of guilt. A French judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/france-judge-orders-probe-of-chirac.php">placed Chirac under preliminary investigation</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. Chirac's trial on corruption charges <a href="/hotline/2009/12/jacques-chiracs-trial-on-corruption.php">marks the first time</a> [JURIST comment] a former president will have to answer to charges against him in a court of law. The trial is a combination of two separate corruption-related cases, in which Chirac allegedly financed the Rally for the Republic (RPR), now renamed as the <a href="http://www.lemouvementpopulaire.fr/">Union for a Popular Movement</a> [party website, in French], by illegally establishing fake city positions between 1977 and 1995 for party members to collect salaries totaling several million dollars. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The two claims against Iran were brought on behalf of <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv0520-19">Seth Haim</a> and <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv1807-32">Alan Beer</a> [opinions, PDF], who were both killed in Israel by suicide bombers. In the opinions by <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/lamberth">Judge Royce Lamberth</a> [official profile], the court found the the plaintiffs could be awarded damages based on an <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001605----000-.html">exception</a> [28 USC &#167; 1605A] to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) for "state-sponsored terrorism." The court said the exception creates a federal right of action against foreign states for which punitive damages may be awarded when the current foreign state was established prior to sponsoring of terrorism, the victim was an employee of the US government acting within the scope of employment, and where the claimant has given the foreign state against whom the action is brought a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate the claim. Lamberth concluded in the <span class="casename">Beer</span> case that the court "expresses hope that the sanction it issues today will play a measurable role in changing the conduct of Iran&#8212;and other supporters of international terrorism&#8212;in the future." 

<p>Iran has been the target of suits by US citizens seeking damages for deaths as a result of Iranian-backed terrorist groups. In February 2010, 85 victims of rocket attacks in Israel <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/israeli-hezbollah-rocket-victims-sue.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in DC District Court seeking damages from Iran and Iran's central bank for injuries suffered in the 2006 Second Lebanon War. The suit claims that Iran, between 2001 and 2006, gave <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> [JURIST news archive] more than $50 million "with the specific intent and purpose of facilitating, enabling and causing Hezbollah to carry out terrorist attacks against American and Israeli targets in order to advance Iran's Policy and Goals" of undermining the US and abolishing Israel. In 2009, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-decides-iran-compensation.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-615">Ministry of Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran v. Elahi</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-hears-epa-iran.php">report</a>] that the brother of dissident Cyrus Elahi, assassinated in Paris in 1990, cannot collect on a default judgment he holds against Iran by attaching a $2.8 million judgment obtained by the Iranian Ministry of Defense against California-based <A HREF="http://www.cubic.com/">Cubic Defense Systems</A> [corporate website]. Dariush Elahi was awarded $11.7 million in compensatory and $300 million in punitive damages after Iran refused to respond to his 2000 lawsuit brought in a Washington federal court, alleging that the Iranian government was responsible for his brother's death.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Included in the affidavits, but under seal from the judge, are the testimonies of Iranian defectors who worked for Iran's intelligence service, declaring that Iran helped plan the attacks through <A href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4314423.stm">Hezbollah</a> [BBC Backgrounder], as well as facilitated the escapes of al Qaeda operatives after the attack. The affidavits also include depositions of 9/11 Commission workers who believe Iran helped to orchestrate the account:<blockquote>Havlish experts specifically conclude that the evidence is clear and convincing that Iran materially supported al Qaeda. Although each of the Havlish experts' affidavits speaks for itself, two passages fairly summarize their views: It is our expert opinion to a reasonable degree of professional certainty that the Iranian Regime's use of terror and, specifically, its material support of al Qaeda in multiple terrorist attacks, including 9/11, is beyond question.</blockquote>The <A href = "www.september11classaction.com/Publication_Complete_Document.pdf">initial suit</a> [text, PDF], <a href = "http://www.iran911case.com/">Havlish v. Bin Laden</a> [materials] was filed in 2002. Plaintiffs seek a default judgment since Iran has not mounted a defense, and $100 billion in damages, but have stated that their principal focus is the US admitting Iran's involvement and mounting further investigations to that effect.

<p>Previous attempts to indict other nations in the 9/11 attacks through litigation have failed. Two years ago, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href = "/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-dismisses-911-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by survivors of the 9/11 attacks against the nation of Saudi Arabia and four of its princes, ruling that the defendants were protected from prosecution under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> [text]. The appeals court upheld a 2005 <a href = "/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs in that case were suing more than 200 defendants who allegedly helped fund and support Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda. Casey allowed a claim to proceed against the <A href = "http://www.sbg.com.sa/">Saudi Binladen Group</a> [corporate website], the successor to a construction company founded by Bin Laden's father, because additional discovery is necessary to determine whether the company "purposefully directed its activities at the United States." This is the first such suit against Iran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In August, piracy charges against six defendants were <A href = "/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute.

Medvedev is trying to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/20/russia-medvedev-idUSLDE74J0SM20110520">separate himself</a> [Reuters report] from <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] who is running against him in the March 2012 presidential election. Medvedev said that during his time in office he has tried to root out the corruption that has plagued Russian politics. But he said that in order for real legal reform there must be a strong judicial system. He said:<blockquote>Even the best possible laws on paper can prove ineffective in practice and remain no more than declarations if we do not have courts that work, or if we have excessive or overly lax administrative procedures. Sadly, we know this all too well from our own experience. Problems with enforcing laws, lack of respect for the courts, and corruption are not just issues affecting our public life, but are macroeconomic factors holding back our national wealth growth and putting a brake on our efforts to carry out economic decisions and social initiatives. The quality and competitiveness of legal institutions therefore play a vital part for assuring all countries' future, the Russian Federation's too.</blockquote> Russia media and banking tycoon Alexander Lebedev on Thursday <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13472435">threw his support</a> [BBC report] behind Putin joining Putin's an anti-corruption coalition.

<p>In December 2008, Medvedev's first year in office, he proposed that Russian courts become more transparent in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website]. Speaking at the seventh All-Russian Congress of Judges, Medvedev said that the ECHR cannot and should not replace Russian courts. Russia is the source of more applications to the ECHR than any other country. Medvedev proposed measures to improve the quality of judges and provide broader access to court documents. He encouraged the congress to discuss his concerns and make concrete proposals. In June 2008, Medvedev said he was committed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-president-pledges-support-for.php">improving Russia's human rights record</a> and enforcing the rule of law, reiterating pledges he made at his <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/incoming-russia-president-stresses.php">May inauguration</a> [JURIST reports]. Medvedev, himself a lawyer by training, promised top legal officials he would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/russia-president-vows-reforms-to-rid.php">tackle corruption and intimidation in the Russian judicial system</a> [JURIST report], calling for reforms to better train and support judges. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2004, two military contractors assisting the US in Iraq, Olin Armstrong and Jack Hensley, were kidnapped, held hostage, and ultimately decapitated by <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zarqawi">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> [JURIST news archive], videos of which were circulated on the internet. The contractors' estates filed suit under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sup_01_28_10_IV_20_97.html">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976</a> (FSIA) [28 USC &#167;&#167; 1330, 1602 <em>et seq.</em>], claiming Syrian officials <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/20/syria.judgment.upheld/">provided material support</a> [CNN report] for the murders in the form of "advice or assistance." The appeals court decided two procedural issues in favor of the estates of the two contractors, holding that the court had jurisdiction and that the families adequately effected service of process against Syria when they first filed suit. Syria made a number of other challenges to the district court's default judgment order rendered against the country, but the court upheld the ruling, finding that none of Syria's constitutional, procedural, or jurisdictional challenges to the default judgment had merit.

<p>US citizens have brought similar suits against foreign nations under the FSIA. On Thursday, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-grants-punitive-damages-against-iran-for-suicide-bombings.php">granted $300 million in punitive damages</a> [JURIST report] in each of two cases against Iran for deaths resulting from suicide bombings by Iranian-backed terrorist groups. The court found that the plaintiffs could be awarded damages based on the exception to the FSIA for "state-sponsored terrorism." Other attempts to litigate pursuant to FSIA have failed, however. In 2009, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-dismisses-911-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought by survivors of the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] against the nation of Saudi Arabia and four of its princes, ruling that the defendants were protected from prosecution under the FSIA. The ruling upheld a 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo, who told reporters in early April that <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icc-prosecutor-urges-probe-into-recent-ivory-coast-violence.php">he was willing to investigate the alleged war crimes</a> [JURIST report], indicated that he had a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the court had been committed on the Ivory Coast since November 2010. Despite the Ivory Coast not being a party to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text], the ICC press release stated that the country had affirmed the jurisdiction of the court on several occasions. The <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE74J5DN20110520?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FAFRICAWorldNews+%28News+%2F+AFRICA+%2F+World+News%29">formal investigation will likely focus</a> [Reuters report] on former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile], who refused to cede power following the November 28 election, as well as current, democratically elected <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile].

<p>In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Ouattara to investigate "atrocities," including murder and rape, committed by opposing political forces during the recent conflicts. Earlier in April, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence that took place. Last month, the OHCHR called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">independent investigation into post-election violence</a> [JURIST report]. The violence stemmed from Gbagbo's refusal to cede power to Ouattara, who won the November 2010 runoff election according to international observers. Gbagbo was elected president in 2000 to serve a five-year term, but he has maintained his office, delaying six successive elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court reduced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">death sentences</a> [JURIST report] of two others to life in prison. The four men were tried in the special appeals security court set up by Royal Decree in March, under emergency law, during the Shiite-led protests in Bahrain. The special court and other measure implemented under emergency law have been heavily criticized by various human rights groups. Nabeel Rajab, leader of the <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en">Bahrain Center for Human Rights </a> [advocacy website] criticized the ruling, expressing his concern that the cases are politically motivated and an attempt for the government to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/22/us-bahrain-verdict-idUSTRE74L0IO20110522">stop protests</a> [Reuters report]. The date for the two executions has not yet been disclosed but would first require the approval of Bahrain's king. The death penalty is rarely used in Bahrain and typically not used against the country's citizens.

<p>Last week, Bahrain's Lower National Safety Court sentenced nine citizens to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-sentences-shiite-cleric-8-others-for-police-kidnapping.php">20 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for kidnapping a police officer. The decision was announced by the government-owned Bahrain News Agency, without details of the charges or the incident. Among the convicted was prominent Shiite cleric Mohammed Habib al-Saffaf. The <a href="http://byshr.org/">Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] said that all nine were <a href="http://byshr.org/?p=487">involved in previous anti-government demonstrations</a> [statement]. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has urged the government of Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/">Minnesota House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 70-62 to approve the proposed amendment. In early May, the voter referendum received <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-senate-approves-referendum-on-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">approval</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/">Minnesota Senate</a> [official website] by a vote of 38-27, with only one Democrat joining Republicans in supporting the amendment. Although Minnesota law already bans same-sex marriages, this constitutional amendment would ensure that the state court does not change this law. The proposed amendment will appear on the ballot asking voters: "shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to provide that only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in Minnesota?" Protesters on both sides of the issue gathered outside of the Minnesota House of Representatives for several days leading up to the vote. Minnesota <a href="http://mn.gov/governor/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] opposes any constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage but cannot prevent the measure from appearing on the ballot.

<p>Same-sex marriage remains a controversial issue across the US. Last month, a Montana judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that had called for the state to provide legal status to same-sex relationships. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overwhelmingly approved </a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the state constitution that would ban same-sex marriage or any "substantially similar" status, and the <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/lsoweb/">Wyoming Senate</a> [official website] in February approved a bill that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">void in Wyoming any same-sex marriages and civil unions</a> [JURIST report] performed in other jurisdictions.

South Korean forces captured five alleged pirates in a raid on a hijacked South Korean chemical freighter, the Samho Jewelry, in January in the Arabian Sea. The five alleged pirates were transferred back to South Korea where they were indicted. One pleaded guilty with the other <a href="HTTP://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2011/05/23/1/0302000000AEN20110523007700315F.HTML">four standing trial</a> [<em>Yonhap News</em> report] in the Busan District Court, which has jurisdiction over the area in which the shipping company is located. But lawyers for the alleged pirates argue that the South Korean court does not have jurisdiction to try them since they never should have been transferred back to South Korea. They argue under the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/closindx.htm">UN Convention on Law of the Sea</a> [text] and other treaties that South Korea has the authority to arrest pirates but not transfer them. The pirates will be tried by a 12-member jury which can recommend a verdict to the judges. The trial has been delayed due to translation issues but is set to last five days with the verdict on Friday. The court will also rule on the jurisdiction issue when it gives its final verdict Friday. This is the first attempt by South Korea to punish pirates. Some of the alleged pirates on trial are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggvUt2ITXT38-52w2vILpxVGYuGw?docId=CNG.1367ebc335746b886b2a856aec6f57d0.341">believed to have been a part of a group</a> [AFP report] that South Korea paid a $9 million ransom to retrieve another one of its ships.

<p>The US is also putting alleged pirates on trial in attempt to control a wave of international maritime piracy. Last week, a Somali man <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/somali-pirate-pleads-guilty-in-us-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges of piracy and hostage taking in the <a href = "http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] for overtaking a yacht containing four American citizens. The Americans, taken as hostages, were later killed by the pirates, the first US citizens to die due to the recent wave of piracy. Last month, a US district court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">sentenced a Somali pirate to 25 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in attacking a Danish ship, as well as the US Navy's USS Ashland. In November, a federal jury in Virginia <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] five Somali men on charges of piracy for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nichols. In August, piracy charges against six defendants were <A href = "/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <A href = "/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href = "paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wilder, a right-wing politician, is on trial for making anti-Islamic statements. The charges against Wilders were dismissed in 2008, but an appeals court reversed that decision. Wilders claims that one of the judges had <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gMCzMdfhehjAmFHA8rsnMO_780vw?docId=CNG.88fd56d674abda860b0428dc480c8b1d.3a1">tried to convince</a> [AFP report] the defense's expert witness to support the claims at a 2010 dinner party. He argues that the charges should be dropped because this shows bias and that it is no longer possible for him to have a fair trial. But the court found that there was not enough evidence to conclude that the judge ever tried to influence the witness. Wilders is alleged to have made inflammatory remarks against Islam. In one statement, he purportedly called the religion "fascist" and compared the Koran to Hitler's book <u>Mein Kampf</u>. While the court will allow prosecution to continue for any statements Wilders made likening Islam to Nazism, it dropped a complaint against him for referring to the Koran itself as "fascist," holding that prosecutors were precluded from including statements comparing Islam to fascism alone. Wilders maintains that his remarks were made as part of a legitimate political debate and are protected by his right to free speech. He faces up to one year in prison, but it is more likely that he will be fined if found guilty.

<p>In March, an Amsterdam court rejected Wilders' claims of improper venue, ruling that the Amsterdam court has the authority to judge the case, given that the alleged statements were committed within its jurisdiction. In February, the court granted Wilders the right to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12456693">set out the objections</a> [BBC report] he had made during the initial trial, which was postponed following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-dismisses-judges-for-bias-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">dismissal of the original panel of judges</a> [JURIST report] amidst allegations of bias. Prior to their dismissal, the original panel members heard the prosecution's case, which culminated in a request that Wilders be <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-prosecutor-requests-politicians-acquittal-for-anti-islamic-statements.php">acquitted on all charges</a> [JURIST report]. The prosecutors based their request on determinations that the politician's statements were directed at Islam and not Muslims themselves and additionally, that the evidence failed to establish that he intended to incite violence. The presentment of the prosecution's case followed an order from a panel of Dutch judges to resume the trial after initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-rejects-bias-allegations-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">rejecting claims of judicial bias</a> [JURIST report]. The trial had previously been <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-politicians-trial-suspended-soon-after-it-begins.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] after a lawyer representing Wilders accused one of the judges of making a statement which cast him in an unfavorable light to the jury.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Petitioners were charged with, and pleaded guilty to, filing, and aiding and abetting in filing, a false statement on a corporate tax return.

Plata</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-california-prison-population-reduction-order.php">report</a>] to uphold the order requiring California to release up to 46,000 prisoners to remedy the state's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+prison">overcrowded prisons</a> [JURIST news archive]. In the 5-4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court concluded that the extreme overcrowding of the California prison system is causing inmates to receive inadequate medical care in violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text]. In August 2009, a special panel of federal judges <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2009/08/04/Opinion%20&amp;%20Order%20FINAL.pdf">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judges-order-california-to.php">report</a>] California to reduce its prison population by about 46,000 inmates or construct more facilities to handle the prisoners. It is apparent that California is unable to build the prisons and will have to release the prisoners. The court found the inability of the prison system to provide the "basic sustenance" of medical care is an Eighth Amendment violation that the courts must remedy: "A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society." Kennedy also attached photographs depicting prisoners being forced to live in bunk-beds lined up in an open room and depicting small telephone-booth sized holding cells for prisoners waiting for a mental health crisis bed. The court said that the California prison system is operating at nearly 200 percent capacity. Three justices joined Justice Antonin Scalia in dissent, saying "the Court affirms what is perhaps the most radical injunction issued by a court in our Nation's history." He argued that the system-wide problems did not establish any actual individual Eighth Amendment violations and, even if there were, the injunction forcing the state to release prisoners is beyond the court's authority.

<p>The court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_11-30-10.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF] last November in this case, previously known as <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1233.pdf">Schwarzenegger v. Plata</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], over the order to release prisoners by the three-judge panel. The panel <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/judges.nsf/33fd9c0607be66f188256d480060b74b/e5a3b5c9bfe0cfbb882576a9007fbd45/$FILE/order%20to%20reduce%20prison%20population.pdf">approved</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judges-approve-california-plan.php">report</a>] a revised <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/2009_Press_Releases/docs/11-12_Filed-Stamped_Filing.pdf">prison reduction plan</a> [text, PDF] in January 2010, but action on the plan has been delayed, pending this Supreme Court appeal. Counsel for the state of California argued that the "extraordinary and unprecedented order ... requiring the release of between 36,000 and 45,000 inmates ... is extraordinarily premature." Counsel for the prisoners argued that the court must allow the lower court to provide a remedy for 20 years of overcrowding that has violated inmates' constitutional rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that when the court dismisses a valid <em>prima facie</em> affirmative defense to the government's breach of contract claim under the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=us+state+secrets">state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST news archive], the proper remedy is to leave the parties in the same position as they were in before the contract. The case is a consolidated case where <a href="http://www.generaldynamics.com/">General Dynamics</a> and <a href="http://www.boeing.com/">Boeing</a> [corporate websites] contracted with the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/swf/index.asp">Navy</a> [official website] to develop a new carrier-based stealth fighter plane, but failed to meet the terms of the agreement, prompting the government to end the contract. The companies claimed that they could not complete the work because the Navy refused to release access to secret technology about the "stealth" fighter under the state secrets doctrine. General Dynamics wanted the judgment against the Navy for $1.2 million in damages to be reinstated, while the Navy wanted General Dynamics to return $1.35 billion in progress payments for work it never approved. The court held in a unanimous opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia that the nature of the contract dealing with secret technology created a bar to judicial review of contract disputes of which the parties reasonably should have been aware. The court said, "Both parties&#8212;the Government no less than petitioners&#8212;must have assumed the risk that state secrets would prevent the adjudication of claims of inadequate performance."

<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-state-secrets-privilege-personal-jurisdiction-and-preclusion.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in this case in January. At oral arguments, counsel for the government argued that the "state-secrets privilege will be used to bar a claim at most only when the party that is relying on secret information is trying to use the Federal court to alter the legal status quo." Counsel for General Dynamics argued that the government is unable to prove that the contractor defaulted on the contract, meaning that the government terminated the contract for convenience and the company should keep the money paid for the partially performed services. The US <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit </a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/07-5111.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Navy was justified in canceling the contract because the companies were not fulfilling their contractual obligations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The move clears the way for Honduras to be readmitted to the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/">Organization of American States</a> (OAS) [official website], which expelled the country after the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/honduras-president-removed-from-country.php">June 2009 coup</a> [JURIST report] that saw Zelaya's ouster.

The complaint names the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> and <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> [official websites] as defendants, alleging the agencies withheld documents regarding if and how the US government and its interests affected the coup.

Mendez has called for a full investigation of all claims of rape and torture by security forces. Ben Ali left the presidency  and fled the country in January after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] amid nationwide protests, banning public gatherings and allowing police to fire on anyone refusing to obey orders. The current interim government is led by the former leader of the lower house of parliament, Foued Mebezza, who <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">assumed power as interim president</a> [JURIST report] and will remain in power until elections are held.

<p>There have been numerous reports of violence and torture against protesters by security forces during and after the revolution. In April, the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/tunisia-charges-ousted-president-with-protester-abuse.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former president Ben Ali with 18 offenses ranging from murder and conspiracy to trafficking and drug use. The charges stem mostly from allegations that Ben Ali authorized the use of force against protesters during the Tunisian revolution, resulting in the deaths of more than 200 protesters. The charges come after advocacy groups <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] called for the Tunisian transitional government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-tunisia-protester-abuses.php">investigate incidents of police violence against protesters</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hrw-calls-for-end-to-police-violence-in-tunisia-protests.php">end police brutality</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Quintana <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11046&LangID=E">made a statement</a> [text] Monday in conclusion to his mission to Thailand to study the government of Myanmar, where he has not been allowed to visit. He does not believe that the government is doing enough to provide a political solution to the ethnic conflicts in the border areas. Though he did say that the creation of national, state, and regional legislatures was a positive step, that it was alone not sufficient to stop the problem. Quintana said:<blockquote>the situation of ethnic minority groups in the border areas presents serious limitations to the Government's intention to transition to democracy. Violence continues in many of these areas. Systematic militarization contributes to human rights abuses. These abuses include land confiscation, forced labor, internal displacement, extrajudicial killings and sexual violence. They are widespread, they continue today, and they remain essentially unaddressed by the authorities.</blockquote>He also concluded that infrastructure projects had resulted in human rights abuses and said private companies should have a duty to no be complicit with such abuses.

<p>Myanmar is struggling to transition to democracy with problems such as detaining political prisoners. Last week, Myanmar began releasing close to 15,000 prisoners, but many human rights groups claim the government is still holding many more political prisoners. Quintana urged Myanmar's military government to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">release 2,202 political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] last December. Quintana called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," many of whom, he says, suffer from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy. In March, Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">underwent a transfer of power</a> [BBC report] from a military regime to a civil system after holding its first elections in 20 years. However, critics argue that the new regime is merely a sham since it is made up of military generals and with the military party winning 80 percent of the vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/preliminary-annual-ucr-jan-dec-2010">Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report, January-December 2010</a> [text] also showed a decrease in murder by 4.4 percent and in rape by 4.2 percent. The highest drop was the decrease in robbery at 9.5 percent. However, when broken down into four regions, Northeast, Midwest, South, and West, the Northeast saw an increase in murder by 8.3 percent, making it the only region to have a murder increase. The South saw significant decreases in crime with a 7.5 percent drop in both violent crimes and murder and a decrease of 12.6 percent in robberies. Cities voluntarily submit the data to the FBI, and the FBI warns that it might not create accurate city to city comparisons. All the figures are preliminary.

The special deposition hearing allows for evidence to be heard before the court and preserved in the accused's absence pursuant to the new Rule 71 <em>bis</em> of the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/English/Legal/ROP/100209.pdf">ICTR Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [text, PDF]. Rule 71 <em>bis</em> states that "if within a reasonable time, a warrant of arrest has not been executed, the Prosecutor may submit a request to the President that evidence relating to the indictment be preserved for a further trial by special deposition recorded in a proceeding conducted by a single Judge." The prosecutor wants to preserve in the absence of Kabuga for fear that it may be lost due to death, the passage of time or the unavailability of witnesses in the future. Rule 71 <em>bis</em> was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jOtOg58OpeBlCe-2MZ6GWEAAU2NA?docId=CNG.31087bd0b1c2741a2b104c2812fe3980.471">adopted</a> [AFP report] by the judges in a plenary session in 2009, and the proceeding is unprecedented in the ICTR. It is believed that Kabuga is in Kenya, and the ICTR has <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/un-war-crimes-tribunals-call-for.php">previously called</a> [JURIST report] for him to be turned over, but he nonetheless remains in hiding. Kabuga is accused of providing militia with tens of thousands of machetes used in the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwanda+genocide">news archive</a>].</p>

<p>The ICTR continues to prosecute individuals for their roles in the Rwandan genocide. In March the ICTR handed out its <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-sentences-former-mayor-to-life-in-prison.php">strongest punishment to date</a> [JURIST report], life in prison, against Jean-Baptiste Gatete, the former Mayor of Murambi Commune in Byumba prefecture. Gatete's case was one of several Rwandan genocide cases not <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-transfers-25-cases-to-rwandan-jurisdiction.php">transferred to Rwandan authorities</a> [JURIST report]. In January the trial of former military official <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8292684.stm">Idelphonse Nizeyimana</a> [BBC profile], nicknamed the <a href="http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/article/top-rwanda-genocide-suspect-trial-starts-un-court">"Butcher of Butare"</a> [RNW report], <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-begins-trial-of-former-military-official.php">began before the ICTR</a> [JURIST report]. Nizeyimana is accused of being among the Rwanda Armed Forces officers who played key roles in the Rwandan genocide. In December a French court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/france-judge-charges-rwanda-rebel-leader-with-war-crimes-report.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/fdlr.htm">Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] leader Callixte Mbarushimana with war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the Rwandan genocide after the ICTR refused to file charges against him due to insufficient evidence. In September, the trial of Gregoire Ndahimana, former governor of Kivumu, Rwanda, <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-opens-trial-of-ex-mayor.php">began before the ICTR</a> [JURIST report] for his alleged role in the bulldozing of a parish which resulted in the deaths of 2,000 individuals hiding inside.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://valawyersweekly.com/vlwblog/files/2011/05/LibertyBriefingOrder.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] parties to file briefs discussing whether the challenge to the <a href="/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">health care reform law</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>] is barred by a federal law that prevents injunctions against taxes before the tax is imposed. The lawsuits in this consolidated appeal challenge the constitutionality of the individual mandate, which requires that all citizens purchase health insurance. The three-judge panel asked the parties to address the applicability of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [text] and whether the individual mandate can be considered a "tax" under the Act regardless if it is a "tax" for Article I purposes. During <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report], the government had argued that the individual mandate was an extension of the power to tax and that a failure to comply would be enforced through taxation. The Department of Justice (DOJ) had also tried to have the challenges dismissed under the Anti-Injunction Act, but those arguments were rejected, and the government did not make that argument on appeal. The two lawsuits are being brought by the state of Virginia and <a href="http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website], founded by the late Jerry Falwell. The Liberty University lawsuit appeals a decision to <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismiss its challenge</a> of the individual mandate, while Virginia is seeking to uphold a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling that it is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. The parties have until May 31 to file their briefs.

<p>The constitutionality of the individual mandate is a source of controversy and has spawned multiple lawsuits. Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] asked the parties to respond to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/sixth-circuit-asks-health-care-challengers-to-explain-why-they-can-sue.php">whether the court had standing</a> [JURIST report] to hear a challenge before the effective date of the law. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] sought to have its challenge reinstated in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] after it was dismissed by the lower court. Last February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked federal judge Roger Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">clarify that states must continue to enact the health care reform law</a> as the government appeals from Vinson's January ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">finding the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Microsoft is seeking to reduce or eliminate its fine of 899 million euros (USD $1.3 billion) in the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/presentation">General Court</a> [official website], the EU's second highest court. The company argues that the fines charged by the regulators under the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/24/us-microsoft-eu-idUSTRE74M3LP20110524">excessive and undeserved</a> [Reuters report] because the EU regulators were not clear on how to follow the order. The EU set the then-record fine in 2008 after it found that Microsoft was not complying with the 2004 antitrust order to provide information so that other products could run on Microsoft-powered computers. The noncompliance fine was nearly double the original fine imposed in 2004. Microsoft has been embroiled in a decade-long battle with EU regulators and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/may/24/microsoft-antitrust-fine-eu">may have to wait six months to a year</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] for the appeals verdict.

<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/microsoft-to-file-anti-competition-complaint-against-google-in-europe.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the EC over alleged anticompetitive practices by <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/">Google</a> [corporate website], which is <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/eu-announces-antitrust-probe-into-google-business-practices.php">under investigation</a> [JURIST report] by the EC for allegations of manipulation of search results to highlight Google's own products and services. In October 2007, Microsoft said it would <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/microsoft-to-comply-with-eu-antitrust.php">take the necessary steps</a> [JURIST report] to comply with the 2004 EC antitrust ruling. The software company agreed to allow open source software developers to access and use interoperability information, reduce the royalties for a worldwide license, and make agreements between third party developers and Microsoft enforceable before the High Court in London.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The guilty pleas by Jilani Abdiali and Burhan Abdirahman Yusuf join those entered Friday by <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/somali-pirate-pleads-guilty-in-us-court.php">Mohamud Hirs Issa Ali</a> [JURIST report], Mohamud Salad Ali and Ali Abdi Mohamed in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website]. The men have all admitted to engaging in piracy for financial gain and participating in the taking of the Quest. They deny personally shooting the hostages. US Attorney Neil MacBride said:<blockquote>These Somali pirates admitted that they hijacked a US ship planning to make a big ransom off the four American hostages. Tragically, their co-conspirators gunned down the hostages in cold blood and these pirates now face spending the rest of their lives in prison, We hope the string of convictions in this and other cases help send a message to others that piracy against American vessels will not be tolerated.</blockquote>Sentencing is scheduled for August 22 for Yusuf and September 6 for Abdiali. Both are expected to receive sentences of life in prison. Under the plea agreement, however, they could serve less time and eventually be deported to Somalia. There were 14 suspects <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-court-indicts-14-suspected-pirates.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the attack, and others are expected to plead guilty soon.

<p>Earlier this month, Spain's National Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/spain-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-439-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Somali pirates to 439 years in prison each for their involvement in the 2009 hijacking of a Spanish fishing boat off the coast of Somalia. Last month, a US district court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">sentenced a Somali pirate to 25 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in attacking a Danish ship, as well as the US Navy's USS Ashland. In November, a federal jury in Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] five Somali men on charges of piracy for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nichols. In August, piracy charges against six defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>

A judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website]<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304520804576341891896098036.html?mod=googlenews_wsj"> approved the settlement plan</a> [WSJ report] in which the plaintiffs' attorneys, the <a href="http://www.alterslaw.com/en/home.php">Alters Law Firm</a> [corporate website], will receive as much as 30 percent of the settlement. BOA is just one of a number of large banks involved in the class action suit, including: <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup</a>, <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/home.htm">JP Morgan Chase</a> and <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/">Wells Fargo</a> [corporate websites]. The settlement with BOA, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/bank-of-america-settles-excessive-overdraft-fee-lawsuit.php">reached in February</a> [JURIST report], will provide remedy for more than a million plaintiffs in the class. 

<p>BOA is among more than two dozen US, Canadian and European lenders named as defendants in the class action lawsuit, which consolidated claims across the country in 2009. In their <a href="http://www.bank-overdraft.com/pdf/20091102-bofa-complaint.pdf">amended complaint</a> [text, PDF], the plaintiffs claimed that BOA's practices were deceptive in that they did not reasonably notify customers that they had the option of opting out of the overdraft scheme and declining transactions. The complaint also alleged that BOA's excessive fees disproportionately effect low-income customers. BOA has been the target of several lawsuits. In January, plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/investors-sue-bank-of-america-subsidiary-for-fraud.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20080111-1147-bankofamerica-countrywide-optional-timeline.html">Countrywide Financial Corporation</a> [AP backgrounder], a BOA subsidiary, in <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/supctmanh/">New York State Supreme Court</a> [official website] alleging widespread fraud that resulted in substantial financial losses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The two men, already serving a sentence handed down in 2005 for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a>, were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December of embezzling from their company, Yukos Oil, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to an additional eight years. They <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/khodorkovsky-files-appeal-seeks-probe-against-judge.php">appealed</a>, alleging, among other things, that Judge Viktor Danilkin did <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/khodorkovsky-verdict-product-of-coercion-judges-assistant.php">not write the verdict</a> [JURIST reports] and that he was coerced into reading it. Khodorkovsky vehemently <a href="http://khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/appeal-denied-khodorkovsky-slams-courts-destruction-law-treason-against-peopl">criticized</a> [press release] Tuesday's ruling as flying in the face of the rule of law. The two men can now expect to be released in 2016 instead of 2017. Their lawyers <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/khodorkovsky-loses-appeal-but-sentence-is-reduced/2011/05/24/AF6pzTAH_story.html">plan to appeal</a> [WP report] to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website].

<p>The December verdict drew harsh <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution." The <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main">Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Russian] dismissed critics, <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/ECD8813967CD249EC32578070037C1D6">saying</a> [press release, in Russian] that "[a]ttempts to exert pressure on the court are unacceptable."

In March 2010, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-yukos-oil-executive-criticizes.php">criticized Russia's justice system</a> [JURIST report] as an "assembly line" that inevitably finds the government's political enemies to be guilty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The EC, the EU's executive arm, said that <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/news/business/110524_en.htm">reforms are necessary</a> [press release] to better protect against Internet piracy and to protect consumers from fake products. The EC said that counterfeiters are going beyond copying luxury goods but that there is also a problem with fake health and hygiene products, car parts and cosmetics. The EC's proposed changes include: creating a unitary-patent protection scheme across the EU, modernizing the trademark system to protect brands and easing access to copyrighted works. Michel Barnier, the EU internal markets commissioner, made a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/630&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">statement</a> [text]:<blockquote>Ensuring the right level of protection of intellectual property rights in the single market is essential for Europe's economy. Progress depends on new ideas and new knowledge. There will be no investment in innovation if rights are not protected. On the other hand, consumers and users need to have access to cultural content, for example online music, for new business models and cultural diversity to both thrive. Our aim today is to get the balance between these two objectives right for [intellectual property rights] across the board. To make Europe's framework for intellectual property an enabler for companies and citizens and fit for the online world and the global competition for ideas.</blockquote>There are inefficiencies with current EU intellectual property regulation such as music producers having to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/8534196/European-Commision-announces-legal-blueprint-for-digital-piracy-in-intellectual-property-rights-overhaul.html">gain permission</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] from each of the 27 EU nations before selling it across the EU. 

<p>Online piracy has assumed increasing importance in the eyes of legislators across Europe. In March 2010, a study conducted by the <a href="http://www.marsouin.org/">Marsouin Unit</a> [official website, in French] at the <a href="http://www.univ-rennes1.fr/english/home/">University of Rennes</a> [official website] found that in France some forms of <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/france-internet-piracy-increasing.php">online piracy are on the rise</a> [JURIST report] in spite of the recently passed <a href="http://www.senat.fr/dossierleg/pjl07-405.html">anti-piracy law</a> [legislative materials, in French; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=france+internet+piracy">news archive</a>]. Some European countries, including the UK, have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8569750.stm">considered legislation</a> [BBC report] that reflects the law enacted in France.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, many are still skeptical that Mubarak will actually make it to court, especially since he was able to evade detention for so long. Also, some human rights activists are concerned with the prosecutor's lack of transparency. The announcement comes before a planned demonstration Friday calling for Mubarak to stand trial. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] published a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/egypt-must-prosecute-all-those-responsible-protest-killings-2011-05-24">statement</a> [press release] Tuesday calling for all those responsible for killing protesters to be tried, including the military. If Mubarak goes to trial, it would be the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43151238">first time in modern history</a> [AP report] an Arab leader has been toppled and tried solely by the nation's own people.

<p>Last week, AI reported that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">at least 840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report], and more than 6,000 were injured, during the Egyptian protests. Earlier this month, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-court-convicts-former-tourism-minister-for-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] the country's former tourism minister, Zoheir Garranah, for corruption and sentenced him to five years in prison. In April, Egyptian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/former-egypt-officials-charged-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former prime minister Ahmed Nazif, former finance minister Yousef Boutros and former interior minister Habib el Adly with corruption. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused the former president</a> [JURIST report] and the country's police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations. The joint commission submitted their report to Egypt's top prosecutor for further investigation. The Supreme Military Council of Egypt, which assumed power after Mubarak's resignation, instructed Egypt's top prosecutor to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110323/163161631.html">investigate the death of protesters</a> [RIA Novosti report] during the three weeks of demonstrations in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

She was charged under <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16257/preview">Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine</a> [text] with <a href="http://www.gp.gov.ua/ua/news.html?_m=publications&_c=view&_t=rec&id=93242">abuse of office</a> [press release, in Ukrainian] in connection with signing gas import contracts with Russia. She was given the charges when she was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13520048">brought in for questioning</a> [BBC report] by the PGO at the state capital building in Kiev. There was a small group of Tymoshenko supporters protesting outside the building. Tymoshenko denies the charges and argues that they are politically motivated. She criticized the speed at which the case was being moved forward on her website and claimed that the PGO reversed its decision to detain her under public pressure. She said:<blockquote>They behaved as if everything had been decided and they were just carrying out formalities. I don't doubt that during the course of all this they reconsidered their desire to put me in jail only because of pressure from people, pressure from civil society, the media, deputies, and, I think, the international community. ... All of this has been cynically trumped-up, without any hint of the law, because they know there is no real court, and they know that the court will sign and endorse any resolution and decision they write.</blockquote>The investigators argue that the 10-year gas contract deals she signed were too high, harming the economy, and that she did not have cabinet approval to sign them. 

<p>These charges are not the first brought against Tymoshenko by the PGO. In Feburary, the PGO <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ukraine-prosecutors-combine-charges-against-former-pm-tymoshenko.php">combined two separate criminal cases</a> [JURIST report] against her and concluded the pre-trial investigation. The combined cases against Tymoshenko include charges initiated in December for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ukraine-prosecutors-charge-ex-pm-tymoshenko-with-misusing-state-funds.php">allegedly misappropriating state funds</a> during her time as prime minister from 2007-2010 and new charges in January alleging that she <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ukraine-prosecutors-launch-new-investigation-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">abused her authority and exceeded her official duties</a> [JURIST reports] while in office by purchasing "1000 Opel Combo" medical vans at a 20 percent mark-up. Tymoshenko said the vans were successful in providing medical services to rural villages. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian]. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

By targeting defence lawyers, the Iranian authorities are limiting access to competent legal representation, a basic right and important fair trial guarantee.</blockquote>AI and the ICJ had varying requests for other lawyers in flux in Iran, but praised Iran for the release of defense lawyer Mohammad Oliyaeifard after one year of imprisonment.

<p>All of the lawyers mentioned are reportedly involved with Iran's human rights movement. Nasrin Sotoudeh was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/prominent-iran-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-11-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in January to 11 years in prison. Sotoudeh has worked on several high-profile cases. She was the lawyer for Arash Rahmanipour, who was arrested for his role in the post-election protests on charges of <em>mohareb</em>, or being an enemy of God. Rahmanipour was <A href = "/paperchase/2010/01/iran-executes-2-for-post-election.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010. Sotoudeh also represented <A href = "http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2006/july-2006/saharkhiz_24706.shtml">Isa Saharkhiz</a> [Iran Press profile], a well-known press activist who was <A href = "/paperchase/2006/08/iran-court-sentences-outspoken-editor.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to four years in prison in 2006 for publishing articles against the constitution and offending the state media.

Mohammad Seyfzadeh was sentenced for "forming an association ... whose aim is to harm national security" and "being a member of an association whose aim is to harm national security" due to his involvement with the <a href = "http://www.humanrights-ir.org/english/">Centre for Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [advocacy website].

It is also unknown if her husband has received a new lawyer. Ghasem Sholeh Saadi, a former member of Parliament and potential presidential candidate, was arrested and sentenced for a year and a half for writing a letter critical of the government.

The Trial Chamber filed an <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/contempt_seselj3/ind/en/110524.pdf">order in lieu of an indictment</a> [text, PDF] for contempt against Seselj because he has not complied with a May 9 order to remove <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/index.php?c=10">three books he authored</a> and five <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/index.php?c=11">confidential filings</a> [defense website] he submitted as part of his current trial and two previous contempt of court trials that reveal the identities of protected witnesses who testified against him. The contempt proceedings were brought under Rule 77(a)(ii) of the <a href="http://www.icls.de/dokumente/icty_rules.pdf">ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [text, PDF], which authorizes the court to hold in contempt anyone who "knowingly and willfully interfere[s] with its administration of justice, including any person who ... discloses information relating to those proceedings in knowing violation of an order of a Chamber." This is the third time the ICTY has brought contempt charges against Seselj for failing to remove books from his website that revealed confidential information.

<p>Earlier this month, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icty-allows-seselj-war-crimes-trial-to-continue.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Seselj's attempt to have the charges against him dismissed, finding sufficient evidence for the trial to continue. He is charged with 14 counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war. Seselj's war crimes trial, which began in 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/icty-resumes-seselj-trial-after-delay.php">resumed in early 2010</a>, after <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">being delayed</a> [JURIST reports] for nearly a year over fears that witnesses were being intimidated. In February, Seselj <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icty-begins-contempt-trial-over-witness-identity-revelations.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST report] on charges that he released the names of 11 ICTY witnesses in violation of a confidentiality order. Last May, the ICTY appeals division <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icty-upholds-contempt-conviction-of-serb-nationalist-leader.php">upheld</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icty-convicts-seselj-of-contempt-for.php">2009 contempt verdict</a> [JURIST reports] against Seselj for revealing the identities of other witnesses that were supposed to remain confidential. Seselj is accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the SRS, which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Munguambe and the others began to serve their sentences after the proceeding.

<p>The trial was the largest corruption proceeding brought in Mozambique since the country achieved independence from Portugal in 1975, involving the theft of USD $1.7 million from the ADM during Munguambe's tenure in office between 2005 and 2008. The trial <a href = "http://www.poptel.org.uk/mozambique-news/newsletter/aim391.html">began</a> [AIM report] in November 2009 as part of a larger initiative of the <a href = "http://www.portaldogoverno.gov.mz/">Mozambican government</a> [official website, in Portuguese] to reduce corruption in the government. <a href = "http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website] ranks <a href = "http://www.transparency.org/content/download/55725/890310/CPI_report_ForWeb.pdf">Mozambique among the most corrupt in the world</a> [2010 CPI report, PDF].

Brewer said that it is necessary to <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_52411_GovBrewerAGHorneAnnounceSuitAMMA.pdf">see if the new law violates federal law</a> [press release, PDF] in order to protect state workers charged with distributing the marijuana from federal prosecution. The lawsuit was spurred by a May 2 <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/54470108/Burke-on-Prop203">letter</a> [text] sent to the <a href="http://www.azdhs.gov/">Arizona Department of Health Services</a> (ADHS) [official website] by Dennis Burke, the US Attorney for the District of Arizona, warning the department that, regardless of the new state law, marijuana remains illegal under federal law. The letter stated that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/">US Attorneys Office</a> (USAO) [official website] would still prosecute those who manufacture and distribute the substance and that clear and unambiguous compliance with state law would not protect consumers from prosecution. Brewer decided to seek guidance from a federal court, saying:<blockquote>For the state employees charged with administering the medical marijuana program or the Arizonans who intend to participate as consumers, it's important that we receive court guidance as to whether they are at risk for federal prosecution. As explained in a recent letter from the U.S. Attorney for Arizona, the federal government considers marijuana a controlled substance. Arizonans deserve clarity on an issue with such dire legal implications.</blockquote>The ADHS Director, Will Humble, said that the department will <a href="http://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/?p=1454">continue to distribute</a> [blog post] qualified patient and designated caregiver cards through its website. 

<p>Last November, Arizona <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-medical-marijuana-law.php">voters approved</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.azsos.gov/election/2010/general/ballotmeasuretext/I-04-2010.pdf">Proposition 203</a> [text, PDF] by a slim margin 50.13 to 49.87 percent, authorizing the possession of up to two-and-a-half ounces of medical marijuana or up to 12 cannabis plants. The medical marijuana is only allowed for individuals with any of a set list of medical conditions including cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and AIDS who have gotten a recommendation from their physician and have registered with the Arizona Department of Health Services. Arizona is the fifteenth state to legalize medical marijuana. In addition to Arizona, voters in California, South Dakota and Oregon also voted on a range of marijuana-based propositions during the midterm elections, all of which were rejected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law requires that the use of the pill, 
<a href = "http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111323.htm">RU-486</a> [FDA guidelines], conform with federal guidelines, which currently do not allow the pill to be used after seven weeks of pregnancy. Judge Susan Dlott originally placed an <a href = "http://suealtmeyer.typepad.com/cleveland_law_library_web/files/plannedparent.pdf">injunction on the law</a> [opinion, PDF] in 2006, finding it unconstitutional due to vagueness. The case was then appealed to the <a href = "http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href = "http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0216p-06.pdf">certified two questions</a> [opinion, PDF] for the <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website]: "Does O.R.C. 2919.123 mandate that physicians in Ohio who perform abortions using mifepristone do so in compliance with the forty-nine-day gestational limit described in the FDA approval letter?" and "Does O.R.C. 2919.123 mandate that physicians in Ohio who perform abortions using mifepristone do so in compliance with the treatment protocols and dosage indications described in the drug's final printed labeling?" The Ohio Supreme Court <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2009/2009-ohio-2972.pdf">opinion</a> [text, PDF] found in the affirmative for both questions. Based on this ruling, Dlott found the law constitutional, rejecting the argument by <A href = "http://www.plannedparenthood.org/swoh/">Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio</a> [advocacy website] that the law was still vague and forced women to choose surgical abortions. Planned Parenthood has not determined whether they will appeal the ruling. 

<p>Oklahoma has also <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">prohibited the use of RU-486</a> [JURIST report]. In April, the Ohio Senate <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would limit the availability of abortions after 20 weeks. That bill is pending in the House. <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports] have each passed legislation this year which restricts the abortion procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Also, earlier this year, a legislative committee in the Ohio House of Representatives <a href = "http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/03/30/abortion-bill-may-get-house-committee-vote-today.html?sid=101">advanced</a> [<em>Columbus Dispatch</em> report] the <a href = "http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_HB_125_RH_Y.pdf">"Heartbeat Bill,"</a> [HB 125 text], which would ban abortions after the point at which a fetus's heartbeat becomes detectable in the womb. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Although she criticized some of the nation's practices, she had considerable praise for "a strong history of commitment to human rights at the international level, and also of course a robust system of democratic institutions." Nonetheless, she believes improvements are necessary in the realm of treatment of Aborigines and immigrants.<blockquote>I welcome the National Apology and Australia's formal recognition of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, along with the significant investment being made to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and education. However, I believe these efforts are being undermined by policies that fail to recognise the right to self-determination for indigenous people, which is a key element of the UN Declaration.

<p>In my discussions with Aboriginal people, I could sense the deep hurt and pain that they have suffered because of government policies that are imposed on them. I also saw Aboriginal people making great efforts to improve their communities, but noted that their efforts are often stifled by inappropriate and inflexible policies that fail to empower the most effective, local solutions.</blockquote>On the topic of asylum-seekers, Pillay described situations where refugees wait in immigration centers for months or years. She recommended greater communication with both groups, a revamp of how the Aborigine Northern Territory is handled, and for political leaders to quit "demonizing" refugees and immigrants. </p>

<p>In recent years, the Australian government has recognized the long history of discrimination and disadvantage among its native citizens, although its efforts have not always resulted in better conditions. Last year, Australian <a href = "http://www.pm.gov.au/">Prime Minister Julia Gillard</a> [official website] announced a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/australia-announces-referendum-to-recognize-indigenous-people-in-constitution.php">national referendum</a> [JURIST report] to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the Australian Constitution. In August 2010, <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org.au/">Amnesty International Australia</a> (AIA) [advocacy website] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/australia-racial-discrimination-violates-international-obligations.php">criticized the racial discrimination</a> [JURIST report] that exists in Australia, which, according to AIA, violates the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> and the <a href = "http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/drip.html">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [texts]. In June, the Australian government <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/australia-reinstates-racial-discrimination-laws.php">reinstated its previously suspended Racial Discrimination Act</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern Territory, which allows governmental authorities to regulate how welfare money is spent by the indigenous people of the country. UN special rapporteur James Anaya condemned the law, calling it problematic from a human rights point of view. In 2009, Australia <a href = "/paperchase/2009/04/australia-endorses-un-declaration-on.php">endorsed</a> [JURIST report] the aforementioned Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, which reversed the position held by previous Australian governments. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd championed the cause of improved living conditions for and relations with Australia's indigenous population during his term in office and offered an official apology on behalf of the federal government in February 2008 for past mistreatment to the nation's indigenous population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www2.camara.gov.br/agencia/noticias/MEIO-AMBIENTE/197560-CAMARA-APROVA-NOVO-CODIGO-FLORESTAL-COM-MUDANCA-EM-REGRAS-PARA-APPS.html">amended code would allow</a> [press release, in Portuguese] small farmers to cut down trees on hilltops and along rivers, two areas that were previously protected. It would also provide farmers with amnesty for violations of the forest code prior to July 22, 2008. The amendments were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13544000">mainly pushed</a> [BBC report] by <a href="http://www.aldorebelo.com.br/">Alldo Rebelo</a>, head of the <a href="http://www.pcdob.org.br/">Communist Party of Brazil</a> [official websites, in Portuguese], who <a href="http://www.aldorebelo.com.br/?pagina=noticias&cod=1220">argues</a> [press release, in Portuguese] that the restrictions are disproportionately hurting small-scale farmers. The amendments still have to be passed by the <a href="http://www.senado.gov.br/">Senate</a>,  where they are expected to meet tough opposition, and not be vetoed by <a href="http://www.dilma.com.br/site/">President Dilma Rousseff</a> [official websites, in Portuguese] before taking effect. A group of 10 former environmental ministers sent a <a href="http://www.minhamarina.org.br/blog/2011/05/ex-ministros-do-meio-ambiente-pedem-a-dilma-e-ao-congresso-suspensao-da-votacao-do-codigo-florestal/">letter dated May 23</a> [text, in Portuguese] to the president urging a balanced approach to environmental regulation that will promote both the agricultural industry and environmental sustainability.

<p>The amendments to the forest code are the latest in Brazilian initiatives that attempt to find a balance between economic development and environmental concerns over Amazon deforestation. In June 2009, then-president <a href="http://www.presidencia.gov.br/presidente/">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> [official profile, in Portuguese] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/brazil-president-signs-controversial.php">approved a controversial measure</a> [JURIST report] that would allow legal privatization of publicly held Amazon land. The measure was aimed at stabilizing ownership of nearly 260,000 square miles of Amazon land, the contested ownership of which has sparked violence in the region. Da Silva vetoed sections of the bill, which some critics, including <a href="http://www.amazonia.org.br/english/guia/detalhes.cfm?id=314924&amp;tipo=6&amp;cat_id=80&amp;subcat_id=387">legislators</a> [letter, text], <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/amazonia/noticias/lula-cede-de-ruralistas-e-pres">environmentalists</a> [Greenpeace press release, in Portuguese], and state prosecutors, had argued unjustly rewarded illegal land grabs and failed to distinguish between small farmers and large corporate and absentee landlords. Earlier in June 2009, the government <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idINN1946753020090619">announced</a> [Reuters report] a program to pay farmers in the Amazon to reforest cleared land. IN 2008, Brazil set a goal to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7759192.stm">reduce Amazon deforestation by 70 percent</a> [BBC report] over the next 10 years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Munyagishari was wanted on charges of genocide and several crimes against humanity for leading a militia in the mass killings and rapes of Tutsi women. Munyagishari is being transferred to the ICTR from the DRC soon, but it is unknown when he will face trial. Nine major perpetrators of the <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Rwandan+Genocide">news archive</a>] remain at-large.

<p>The ICTR <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-ex-military-chief-bizimungu-3-others.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan army chief Augustin Bizimungu and three others last week. Last December, the ICTR <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/ictr-convicts-former-military-officer-of-genocide.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan Armed Forces lieutenant Ildephonse Hategekimana to life imprisonment after convicting him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. The court found Hategekimana guilty of three counts of genocide stemming from his involvement in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, specifically in the massacre of civilian Tutsis in the Rwandan town of Butare. Last month, the ICTR <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/ictr-removes-us-defense-lawyer-from-tribunal-work.php">removed</a> US lawyer and JURIST <a href = "/forum/">Forum</a> [website] contributor <a href = "http://www.wmitchell.edu/academics/faculty/erlinder.asp">Peter Erlinder</a> [professional profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Erlinder">news archive</a>] from his position as an ICTR defense lawyer. The appeals chamber said the dismissal was due to Erlinder's failure to appear at a tribunal and cited <a href = "http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/rules/260600/index.htm">Rule 46 of the ICTR Rules of Procedure and Evidence</a> [text] which allows the court impose sanctions for lawyer's misconduct. Erlinder <a href = "/forum/2011/05/peter-erlinder-ictr-genocide-denial.php">argues</a> [JURIST op-ed] the dismissal was part of a wider history of institutional bias that has helped the Rwandan government label him and other defense counsel "genocide deniers" subject to official threats of arrest and even death. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/noticias/item/11798-abc-de-la-ley-de-victimas-informe-especial">Victims' Law and Land Restitution Law</a> [backgrounder, in Spanish] will provide financial compensation and restitution of land to victims of internal armed conflicts involving paramilitaries and guerrillas during the past 30 years. Individuals who feel they have been victimized by the conflicts since January 1, 1985 are eligible for financial compensation, and those who have also had their land seized or abandoned their land in the wake of armed conflict are subject to restitution of their land. The government estimates that 4 million hectares of land were abandoned and 2 million were seized during conflicts. The government will utilize the current court system to hear litigation regarding compensation and restitution. Senator <a href="http://www.juanfernandocristo.com/sitio/">Juan Fernando Cristo</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/noticias/item/11960-plenaria-del-senado-ya-aprobo-187-articulos-de-la-ley-de-victimas-/-nuevo-avance">stated</a> [press release, in Spanish] that, while the law is not perfect, it is "a good law and part two of the history of this country." The entire process is expected to take 10 years to complete.

<p>The US federal court system has heard several cases regarding corporate involvement in Colombian violence. In February, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/eleventh-circuit-revives-colombia-wrongful-death-suit-against-alabama-company.php">revived a wrongful death lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought against <a href="http://www.drummondco.com/">Drummond Company</a> [corporate website]. The plaintiffs alleged that, after Drummond employees in Colombia successfully unionized, the company hired the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/colombia/farc-eln-colombias-left-wing-guerrillas/p9272">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CFR backgrounder], a group of paramilitaries, to break up the union and murder its leaders, plaintiff's fathers. In April 2010, victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/chiquita-sued-in-us-court-for-aiding.php">filed suit against Chiquita Brand International</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a>. The plaintiffs were 242 Colombians who alleged that they had been seriously injured or had family members killed by the AUC, which received funding from Chiquita.  In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/chiquita-to-pay-25m-to-settle-terrorism.php">Chiquita was fined $25 million</a> [JURIST report] after it admitted to making payments of around $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to the AUC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last week a convoy of UN peacekeepers transporting troops of the northern Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) was attacked just north of Abyei, which is claimed by both sides but has been held by the southern Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) since the 2005 peace deal that stifled the country's bloody civil war. Over the weekend the SAF responded to the assault on its troops by attacking and taking control of Abyei itself. The situation has raised fears of reigniting the north-south conflict that left 1.5 million dead. Pillay urged that civilians be afforded safe passage and protected pursuant to international human rights and humanitarian law. Stated Pillay:<blockquote>I condemn the recent attacks and counter-attacks in the Abyei region by both sides&#8212;this is certainly no way to advance the peaceful coexistence of North and South Sudan. I am particularly alarmed by the shelling of civilian areas in Abyei by the SAF, as well as reports of aerial bombardment in other locations. ... I urge all parties to explore a negotiated solution to the Abyei crisis and to avoid a descent into further conflict and chaos.</blockquote> Since the northern forces took over, the UN has confirmed reports of bombing and shelling in and around Abyei by the SAF, as well as widespread looting and burning of houses. Aid workers <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13549157">estimate 40,000 people have fled the area</a> [BBC report]. While the UN has said that attacks on its peacekeepers amount to war crimes under international law, both the UN and the US have called on the northern troops to withdraw from Abyei. From the northern capital of Khartoum <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile] has stated he will not withdraw troops from the region and insisted that the area belongs to the north.

The former army officers have been in prison since 2007 after being accused of planning to violently topple <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>] and replace him with the country's defense minister, Emerson Mnangagwa. The court held it is apparent that the defendants <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/05/24/zimbabwe.coup.plotters/">should not have been detained</a> [CNN report], and a declaratory order will be issued to that effect. The High Court had dismissed the case in July because the defendants were held in custody without being brought to trial for more than six months, the limit imposed by law. The dismissal resulted in a re-indictment by prosecutors, but the defendants appealed to have the re-indictment thrown out At this time the state has not announced whether it plans to pursue the matter further. In Zimbabwe treason is punishable by death.

<p>In March a Zimbabwe magistrate court ordered six of 45 activists arrested in Harare <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/zimbabwe-court-detains-activists-on-treason-charges.php">detained on charges of treason</a> [JURIST report], releasing the remaining 39. The six activists not released will stand for the treason charges against them. The charges and subsequent arrests stem from the activists' attendance at a lecture on February 19, where footage of the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/over-1000-detained-in-egypt-amid-widespread-protests.php">widespread protests in Egypt</a> [JURIST report], which resulted in the ouster of Egyptian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">President Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile], was shown. Defense lawyers maintain they were participating in an academic debate on African politics while prosecutors contend they were engaged in a discussion regarding the possibility of an ouster of Mugabe. In making its decision, the court considered the activities each engaged in and held that the majority of them could be released as they had merely listened to allegedly treasonous utterances, in contrast with the other six who had organized and spoken at the meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mladic was one of the two remaining at-large war criminals sought by the <a href = "http://www.icty.org">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], along with Goran Hadzic. Mladic faces <a href = "http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/ind/en/mla-ai021010e.pdf">charges</a> [amended indictment, PDF] of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages.

<center><iframe width="425" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/orHB37k8SVA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

<p>Extradition proceedings for trial in The Hague, Netherlands could <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13561407">take a week</a> [BBC Report]. Despite overwhelming international approval of the arrest, <a href = "hhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/serbia/8538195/Ratko-Mladic-man-behind-Srebrenica-massacre-arrested-in-Serbia-live-coverage.html">including statements</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] from European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, British Prime Minister David Cameron and <a href = "http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_74762.htm">NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh-Rasmussen</a> [press release], a <A href = "http://b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=03&dd=15&nav_id=73248">poll earlier this year</a> [B92 report] showed 52 percent of Serbians against Mladic's extradition. Although the capture of outstanding war criminals was one of the final bars to Serbia joining the EU, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated that the arrest will <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/serbia-mladic-dutch-idUSWEA341320110526">not automatically result in accession</a> [Reuters].</p>

<p>In December, the First Municipal Court in Belgrade <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/serbia-court-acquits-10-accused-of-aiding-war-crimes-suspect-mladic.php">acquitted 10 men</a> [JURIST report] suspected of helping Mladic evade arrest. In September, ICTY prosecutor <a href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] <A href = "/paperchase/2010/09/icty-prosecutor-urges-greater-effort-to-arrest-war-crimes-suspect-mladic.php">called on Serbia and other governments</a> [JURIST report] to increase efforts to find and arrest Mladic. Brammertz said failure to arrest Mladic would send war criminals the message that if they avoid capture long enough, the world will cease to care about bringing them to justice. Brammertz also emphasized the importance of seeking justice for Mladic's victims. Authorities must work quickly to arrest Mladic, Brammertz noted, since the ICTY is scheduled to be shut down in three years. Last May, Mladic's family filed a claim in the Belgrade District Court <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/mladic-family-seeks-official-death-declaration.php">seeking to have him declared officially dead</a> [JURIST report] in order to collect his state pension and sell his property. Earlier that month, the ICTY announced that the Office of the Prosecutor filed a motion to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-amend-mladic-indictment.php">amend the indictment against Mladic</a> [JURIST report] to include 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in order to help speed up court proceedings once Mladic is captured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Larry Burns for the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] made the ruling <a href="http://azstarnet.com/news/local/crime/article_1d5ce648-86f8-11e0-82ec-001cc4c03286.html">based on separate reports</a> [<em>Arizona Daily Star</em> report] by psychologist Dr. Christina Pietz and psychiatrist Dr. Matthew Carroll who both evaluated Loughner and agreed that he is schizophrenic. Both the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/55643372/Defense-letter-on-compentency-docs">defense</a> and the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/55643102/Prosecution-letter-on-compentency-docs">prosecution</a> [motions text] stipulated to the accuracy of the information contained in the reports. The judge agreed that Loughner is unable to understand the proceedings against him and is unable to help in his defense. He was ordered to a federal psychiatric facility where he may remain until being determined fit to stand trial. During the hearing, Loughner apparently made nonsensical outbursts interrupting the proceedings.

<p>Loughner was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/new-indictment-filed-against-accused-arizona-shooter.php">indicted on 49-counts</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the Arizona shooting earlier this year at a "Congress on your Corner" event hosted by <a href="http://giffords.house.gov/">Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords</a> (D-AR) [official website], who is believed by authorities to be the target of the shootings. The indictment carries more severe charges than the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/accused-arizona-gunman-indicted.php">original indictment</a> [JURIST report] filed in January, accounting for all victims of the attack and carrying more serious penalties. The previous indictment received criticism because some people felt that it ignored many of the victims. Six people were <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-01-08-gifford-shooting_N.htm">killed in the shooting</a> [USA Today report], including a Giffords staffer, a 9-year-old girl and federal judge John Roll. Giffords was critically injured when she was shot in the head from point blank range.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tinklenberg</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that time for pretrial motions, regardless of whether they actually delay or are expected to delay the beginning of a trial, is excluded from the time in which the accused must be brought to trial. Jason Louis Tinklenberg was convicted of making methamphetamine. His trial began 287 days after his arraignment. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00003161----000-.html">Speedy Trial Act of 1974</a> (STA) [18 USC &#167; 3161(h)(1)(D) text] requires that accused be brought to trial within 70 days of the arraignment, but time can be excluded for things like pretrial motions. The opinion of the court, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, affirmed the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0323p-06.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] to dismiss the charges but disagreed with its reasoning. The Sixth Circuit reasoned that the STA's exemption for "delay resulting from" pretrial motions most reasonably means that the motions actually cause delay or have an expectation to cause delay in the trial. The Supreme Court disagreed with this interpretation as not supported by the context of the phrase and that the courts of appeals have consistently rejected that reasoning in the 37-year history of the STA. Further, the court argued that its interpretation is supported by legislative history and that the Sixth Circuit's standard would make it more difficult to administer, thus hindering the STA's intention to secure fair and efficient trials. However, the court agreed that the indictment should be dismissed because the Sixth Circuit had improperly excluded transportation time in excess of 10 days for weekends and holiday. When the weekends and holidays were added it pushed the time period to trial over the STA's limit. Justice Antonin Scalia, with two others, concurred in the judgment but disagreed with the court's reliance on outside considerations. Scalia argued that the clear meaning of the text itself was that time for pretrial motions should be automatically excluded, regardless of the actual or expected delay. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the decision. 

<p>The court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1498.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-enumerated-powers-speedy-trial-deadlines.php">report</a>] in this case in February. Counsel for the government argued that the court should uphold precedent, saying that "[f]or more than 30 years, the courts of appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless of its effect on the trial schedule." Counsel for Tinklenberg argued that the court should use the "ordinary meaning" of the language in the statute, finding that the trial was delayed unlawfully.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Greene</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-child-abuse-investigations-public-information-disclosures.php">report</a>] for mootness. The initial issue surrounded the circumstances for a warrant allowing officials to interview a minor, without parental notification, about abuse allegations. The <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/12/10/06-35333.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that state child protective services workers Bob Camreta and James Alford were entitled to qualified immunity on <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] claims, relying on both a balancing test and the view that sexual abuse cases require "special needs," but ruled against the defendants on <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] claims. Camreta and Alford appealed the latter part of the decision. The Supreme Court first ruled that it may hear the appeals of prevailing parties in some circumstances. However, since the minor in the case moved out of her jurisdiction and will soon turn 18, the court found the case moot.<blockquote>We conclude that this Court generally may review a lower court's constitutional ruling at the behest of a government official granted immunity. But we may not do so in this case for reasons peculiar to it. The case has become moot because the child has grown up and moved across the country, and so will never again be subject to the Oregon in-school interviewing practices whose constitutionality is at issue. We therefore do not reach the Fourth Amendment question in this case. In line with our normal practice when mootness frustrates a party's right to appeal, we vacate the part of the Ninth Circuit's opinion that decided the Fourth Amendment issue.</blockquote>Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion. Justices Antonin Scalia and Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer, filed concurrences. Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, in dissent, stated he would not have granted <em>certiorari</em>, due to mootness and not allowing prevailing parties to relitigate their claims.

<p>Nearly 10 years ago in Oregon, child services was advised that Nimrod Greene was molesting his 9-year-old daughter, SG, the minor in this case. Camreta and Alford took SG out of class and interrogated her for two hours to determine if she was being sexually abused at home. Due to her answers and the previous allegations, Camreta believed she was being abused and obtained a protective order, removing SG and her sister from the home. SG and her sister were physically examined after this, but their mother was denied from being present at the examination. She eventually filed suit on behalf of her children against Camreta and Alford for Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations. SG has since moved to California.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/rights-coalition-seeks-to-block-additional-provisions-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] that a <a href = "http://www.azag.gov/LegalAZWorkersAct/">controversial Arizona employment law</a> [materials] is not preempted by the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text]. The law imposes penalties on businesses that hire illegal immigrants. Chief Justice Roberts delivered the first part of the opinion, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito, upholding the law as not explicitly preempted:<blockquote>Arizona's licensing law falls well within the confines of the authority Congress chose to leave to the States and therefore is not expressly preempted. While IRCA prohibits States from imposing "civil or criminal sanctions" on those who employ unauthorized aliens, it preserves state authority to impose sanctions "through licensing and similar laws." That is what the Arizona law does&#8212;it instructs courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of in-state employers that employ unauthorized aliens. The definition of "license" contained in the Arizona statute largely parrots the definition of "license" that Congress codified in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).</blockquote>The second part of the opinion, which Thomas did not join, declares the act not impliedly preempted. The third part, joined by the majority, declares that requiring the federally optional E-Verify program is not impliedly preempted. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the decision. Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, dissented, arguing that the licensing sanctions in the law are contrary to the intent of IRCA, and that the E-Verify program is not reliable enough to be mandatory. Justice Sonia Sotomayor also filed a dissent, focusing on Arizona creating separate mechanisms to determine whether a business has employed an unauthorized alien, and that the law forces a decision on the use of a federal resource, which she considers Congress' express power.

<p>IRCA precludes states from making significant laws on immigration. However, the commonly referred to "savings clause" "preempt(s) any State or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions (other than through licensing and similar laws) upon those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens." The Legal Arizona Workers Act "prohibits businesses from knowingly or intentionally hiring an 'unauthorized alien'" through requiring businesses to use several government programs, including E-Verify, to verify identities that are federally optional. If found employing unauthorized aliens, a business is subject to fines and a possible lose of license. E-Verify has been the subject of controversy due to inaccurate results showing legal immigrants as unauthorized aliens.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that under a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1512.html">federal witness tampering statute</a> [18 USC &#167; 1512(a)(1)(C) text] the government must show there was a reasonable likelihood the witness would communicate relevant information to federal officers. Charles Fowler was convicted of killing a local police officer who had caught him and a group of accomplices preparing to rob a bank. The 7-2 opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer rejected the government's proposed rule that it only must establish the murder was committed to prevent a possible or potential communication to federal officers. The court found this standard to weigh too heavily in favor of the government. Still, the court said it is not necessary to show that a relevant communication to federal officers was actually or intended to be made. The court said the intent requirement was whether the murder was made "to prevent" relevant communications:<blockquote>That is to say, where the defendant kills a person with an intent to prevent communication with law enforcement officers generally, that intent includes an intent to prevent communications with federal law enforcement officers only if it is reasonably likely under the circumstances that (in the absence of the killing) at least one of the relevant communications would have been made to a federal officer.</blockquote>The court remanded the case for application of its ruling. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred but filed a separate opinion arguing that the standard should be whether "the defendant intended to prevent a communication which, had it been made, would beyond a reasonable doubt have been made<em> to a federal law enforcement officer</em>." He agreed that the case should be remanded but said he would hold that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction since there was little evidence that the local police officer would have reported it to federal officers. Justices Samuel Alito and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented arguing that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because a rational jury could infer that Fowler had intent to prevent the local officer from communicating evidence to a spectrum of law enforcement officers including federal officers.

<p>At <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-5443.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-walmart-class-action-witness-tampering-law.php">report</a>] Fowler's counsel argued that the court should apply a narrower, "realistic likelihood" standard when determining if the victim would have provided information to federal authorities, rather than the government's vague, "reasonably possible" standard. The government responded that the reasonableness standard gives the jury discretion to determine whether a victim could have provided evidence to a federal agent, since it is not possible to know the "specific intent" of the deceased victim. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200815463.pdf">ruled</a> [decision, PDF] that Fowler violated the statute by killing the police officer. Fowler protested that prosecutors failed to establish that it was likely the officer would transfer information to federal investigators or that it was likely that a federal investigation would be opened. The court held, however, that prosecutors need only establish that the defendant killed the victim to prevent the communication of a possible federal offense and that they had met that burden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.southernenvironment.org/newsroom/press_releases/court_allows_environmental_challenges_to_post_oil_spill_leases_to_proceed/">Southern Environmental Law Center</a> and the <a href="http://www.defenders.org/index_v2.html">Defenders of Wildlife</a> [advocacy websites] claim that the <a href="http://www.boemre.gov/">Bureau of Ocean Energy, Management, and Enforcement</a> (BOEMRE) [official website], formerly the Minerals Management Service (MMS), violated the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National 
Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials] and the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/esa73.pdf">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) [text] by approving more 221 drilling licenses for the Gulf of Mexico after last year's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8651333.stm">Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">news archive</a>]. They argue that further licenses should not be granted until a new Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is prepared. The government argues that the claim is moot since it is already preparing a new EIS and that it is not ripe since there is no way to determine whether future lease sales will be approved based on the completed EIS. But the court held that the environmental groups are challenging leases that were already granted after the disaster in reliance on the now invalid EIS. The court also rejected the government's attempt to dismiss a claim that BOEMRE failed to insure that there was likely "no jeopardy" to endangered species. However, the court did dismiss one of the group's claims that BOEMRE violated the NEPA by a failure to reinitiate consultation by relevant government agencies in assessing the impact on endangered species because BOEMRE produced evidence that it had done just that. 

<p>Last January, the <a href="http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/">National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill</a> [official website] released its <a href="http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/final-report">full final report</a> [text], tracing the deeper root causes of the spill and recommending steps to avoid future incidents. The report highlights mistakes made by BP, as well as its partners <a href="http://www.halliburton.com">Haliburton</a> and <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean</a> [corporate websites], as the starting point that allowed the spill to take place, and finishes with recommendations based on those oversights. The report comes as another count against BP's practices leading up to the spill. In December, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/doj-sues-bp-over-gulf-oil-spill.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against units of BP and several other companies over the April 2010 disaster. The government's lawsuit is one of hundreds filed against BP and other companies in connection with the oil spill. In August, the <a href="http://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/index.html">US Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation</a> [official website] selected <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=2808&cid=999&ctype=na&instate=na">Judge Carl Barbier</a> [FJC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/louisiana-district-judge-to-preside-over-oil-spill-lawsuits.php">to hear</a> [JURIST report] more than 300 such lawsuits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, inspired by an <A href = "http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">Arizona law</a> [SB 1070 text; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Arizona+immigration">news archive</a>], requires individuals to provide proof of their legal status at all times, calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only and makes undocumented aliens ineligible for in-state tuition rates, financial aid, grants or scholarships. The ACLU argues this law will lead to warrantless arrests of authorized and unauthorized aliens, as well as racial profiling:<blockquote>Insofar as SEA 590 authorizes state and local law enforcement to arrest persons without reasonable suspicion or probable cause of any unlawful contact, much less criminal activity, it violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable seizures. SEA 590 also conflicts with and is preempted by the Immigration Nationality Act, which provides a comprehensive statutory framework for the regulation of immigration that among other things, contains detailed provisions governing the detention and release of non-citizens in removal proceedings.</blockquote>The suit is filed on behalf of three individuals who "will be" harassed by the law. State Senator <a href = "http://www.mikedelph.com">Mike Delph</a> [official website], the author of the law, responded <a href = "http://www.mikedelph.com/blog/2011/05/25/general/sen.-delph-responds-to-aclu-lawsuit-against-senate-enrolled-act-590/">condemning the lawsuit</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href = "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1511.pdf">restricted</a> [opinion, PDF] the use of the "inequitable conduct" defense for invalidating patents. Inequitable conduct previously allowed the judge to use his or her discretion in invalidating an otherwise valid patent if he or she believed the patent-holder had engaged in unfair practices when applying to the US <a href = "http://www.uspto.gov">Patent and Trademark Office</a> (PTO) [official website], contrary to <A href = "http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxr_1_56.htm">Rule 56</a> [text] of patent law. If it could be shown with clear and convincing evidence that the patent-holder withheld information, the patent would be found unenforceable. Sitting <em>en banc</em>, the court in <span class="casename">Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson and Co</span> limited this defense to when the patent-holder's bad acts were related directly to the patent, and they had the intent to deceive others.<blockquote>This court holds that, as a general matter, the materiality required to establish inequitable conduct is but-for materiality. When an applicant fails to disclose prior art to the PTO, that prior art is but-for material if the PTO would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art. Hence, in assessing the materiality of a withheld reference, the court must determine whether the PTO would have allowed the claim if it had been aware of the undisclosed reference. In making this patentability determination, the court should apply the preponderance of the evidence standard and give claims their broadest reasonable construction.</blockquote>Proving the intent requirement was also elevated to a "but-for" test. The court left an exception for egregious conduct not requiring the but-for standard that would render patents unenforceable.

<p>This case builds on the 2009 decision, <a href = "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/06-1491.pdf">Exergen Corp. v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and SAAT Systems</a> [text, PDF], which forced allegations of inequitable conduct to be pleaded specifically rather than generally. Any allegation must detail individuals' guilty inequitable conduct, the knowledge or information withheld or hidden from the PTO and how that conduct affected the patent application or the subsequent patent itself. This term, the US <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-sentence-reduction-patent-infringement-cases.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-6.pdf">Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB, SA</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF]. The court will determine whether the state of mind necessary for for a finding of inducing patent infringement is "deliberate indifference of a known risk" as proposed by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or "purposeful, culpable expression and conduct", as stated by the court in <A href = "http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2004/2004_04_480">MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.</a> [Oyez backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Dayton vetoed <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/?id=59&year=2011&type=0">Chapter 59</a> [text] of Minnesota House File 936, which would have banned all abortions after 20 weeks based on "substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by 20 weeks after fertilization." In Dayton's veto he said, "imposing civil penalties and making it a felony for a doctor to deliver care that is in the best interest of the patient is unconscionable." Dayton also vetoed <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/?id=56&year=2011&type=0">Chapter 56</a> [text] of House File 201, which mandated that public funding to state-sponsored cannot be used to provide abortions. The veto letter stated that the law:<blockquote>infringes on a woman's basic right to health and safety&#8212;a right every woman has, regardless of how she receives her health coverage. Our place is not between a woman and her doctor. The law already prescribes that state funding may only be used for abortions in cases of rape or incest, for health or therapeutic reasons, and when a woman's life is in danger. House File 201 would interfere with critical and difficult medical decisions.</blockquote>Dayton's campaign was <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/122612454.html">supported by abortion rights groups</a> [<em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em> report], and he was expected to issue the vetoes. 

<p>Earlier this week, a judge for the <a href = "http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-upholds-ohio-law-limiting-abortion-pill.php">upheld an Ohio law</a> that limits the use of the "abortion pill," overturning a 2006 <a href = "/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-rules-ohio-anti-abortion.php">injunction</a> [JURIST reports]. The law requires that the use of the pill, <a href = "http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm111323.htm">RU-486</a> [FDA guidelines], conform with federal guidelines, which currently do not allow the pill to be used after seven weeks of pregnancy. Oklahoma has also <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-3-anti-abortion.php">prohibited the use of RU-486</a> [JURIST report]. In April, the Ohio Senate <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would limit the availability of abortions after 20 weeks. That bill is pending in the House. <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports] have each passed legislation this year which restricts the abortion procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Also, earlier this year, a legislative committee in the Ohio House of Representatives <a href = "http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/03/30/abortion-bill-may-get-house-committee-vote-today.html?sid=101">advanced</a> [<em>Columbus Dispatch</em> report] the <a href = "http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/BillText129/129_HB_125_RH_Y.pdf">"Heartbeat Bill,"</a> [HB 125 text], which would ban abortions after the point at which a fetus's heartbeat becomes detectable in the womb.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill contains many controversial provisions such as prohibitions on the use of funds to transfer <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees to the US or other foreign countries, making it difficult for US President Barack Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">close</a> [JURIST report] the US Naval detention facility. Also on Thursday, the House passed an amendment to the bill <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll357.xml">246-173</a> [roll call vote] proposed by Representative <a href="http://buchanan.house.gov/">Vern Buchanan</a> (R-FL) [official website] to require all foreign terror suspects to be tried by military tribunals. The Obama administration issued a statement earlier this week threatening a veto if such a provision is in the bill. The statement said such a provision:<blockquote>is a dangerous and unprecedented challenge to critical Executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  It unnecessarily constrains our Nation's counterterrorism efforts and would undermine our national security, particularly where our Federal courts are the best&#8212;or even the only&#8212;option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.</blockquote>The bill also contains a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c112:2:./temp/~c112lBmZpg:e286772:">provision</a> [Sec. 533] that would delay the the repeal of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/654.html">Don't Ask Don't Tell</a> (DADT) [10 USC &#167; 654; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=don%27t+ask+don%27t+tell">news archive</a>], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/military-training-for-dont-ask-dont-tell-repeal-to-be-complete-midsummer.php">on track</a> [JURIST report] to be completely repealed by midsummer. The provision requires the chiefs of each military branch to provide written certification that the repeal of DADT be harmful to the "readiness, effectiveness, cohesion, and morale" of armed forces units. Laura Murphy, director of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] Washington Legislative Office, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights-national-security-religion-belief-reproductive-freedom/house-passes-bill-authorizing-wor">responded</a> [press release] to the DADT condition:<blockquote>Trying to throw a roadblock up to derail "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" repeal at this point is a desperate attempt to postpone the inevitable. For nearly 20 years, lesbian, gay and bisexual service members have been forced to hide who they are and who they love in order to serve their country. It was with the will of the president, the uniformed and civilian leadership of the military and Congress itself that [DADT] was repealed and its implementation will continue to move forward successfully despite the attempts by some House members to disrupt it.</blockquote>The bill <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jmF6Omrr0w8-vpzNiB7eS6AHUR5Q?docId=aa1fa2fab9684b2f89c17e796e0b5b93">must still be reconciled</a> [AP report] with the Senate version which the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Armed Forces Committee</a> [official website] will begin crafting on June 13. 

<p>Last January, Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/obama-signs-law-barring-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us-for-trial.php">signed the last defense authorization</a> [JURIST report] bill which also contained limits on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees.

Sumi, the judge who <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">temporarily enjoined the law</a> [JURIST report], clarified that her ruling is not on the legality of the law, but merely the violation of procedure. Wisconsin's <a href = "http://www.wisconsin.edu/gc-off/deskbook/woml.htm">open meetings law</a> [materials] requires, "24 hours' notice, or two hours' notice if 'good cause' is shown." She clarified that legislative privilege does not bar this requirement:<blockquote>This case is the exemplar of values protected by Open Meetings Law: transparency in government, the right of citizens to participate in their government, and respect for the rule of law. It is not this court's business to determine whether 2011 Wisconsin Act 11 is good public policy or bad public policy; that is the business of the Legislature. It is this court's responsibility, however, to apply the rule of law to the facts before it.</blockquote>Republican state Senator <a href = "http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/sen13/news/">Scott Fitzgerald</a> [official website] has been the only supporter of the law to <a href = "http://www.wbay.com/story/14734130/2011/05/26/senate-majority-leader-scott-fitzgerald-statement-on-judges-ruling">comment</a> [press release] on the ruling, saying: "There's still a much larger separation-of-powers issue: whether one Madison judge can stand in the way of the other two democratically-elected branches of government. The Supreme Court is going to have the ultimate ruling, and they're still scheduled to hear the issue on June 6."

<p>In March, Sumi <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-clarifies-ruling-blocking-union-bargaining-law.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] clarifying that the temporary restraining order prohibits not only publication of the bill, but implementation of its provisions as well. Sumi's order was issued in response to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-union-bargaining-bill-may-become-law-despite-judicial-order.php">debate among government officials</a> [JURIST report] that the law went into effect after it was published on the Wisconsin Legislative Bureau's website. The judge's temporary restraining order stemmed from a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed earlier in March month by District Attorney Ismael Ozanne claiming that Republican legislators passed the bill in violation of Wisconsin's open meetings law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The three men were <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/05/26/Former-Nazis-sentenced-in-Italy/UPI-77031306421323/">tried <em>in absentia</em> and sentenced to life imprisonment</a> [UPI report] for their parts in the massacre of 184 civilians in the village of Padule di Fucecchio in Tuscany on August 23, 1944. The killings of 94 mostly elderly men, 63 women and 27 children constituted one of the worst Nazi atrocities in Italy during the war. A year afterward Sgt. Charles Edmonson of the Special Investigations Branch became determined to find the perpetrators and took detailed accounts from witnesses. After Edmonson died in 1985 the statements were found in a cupboard in his home and later formed part of the prosecution's case against the three Germans. The ex-soldiers, 88, 91 and 94 years old, are not expected to serve time in prison because Germany is not required by law to release them into Italian custody. In addition to the life sentences, the court handed down an order for Germany to pay &#8364;12 million to surviving relatives of the victims, but Germany maintains it is not liable due to provisions of the <a href="http://www.ena.lu/peace_treaty_italy_10_february_1947-020302265.html">1947 Treaty of Peace</a> [materials] and the 1961 Bilateral Compensation Agreement for Victims of the Nazi Regime.

<p>A fourth defendant died during trial at the age of 100, a reminder that recent trials for Nazi atrocities will likely be some of the last. Earlier this month a Hungarian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-nazi-goes-on-trial-in-hungary.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of accused Nazi Sandor Kepiro, who was named as the world's most wanted Nazi war crimes suspect by the <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=6212365">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> (SWC) [advocacy website], a Jewish human rights organization committed to finding and prosecuting Holocaust war criminals. Also this month, a German court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Nazi guard <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>] for his role in murdering 28,000 at the Sobidor Death Camp. Demjanjuk, 91, was sentenced to five years in prison but released because of his advanced age and because appeals could take years. In November, Nazi guard <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profile.html?tx_jbtrial_pi2[tab]=facts&amp;tx_jbtrial_pi2[profile]=samuel_kunz_936">Samuel Kunz</a> [Trial Watch profile], 89, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/former-nazi-prison-guard-dies-while-awaiting-trial.php">passed away</a> [JURIST report] in his home before he could be brought to trial. He was accused of aiding in the killing of hundreds of thousands of Jewish people at the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/ar/belzec.html">Belzec concentration camp</a> [HRP backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ahmed al-Maghrabi was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/egypt-housing-jail-idUSLDE74P1PQ20110526">found guilty of illegal acquisition of state land</a> [Reuters report] for his part in the sale of the 18 acres of land to a prominent businessman, who was convicted in the same case and given a one-year suspended sentence. The public land was sold without auction and well below market value, in violation of a 1998 law. As a result, the two men were found guilty of wasting public funds and ordered to repay 72 million Egyptian pounds (USD $12.6 million) to the state for damaging public finances, and were then together fined an additional 72 million pounds. At this time Maghrabi also faces charges of profiteering and wasting public funds in another corruption suit involving a relative.

<p>Maghrabi is the third senior minister from the regime of ousted president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile] to be sentenced to a prison term. Earlier this month, an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-court-convicts-former-tourism-minister-for-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] the country's former tourism minister, Zoheir Garranah, for corruption and sentenced him to five years in prison. In April, Egyptian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/former-egypt-officials-charged-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former prime minister Ahmed Nazif, former finance minister Yousef Boutros and former interior minister Habib el Adly with corruption. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused the former president</a> [JURIST report] and the country's police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations. The joint commission submitted their report to Egypt's top prosecutor for further investigation. The Supreme Military Council of Egypt, which assumed power after Mubarak's resignation, instructed Egypt's top prosecutor to <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20110323/163161631.html">investigate the death of protesters</a> [RIA Novosti report] during the three weeks of demonstrations in the country. Last week Amnesty International reported that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">at least 840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report], and more than 6,000 were injured, during the Egyptian protests. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Serbian authorities  <A HREF = "http://www.icty.org/sid/10670">captured</A> [ICTY press release] Ratko Mladic on Thursday, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">ending a 16-year manhunt</a> [JURIST report] for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic's lawyer stated his client was not able to communicate well due to his fragile state, and the proceedings were then <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=26&nav_id=74562">suspended briefly</a>, but Mladic has been found <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=27&nav_id=74601">fit to stand trial</a> [B92 reports] and will be extradited to begin his hearings at the <a href = "http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. There have been no questions about his mental competence, as <a href = "http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/27/ratko-mladic-extradition-un-tribunal">he told his lawyer</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that "he is aware he is under arrest, he knows where he is, and he said he does not recognise The Hague tribunal." Mladic has three days to appeal the decision.

<p>Reactions continue to pour in around the world, many positive, but some wary. UN <a href = "www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5301">praised the arrest</a> [statement]: "This is a historic day for international justice and for the world's collective fight against impunity. It sends a powerful message that those who are alleged to have committed crimes against humanity may try to evade justice but they will, in the end, be held accountable." Fellow indicted war criminal, currently undergoing trial at the ICTY, <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Radovan+Karadzic">Radovan Karadzic</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hh8e5732q7QYVMt222s0qTBvTDPA?docId=7ebca320859f47b394c56983cac0c30f">said</a> [AP report], "President Karadzic is sorry for Gen. Mladic's loss of freedom and he looks forward to working with him to bring out the truth about what happened in Bosnia." Russian officials have expressed tepid approval of the arrest, but pointed out <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=27&nav_id=74599">alleged inconsistencies in the ICTY trials</a> [B92 report] and hoped Mladic would be treated fairly. <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=27&nav_id=74579">Demonstrations began Thursday night in Serbia</a> [B92 report], with approximately 700 people protesting Mladic's arrest. Belgrade authorities have ordered a ban on public gatherings in reaction. The <a href = "http://www.srpskaradikalnastranka.org.rs/">Serb Radical Party</a> (SRS) [political website, in Serbian] <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=27&nav_id=74599">announced</a> [press release, in Serbian] a rally for Mladic on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mladic was one of the two remaining at-large war criminals sought by the ICTY, along with Goran Hadzic. Mladic faces <a href = "http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/ind/en/mla-ai021010e.pdf">charges</a> [amended indictment, PDF] of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the <a href = "/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">massacre of Srebrenica</a> during the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archives]. In December, the First Municipal Court in Belgrade <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/serbia-court-acquits-10-accused-of-aiding-war-crimes-suspect-mladic.php">acquitted 10 men</a> [JURIST report] suspected of helping Mladic evade arrest. In September, ICTY prosecutor <a href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] <A href = "/paperchase/2010/09/icty-prosecutor-urges-greater-effort-to-arrest-war-crimes-suspect-mladic.php">called on Serbia and other governments</a> [JURIST report] to increase efforts to find and arrest Mladic. Brammertz said failure to arrest Mladic would send war criminals the message that if they avoid capture long enough, the world will cease to care about bringing them to justice. Brammertz also emphasized the importance of seeking justice for Mladic's victims. Authorities must work quickly to arrest Mladic, Brammertz noted, since the ICTY is scheduled to be shut down in three years. Last May, Mladic's family filed a claim in the Belgrade District Court <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/mladic-family-seeks-official-death-declaration.php">seeking to have him declared officially dead</a> [JURIST report] in order to collect his state pension and sell his property. Earlier that month, the ICTY announced that the Office of the Prosecutor filed a motion to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-amend-mladic-indictment.php">amend the indictment against Mladic</a> [JURIST report] to include 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in order to help speed up court proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill passed the US <a href = "http://www.senate.gov">Senate</a> [official website] <A href = "http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&session=1&vote=00084">72-23</a> [roll call vote], and shortly after passed the US <a href = "http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] by a vote of <a href = "http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll376.xml">250-153</a> [roll call vote]. Although major congressional leaders of both parties had <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/us-congressional-leaders-agree-to-extend-patriot-act-through-2015.php">agreed to a clean extension of the act</a> [JURIST report] last week, delays were met when Senator <a href = "http://paul.senate.gov/">Rand Paul</a> (R-KY) [official website] filibustered the bill over the lack of an amendment process and serious concerns about privacy. After three days of filibustering, Paul received votes on two amendments that ultimately failed, both related to the ability of security officials to survey gun purchases. Controversial provisions renewed include provisions allowing the government to use roving wiretaps on multiple carriers and electronic devices and allowing the government to gain access to certain records relevant to its investigations. The "lone wolf" provision enables investigators to get warrants to conduct surveillance over targets not connected to any particular terrorist group.

<p>Last February, the House <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/house-passes-short-term-patriot-act-extension.php">passed a short-term extension</a> until May 27 of the controversial surveillance provisions after they were set to expire on February 28, two days after the Senate <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/senate-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] the bill by an 86-12 vote. Earlier that week, a simple majority of the House <A href = "/paperchase/2011/02/house-votes-to-extend-controversial-patriot-act-surveillance-provisions.php">approved a similar bill</a> that would have extended the three provisions until December after it had <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/patriot-act-extension-fails-in-house.php">failed</a> [JURIST reports] the prior week under a special rule that required a two-thirds majority. Prior to that vote, the Obama administration released a <A href = "http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/USEOPWHPO/2011/02/08/file_attachments/16366/SAP_on_H.R._514.pdf">statement of administration policy</a> [text, PDF] vying for a three-year renewal of the provisions. The provisions were <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/congress-approves-patriot-act-extension.php">extended in February 2010</a> after the Obama administration asked the Senate Judiciary Committee to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/09/doj-supports-reauthorization-of.php">extend</a> [JURIST reports] the Patriot Act. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found violations to Articles 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment) and 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the <a href = "http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text].<blockquote>Because the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy had a profound effect on a woman's private life, including her physical and moral integrity, any interference with this decision must be analysed in light of the woman's right to privacy. This was true regardless of whether the interference directly affected the woman's access to legal abortion or affected it indirectly, by denying her the prerequisite healthcare she needed in order to make a decision regarding continuation or termination of the pregnancy. Numerous international conventions broadly recognised a woman's right to the highest attainable standard of health, including access to appropriate reproductive care. Privacy was particularly important in the case of sexual and reproductive healthcare, which must be provided in a manner consistent with women's rights to personal autonomy.</blockquote>RR, the plaintiff, was pregnant and after several ultrasounds, believed her child to be "malformed." Signifying her intent to have an abortion if the child was disabled, she requested an amniocentesis. Her doctor refused both to perform the genetic test and to abort RR's fetus. She was also informed the hospital in question had refused to perform abortions for 150 years. After several more attempts to get an abortion were thwarted, RR gave birth to a girl with Turner syndrome. RR is to receive 45,000 euros in non-pecuniary damage and 15,000 euros for costs and expenses from Poland. Either party has three months to appeal to the Grand Chamber of the Court.

<p>The ECHR has previously been called to rule on abortion rights in its signatory countries. In December, the ECHR <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/europe-rights-court-rules-against-ireland-abortion-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Ireland failed to provide "effective and accessible procedures" to allow a Lithuanian women to assert her constitutional right to a lawful abortion. In 2007, Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski declared that Poland <a href = "/paperchase/2007/06/poland-to-appeal-echr-abortion-ruling.php">planned to appeal</a> a <a href = "/paperchase/2006/02/polish-woman-refused-abortion.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] by the ECHR that found Poland in violation of Article 8 for prohibiting a pregnant woman who had a serious risk of vision loss if she carried the pregnancy to term from obtaining an abortion. The ECHR <A HREF = "/paperchase/2007/10/echr-affirms-rejection-of-poland.php">rejected this appeal</a> [JURIST report], reinforcing that the Polish government did not provide any procedural framework to resolve a dispute concerning whether a medical exception should be granted, or to facilitate "effective mechanisms capable of determining whether the conditions for obtaining a lawful abortion had been met." <a href = "http://www.kaveity.nl/professionals/Gerolf_Hagens.htm">Gerolf Hagens</a> [professional profile] has <a href = "/hotline/2011/01/on-november-4th-1950-the.php">analyzed</a> [JURIST comment] the ECHR's rulings on abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A fifth pirate pleaded guilty and was tried separately. The five men were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/south-korea-charges-5-captured-somali-pirates.php">charged</a> with hijacking, maritime robbery and six other crimes, and they <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/four-accused-somali-pirates-go-on-trial-in-south-korea.php">went on trial</a> [JURIST reports] earlier this week. Mahomed Araye was <a href = "http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/05/117_87840.html">sentenced to life imprisonment</a> [<em>Korea Times</em> report] for an attempt to kill the captain of the ship, while the other three were sentenced to 13 to 15 years in prison. The defense claimed Araye did not attempt to kill the captain, and no one saw him fire the shots. Lawyers for the defense said they <a href = "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/1131656/1/.html">intend to appeal</a> [AFP report].

<p>This month, 10 pirates involved in hijacking a yacht, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/two-more-somali-pirates-plead-guilty-in-us-court.php">pleaded guilty</a> in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/somali-pirate-pleads-guilty-in-us-court.php">Virginia</a> [JURIST reports]. Spain's National Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/spain-court-sentences-somali-pirates-to-439-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Somali pirates to 439 years in prison each for their involvement in the 2009 hijacking of a Spanish fishing boat off the coast of Somalia. Last month, a US district court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-sentences-somali-pirate-to-25-years-in-prison.php">sentenced a Somali pirate to 25 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for his role in attacking a Danish ship, as well as the US Navy's USS Ashland. In November, a federal jury in Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-jury-convicts-5-somali-pirates.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] five Somali men on charges of piracy for their roles in an April attack on the USS Nichols. In August, piracy charges against six defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-dismisses-piracy-charges-against-6-somalis.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] when federal Judge Raymond Jackson ruled that piracy, as defined by the law of nations, does not include violence or aggression committed on the high seas, and rejected the government's argument for an expanded reading of the statute. Piracy remains an issue of international concern, as few countries have been willing to prosecute suspected pirates. The few that have attempted to do so include <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/germany-court-opens-countrys-first-piracy-trial-in-400-years.php">Germany</a>, <a href="paperchase/2010/07/seychelles-court-convicts-somali-pirates.php">Seychelles</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/dutch-court-sentences-somalia-pirates-to-5-years-in-prison.php">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/mauritius-to-try-accused-somali-pirates.php">Mauritius</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/yemen-court-sentences-12-pirates-6-to-death.php">Yemen</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/somalia-judge-known-for-sentencing.php">Somalia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/spain-judge-releases-underage-somali.php">Spain</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] in March, is set to take effect July 1 and would impose the longest waiting period in the country. The groups filed suit in the <a href="https://www.sdd.uscourts.gov/drupal6/">US District Court for the District of South Dakota</a> [official website] seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional. According to the complaint:<blockquote>If the Act takes effect, it will deny, among other things, Plaintiffs' patients their constitutional right to decide whether to have a child, as well as their patients' and physicians' First Amendment freedoms and their patients' right to informational privacy; and subject Plaintiffs and their physicians to significant licensing penalties, including revocation of Planned Parenthood's license to operate a health care facility in Sioux Falls and its physicians' licenses to practice medicine, as well as criminal and civil penalties. To avoid this irreparable harm, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the Act.</blockquote>South Dakota law already requires that women wait 24 hours and be offered the opportunity to view a sonogram before undergoing an abortion procedure.

<p>Several other states have also acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. Earlier this week, Minnesota <a href="http://markdayton.org/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks.

The law, designed to reform Vermont's entire health care system, will regulate health insurance premiums and health care provider payments, putting providers on a budget and rewarding them for efficiency, rather than a "fee-for-service" structure.<blockquote>As provided in Sec. 4 of this act, upon receipt by the state of necessary waivers from federal law, all Vermont residents shall be eligible for Green Mountain Care, a universal health care program that will provide health benefits through a single payment system. To the maximum extent allowable under federal law and waivers from federal law, Green Mountain Care shall include health coverage provided under the health benefit exchange established under chapter 18, subchapter 1 of Title 33; under Medicaid; under Medicare; by employers that choose to participate; and to state employees and municipal employees.</blockquote>Although the law is signed, the plan to fully implement and finance single-payer health care will not be completed until 2014 at the earliest. Shumlin acknowledged that people have questions, and stated the next steps to universal health care will not be taken without the approval of Vermonters.

<center><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Rk6YcQB2JpA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>The law also creates a state health insurance exchange. Some have <A href = "http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110526/NEWS03/110526013/Gov-Shumlin-signs-health-care-reform-bill-?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE">criticized the law</a> [<em>Burlington Press</em> report] for eventually destroying private health insurance and being impossible to fund. Others suggest it will <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/us-vermont-health-idUSTRE74P89420110526">save</a> [Reuters] $580 million annually, and $1.9 billion by 2019.

<p>Unlike the national <a href = "http://jurist.org/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [HR 3590; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>], the Vermont law guarantees state health insurance to every citizen, whereas the PPACA has a mandate for every citizen to purchase health insurance of some form, likely private unless they are eligible for Medicare. Court challenges to the PPACA continue across the nation. Last week, the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) sought <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/aclj-appeals-dismissal-of-health-care-reform-lawsuit.php">reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] of its dismissed lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the health care reform law. In April, the US <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-rejects-virginias-petition-for-expedited-review-of-health-care-law.php">Supreme Court denied</a> [JURIST report] Virginia's request for the court to rule on the constitutionality of the health care reform law on an expedited basis. A judge for the US District Court for the District of New Jersey <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-healthcare-reform-act.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, on jurisdictional grounds of <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/standing">standing</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], similar to a <A href = "/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-challenge.php">dismissal</a> [JURIST report] in the US District Court for the District of New Hampshire. A judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">struck down the law in January</a>, while in October, a judge in Michigan <a href = "/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">upheld the law</a> [JURIST report]. US Courts of Appeal for the Third, Sixth and Fourth circuits are all hearing oral arguments in appeals of lower court rulings, while appeals are pending in the DC circuit as well as the Eighth and Ninth circuits.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Scheinin, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, called for <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11066&LangID=E">accountability</a> [full statement] for "human rights violations committed in the name of counter-terrorism" and encouraged Tunisia to "continue to investigate ex officio allegation of torture and illegal detention." Scheinin's remarks come at the end of a five-day tour of the country. Despite assurances that the abusive anti-terrorism law had not been used since <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">ousting former president Ben Ali</a> [JURIST report], the UN expert found that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jL9FSv93L8KAXAeEJtLwJcYnPOmg?docId=CNG.80b23b06b8797cf929365dd8d249e49a.f51">judges still detain people under the 2003 law</a> [AFP report] which requires little evidence. Scheinin urged continued progress:<blockquote>Changes in the way Tunisia's security organs operate should not be limited to slogans, but should result in concrete measures. The first steps have been taken to establish accountability for those who attacked the demonstrators in January of this year. I welcome this positive development, but want to stress that in order to look truly forward towards a new Tunisia, it has to come to terms with dark remnants of its past. ... Investigating, prosecuting and trying those responsible for the crimes in question can also help rebuilding trust between the population and the security forces in the country.</blockquote>Scheinin offered to assist Tunisia in replacing the 2003 law with a counterterrorism framework that complies with international law. 

<p>Last month, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] released the <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htmhttp://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials] noting the recent uprising in Tunisia had an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">ambiguous impact on human rights</a> [JURIST report]. In February, the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tunisia-calls-for-saudi-arabia-to-extradite-ousted-president.php">formal request to extradite former the president</a> [JURIST report] following the filing of additional charges. Also in February, <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on the Tunisian transitional government to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/29/tunisia-hold-police-accountable-shootings">investigate incidents of police violence against protesters</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/01/31/tunisia-end-police-attacks-protesters">end police brutality</a> [HRW reports; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hrw-calls-for-end-to-police-violence-in-tunisia-protests.php">report</a>], and the UN reported that at least 219 died as a result of the protests, including 72 killed in prison riots.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The OHCHR's concerns follow escalated violence that has claimed more than 100 lives since <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> [official website, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=\%22Ali+Abdullah+Saleh\%22">news archive </a>] on Monday <a href="http://mediascrape.com/all-posts/world-news/yemeni-president-ali-abdullah-saleh-refuses-to-step-down-gunfire-ensues-al-jazeers-video/">refused</a> [Al Jazeera video] for the third time to sign a pact that will transfer power to his deputy and end his 32-year reign as the nation's leader. In April, Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down</a> [JURIST report] within 30 days of signing an agreement brokered by the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> [official website], a group of six nations from the region, in exchange for immunity for Saleh and his family from any prosecution. Saleh refused to sign the agreement on Monday because the opposition party did not come to his palace and sign the agreement in his presence. Saleh believes a public signing is imperative because the opposition party will be part of the interim government once he steps down. Outrage in the streets of Yemen has since escalated to violence, and the OHCHR has called on the Yemeni government to crack down on the excessive and disproportionate use of force against protesters. The UN is concerned that continued violence will not only bring the country to war, but cause large numbers of citizens to flee Yemen which could result in major humanitarian issues. 

<p>Violence and human rights abuses have been pressing issues in several Middle Eastern nations where protests have erupted. Last week, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-officials-concerned-over-middle-east-rights-violations.php">UN expressed concern over Middle Eastern rights violations</a> [JURIST report]  after reports were released that in Syria alone 850 people had been killed since the demonstrations began in March. Concern for violence in Yemen surfaced when Saleh requested the Yemeni Parliament end anti-government protests by <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">enacting new emergency laws</a> that gave the government greater power to arrest and detain protesters and to censor the media. In April, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">two human rights organizations criticized Bahrain</a> [JURIST report] for rampant human rights abuses that related to using the emergency law to trample on human rights and create a state of fear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfederalcourtruling.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Memorandum-Opinion.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] a campaign finance law which bans corporations from making contributions to federal candidates, citing the controversial Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html">Citizens United</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>]. Judge James Cacheris dismissed a criminal count against two men charged with illegally <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/va-judge-rules-against-us-ban-on-direct-corporate-contributions-to-candidates/2011/05/27/AGEPEpCH_story.html">reimbursing individuals for almost $200,000 in contributions</a> [WP report] to Hillary Clinton's 2006 senate and 2008 presidential primary campaign. In dismissing the count, Cacheris stated that <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> had dissolved the legal underpinnings for the federal ban against direct contributions from corporations to a candidate:<blockquote>For better or worse, Citizens United held that there is no distinction between an individual and a corporation with respect to political speech. ... Corporations and human beings are entitled to equal political speech rights. ... Thus, if an individual can make direct contributions within [the law's] limits, a corporation cannot be banned from doing the same thing.</blockquote>Federal prosecutors have not indicated whether they will file a motion to reconsider the ruling, which seems probable.

<p>Commentators have noted that judge Cacheris' opinion does not address the 2003 Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-403.ZS.html">Federal Election Commission v.

Although Cacheris does acknowledge that another federal judge ruled on the same question but upheld the law, his opinion is silent on the Eighth Circuit's appellate ruling likewise upholding the ban. Cecheris' ruling does not follow the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hFFXHfh0tnIHWKcr6uJHTpaLmuJg?docId=15e08682c72a44f786d8aee89f86a8e4">distinction between expenditures and contributions</a> [AP report] upheld by the Eighth Circuit. Despite strong reactions to the ruling, the net impact is unclear because current election law limit individuals to $2,500 per candidate in each election, while corporate political action committees may contribute up to $5,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Madhwani challenged the denial of  2004 petition for writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> by the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] claiming that there was insufficient evidence to find that he was part of al Qaeda and that the district court improperly relied on evidence outside the record, abused its discretion in denying additional discovery and committed various legal errors, including due process violations. The court supported the use of the "command structure" test employed by the district court as "sufficient to show that a person is part of al Qaeda" in response to Madhwani's arguments against using an erroneous legal standard where only preponderance of evidence is needed to detain someone in connection with al Qaeda. Examining the evidence <em>de novo</em>, the appeals court found that:<blockquote>In light of Madhwani's guesthouse and military training camp admissions, his carrying a rifle at the behest of camp superiors, his suspicious movements and implausible narrative and his final capture in the company of at least one known al-Qaida operative, we conclude that a preponderance of the evidence unmistakably showed Madhwani was "part of" al-Qaida when he was captured. In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, Madhwani offers a laundry list of evidentiary and legal complaints. None establishes a convincing basis for us to reverse the district court's denial of habeas corpus relief.</blockquote>Madhwani remains at the Guantanamo detention facility.

<p><em>Habeas corpus</em> rights for Guantanamo detainees have been a struggle for federal courts this past year. In March, an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-appeals-court-overturns-release-order-for-yemeni-guantanamo-detainee.php">blocked the release</a> [JURIST report] of Guantanamo detainee Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman by <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/727BF5F867C51399852578620051FD30/$file/10-5235-1300403.pdf">overturning</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court decision that claimed the government had failed to prove prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Uthman had received and executed orders from al Qaeda. In September, Kuwaiti Guantanamo detainee Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad al Odah <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Al-Odah-cert-petition-9-28-10.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guantanamo-detainee-appeals-to-supreme-court-for-habeas-relief.php">report</a>] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reverse a federal appeals court decision that denied him <em>habeas corpus</em> relief. The DC appeals court <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201007/09-5331-1253722.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainee-al-odahs-habeas-petition.php">report</a>] <em>habeas corpus</em> relief to al Odah in July. The court affirmed the district court's <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv0828-639">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-denies-al-odah-guantanamo.php">report</a>] that there was sufficient evidence against al Odah for him to be considered "part of" al Qaeda and Taliban forces. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The measure <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110529/local/the-sun-is-shining.367870">passed with 53 percent of the vote</a>, and saw a <a href="http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110528/local/voter-turnout-at.367704">72 percent turnout</a> [<em>Times of Malta</em> reports] among the predominantly Catholic 412,966 residents, the lowest turnout in its recent history. The archipelago nation is the last EU member state not to allow divorce. Under current Maltese law, a couple could apply for a court ordered legal separation or seek an annulment through the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm">Catholic Church</a> [official website]. Foreign divorces are also recognized. The vote was called after <a href="http://www.parlament.mt/file.aspx?f=11740">legislation</a> [text, PDF] to allow divorce was introduced in the <a href="http://www.gov.mt/frame.asp?l=1&url=http://www.parliament.gov.mt">House of Representatives</a> [official website]. Although non-binding, Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi, an opponent of legalized divorce, stated that his government would <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13588834">move to pass legislation</a> [BBC report] in line with the referendum question, which read:<blockquote>Do you agree with the introduction of the option of divorce in the case of a married couple who has been separated or has been living apart for at least four (4) years, and where there is no reasonable hope for reconciliation between the spouses, whilst adequate maintenance is guaranteed and the children are protected?</blockquote>Proponents of the "yes" vote argued that it was necessary to reduce the influence of the church in Maltese government and to respect civil rights. Opponents argued that it would encourage the breakup of families and increase separation rates. The change will leave Vatican City and the Philippines the last two countries in with the world that do not allow divorce.

<p>Chile was the last country to transition to legalized divorce in 2004 when its <a href="/paperchase/2004/11/chile-grants-first-legal-divorce.php">new marital code went into effect</a> [JURIST report], replacing the code that had been in force since 1884. The new law permits divorce in the case of breach of marital duties, such as infidelity or domestic violence, or after a period of separation whose length depends on whether one party or both wish to end the marriage. Malta's vote comes a year after the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] proposed reforms to simplify and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/eu-proposes-simplified-international.php">clarify international divorce laws</a> [JURIST report]. Under the proposal, married couples from different EU countries could choose the country of the divorce, and the various courts would use a common formula to decide which country's law applies when a couple disagrees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit was filed Thursday in the <a href="http://www.scscourt.org/">Superior Court of California</a> [official website] following the unveiling of <a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/">Google Wallet</a> [service website] a mobile payment system to be utilized by Google's Android phone line. The suit centers on two former PayPal employees, Osama Bedier and Stephanie Tilenius, who PayPal claims were poached by Google following the breakdown of three-year negotiations to make PayPal the payment system of the Android phones. The lawsuit further alleges that Bedier had given Google confidential documents relating to PayPal's mobile payment strategies and willfully and maliciously shared his knowledge of the company's trade secrets after leaving PayPal, violating California <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&group=03001-04000&file=3426-3426.11">state law</a> [Cal. Civ. Code &#167; 3426 <em>et seq.</em>]. The lawsuit also alleges that Tilenius assisted in recruiting Bedier from PayPal, violating contractual obligations requiring her to refrain from doing so for a year after her departure from the company. The lawsuit also alleges that Google violated <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/BPC/1/d7/2/5">state law prohibiting unfair business practices</a> [Cal. BPC. Code &#167; 17200 <em>et seq.</em>]. In response, Google <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/google-responds-to-paypal-lawsuit-people-have-the-right-to-seek-better-jobs/2011/05/27/AGy7wlCH_story.html">emphasized that it respects trade secrets</a> [WP report] and that state law and public policy recognize people's ability to seek better employment opportunities.  

<p>In recent years, Google has been the subject of litigation worldwide. In March, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/en/us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> [corporate website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/microsoft-to-file-anti-competition-complaint-against-google-in-europe.php">file a formal complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the European Commission (EC) detailing alleged anticompetitive practices by Google. Google has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/eu-announces-antitrust-probe-into-google-business-practices.php">facing an ongoing investigation</a> [JURIST report] by the EC over allegations of manipulation of search results to highlight Google's own products and services. The company has faced separate antitrust inquiries in Italy, Germany and France in addition to the EC probe, in which Microsoft-owned Bing subsidiary Caio was one of the original complainants. Microsoft's announcement came the same day the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">announced a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the company over charges that it breached consumer privacy rights and was misleading during the launch of its social networking platform, <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz">Google Buzz</a> [service website]. These reports came a week after a New York court ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-rejects-google-books-settlement.php">rejecting a proposed settlement</a> [JURIST report] in the 2005 suit brought by authors and publishers over the Google Book Search project.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Serbian authorities <a href="http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/world/europe/mladic-lawyer-says-he-has-filed-appeal/article_2e15e898-3bb8-5fb2-997a-0c3a9d41bf54.html">must postpone Mladic's extradition</a> [AP report] until the court reviews the appeal, which formally requests that independent physicians, including cardiologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedists and gastroenterologists, be granted access to <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=05&dd=30&nav_id=74647">assess Mladic's condition</a> [B92 report]. Saljic believes Mladic's health is sufficiently poor to merit blocking extradition and, in turn, Mladic's hearings at the <a href="http://www.icty.org">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. There have been no questions about Mladic's mental competence, as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/27/ratko-mladic-extradition-un-tribunal">he told Saljic</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that he understands his circumstances and that he rejects the tribunal's authority. Serbian authorities <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10670">captured</a> [ICTY press release] Mladic last week, ending a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">16-year manhunt</a> [JURIST report] for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

<p>Mladic was one of the two remaining at-large war criminals sought by the ICTY, along with Goran Hadzic. Mladic faces <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/ind/en/mla-ai021010e.pdf">charges</a> [amended indictment, PDF] of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">massacre of Srebrenica</a> during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archives]. In December, the First Municipal Court in Belgrade <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/serbia-court-acquits-10-accused-of-aiding-war-crimes-suspect-mladic.php">acquitted 10 men</a> [JURIST report] suspected of helping Mladic evade arrest. In September, ICTY prosecutor <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/99">Serge Brammertz</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/icty-prosecutor-urges-greater-effort-to-arrest-war-crimes-suspect-mladic.php">called on Serbia and other governments</a> [JURIST report] to increase efforts to find and arrest Mladic. Last May, Mladic's family filed a claim in the Belgrade District Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/mladic-family-seeks-official-death-declaration.php">seeking to have him declared officially dead</a> [JURIST report] in order to collect his state pension and sell his property. The ICTY announced earlier that month that the Office of the Prosecutor filed a motion to <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-amend-mladic-indictment.php">amend the indictment against Mladic</a> [JURIST report] to include 11 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war in order to help speed up court proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Heyns' conclusions are based on analysis by <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5igVFEjqb-wzAx_JfWWkSHn3TcsBQ?docId=CNG.457a26ab62ddf88061e8abe5baa61c04.821">technical and forensic experts</a> [AFP report], including pathologists, video analysts and a firearms expert, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-expert-urges-sri-lanka-war.php">echo findings</a> [JURIST report] that led his predecessor last year to call for an independent investigation into Sri Lankan war crimes. Heyns, however, reviewed a longer version of the video than his predecessor. The Sri Lankan government has strongly denied the video's authenticity, calling it a fraud perpetrated by the LTTE.

<p>A UN panel of experts said in a report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">released</a> [JURIST report] last month that the parties on both sides may have committed war crimes during the final stages of the 26-year civil war between the Sri Lankan government and rebel LTTE forces. The Sri Lankan <a href="http://www.mea.gov.lk/">Ministry of External Affairs</a> [official website] announced in December that the three-person panel would be <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/sri-lanka-to-allow-un-war-crimes-panel-visit.php">allowed to visit</a> [JURIST report] the island to investigate alleged war crimes. The decision represented a reversal after months of <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/sri-lanka-to-refuse-un-panel-entry.php">strong opposition</a> [JURIST report] from the Sri Lankan government under <a href="http://www.president.gov.lk/index.php">President Mahinda Rajapaksa</a> [official profile], who described the UN panel as an infringement on Sri Lanka's sovereignty. Rajapaksa instead appointed the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) to investigate the final years of the conflict from the ceasefire in 2002 to its conclusion in 2009. The LLRC's credibility, however, has been contested by several human rights organizations, which contend that the <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lanka-allows-un-panel-to-visit-colombo/137842-2.html">commission lacks objectivity</a> [PTI report]. The government has repeatedly denied accusations that its forces violated international law during the conflict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The penalties raise the prison sentences and eliminate the caps on fines and raises penalties for public officials found to have protected violators or taken bribes from them. The penalties for violators may even include the death penalty if the violation results in the someone's death. The SPC said that food safety incidents are endangering many lives. One major problem is <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/video/2011-05/26/c_13895206.htm">using melamine as a milk additive</a> [Xinhua report] to raise protein levels.

There have also been problems with the recycling of old, moldy buns by steaming them and adding chemicals to make them seem fresh. 

<p>The problem of tainted Chinese milk is not subsiding, despite Chinese government promises to the contrary and <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-legislature-approves-new-food.php">attempts at reform</a> [JURIST report]. Last September, police in China's Shanxi province in <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/seven-arrested-in-china-for-melamine-tainted-powdered-milk.php">arrested seven individuals</a> [JURIST report], including the executive of a dairy company, after that company's powdered milk was found to contain melamine. In July 2010, Chinese authorities discovered <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-07/09/c_13392414.htm">64 tons of raw dairy materials</a> [Xinhua report] contaminated with melamine in Qinghai province. In February, Chinese police <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-police-arrest-3-for-involvement.php">arrested three individuals</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 2008 tainted milk scandal. Two other individuals were <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/china-executes-two-men-for-roles-in.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009 after being convicted of endangering public safety and selling toxic food.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court will hear <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-8974.htm">Perry v. New Hampshire</a> [docket], in which Barion Perry is <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/05/31/2243360/court-to-clarify-witness-identification.html">challenging his conviction</a> [AP report] for breaking into a car based on a witness identifying him as the perpetrator while he was in handcuffs under police custody. The witness claims she saw Perry break into the car and steal things but later could neither pick him out of a photo line-up nor describe his appearance. Perry argues that the identification was suggestive since he was in handcuffs, making him look like a criminal. The appeal comes after the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld Perry's conviction. 

<p>The Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1038.htm">Black v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/10-1038.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] in which Black was seeking to have his remaining conviction overturned. Black was originally convicted on two counts of fraud and a third count of obstruction of justice after a jury acquitted him and his co-defendants of 15 other fraud counts. He appealed to the Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-holds-publicity-did-not-prevent-fair-trial-in-enron-case.php">remanded</a> [JURIST report] the case to the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] to apply a different standard for the two fraud counts. The Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-2-of-4-conrad-black-convictions.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] the conviction for the fraud counts but left intact the obstruction of justice claim. Black argued that in applying the incorrect standard to the fraud counts had created error that should overturn his conviction on the remaining count because of the relation of the charges. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the decision to deny <em>certiorari</em>. Black said that he was <a href="http://www.canadianbusiness.com/article/28436--conrad-black-not-surprised-by-supreme-court-rejection-of-his-case">not surprised</a> [<em>Canadian Business</em> report] that the Supreme Court did not take another look at his case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

SEB, SA</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-sentence-reduction-patent-infringement-cases.php">report</a>] that induced patent infringement requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement. Under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_271.htm">35 USC &#167; 271(b)</a> [text], a patent owner may bring suit against an individual "who actively induces infringement of a patent." The petitioners stood accused of inducing infringement of a patented deep fryer produced by SEB. The trial court allowed the issue to go to the jury, denying petitioners' motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the presentation of evidence, even though petitioners had no knowledge of SEB's patent. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed, using the "deliberate indifference to a known risk" standard. In a majority opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the court rejected the "deliberate indifference" standard, but nonetheless affirmed the judgment below:<blockquote>[W]e agree that deliberate indifference to a known risk that a patent exists is not the appropriate standard under &#167;271(b). We nevertheless affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals because the evidence in this case was plainly sufficient to support a finding of Pentalpha&#8217;s knowledge under the doctrine of willful blindness.</blockquote>Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a dissenting opinion. 

<p>SEB owns a patent for a deep fryer. In 1997, Pentalpha, a subsidiary of Global-Tech Appliances, developed and manufactured a deep fryer that copied features of SEB's deep fryer. In 1999, SEB sued Global-Tech for patent infringement in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The jury found Global-Tech liable for direct and active inducement of patent infringement, and Global-Tech appealed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Abdullah Al-Kidd argued that his arrest prior to flying to Saudi Arabia was unconstitutional since it was made for an improper motive. The court ruled 8-0, with four concurrences, to reverse and remand the decision by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website]. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself. The opinion of the court by Justice Antonin Scalia held that the warrant was objectively reasonable pursuant to the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3144.html">material witness statute</a> [18 USC &#167; 3144 text] and could not be challenged for improper motive. Scalia further held that former US attorney general <a href="/currentawareness/ashcroft.php">John Ashcroft</a> [JURIST news archive] was entitled to absolute immunity because he did not violate any clearly established law. Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion, which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined in part, agreeing with the opinion of the court but making two observations. First, that the ruling leaves unresolved whether the government's use of the material witness statute in this case was lawful. Second, that actions of national office holders must be given deference for qualified immunity purposes where the law of different jurisdictions conflicts, especially when the action taken was consistent with the laws of the jurisdiction where it occurred. Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor questioned whether the warrant was "validly obtained" if the government failed to disclose to the judicial magistrate issuing the warrant that it had no intention to use al-Kidd as a witness, that he and his family are naturally-born US citizens, and that he in fact had a round-trip flight to Saudi Arabia. Ginsburg further noted that his harsh treatment and detention after being arrested "is a grim reminder of the need to install safeguards against disrespect for human dignity, constraints that will control officialdom even in perilous times."

<p>Ashcroft appealed the <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/ninth-circuit-rules-no-ashcroft.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that <a href="http://www.aele.org/law/Digests/jail18.html">absolute</a> and <a href="http://www.aele.org/law/Digests/jail21.html">qualified</a> [AELE backgrounders] immunity do not shield him from the suit. During <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-ashcroft-immunity-confrontation-clause-cases.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report], counsel for Ashcroft argued that the appellate court's ruling is contrary to precedent that states that intent plays no role in finding that absolute immunity applies to traditional prosecutorial functions, such as issuing material witness warrants. He also argued that, regardless of the finding on absolute immunity, qualified immunity protects officials unless their actions violate constitutional rights, which Ashcroft argues does not occur by using a material witness warrant in a pretextual manner. Counsel for respondent, an American citizen who was detained pursuant to a material witness warrant later found to be factually inaccurate, Al-Kidd argued that qualified immunity does not apply because the detention violated al-Kidd's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights. He further argues that absolute immunity does not protect those who would use the material witness warrant to investigate an individual, and that the attorney general should not be permitted to claim greater immunity than the FBI agents that carried out his instructions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOD said that the prosecutors have recommended that the convening authority pursue the charges as capital. 

<p>Last month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that Mohammed and four others <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">would be tried by a military commission</a> [JURIST report] after the Obama administration abandoned attempts to have the 9/11 suspects tried in civilian courts. Holder had wanted the accused be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report] but referred the cases to the DOD after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US. In March 2010, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">hold civilian trials</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and other suspected terrorists saying that the military commissions system is fatally flawed and cannot be reformed. Earlier that month, the ACLU released a full-page advertisement in the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">urging President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] to uphold his pledge to try 9/11 suspects in civilian criminal court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ECHR found violations of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/treaties/html/005.htm">Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> [text] due to the conditions of his detention, the speed and circumstances under which the charges were brought against him, and with the length of continued detention pending the investigation and trial. The ECHR found that he was held in an inhuman detention unit from August 2005 though October 2005 and that his forcible arrest to be brought as a witness with subsequent charges went beyond what were necessary. The ECHR noted that there was evidence suggesting political motivation but that Khodorkovsky did not show incontrovertible proof: <blockquote>The Court admits that the applicant's case may raise a certain suspicion as to the real intent of the authorities, and that this state of suspicion might be sufficient for the domestic courts to refuse extradition, deny legal assistance, issue injunctions against the Russian Government, make pecuniary awards, etc. However, it is not sufficient for this Court to conclude that the whole legal machinery of the respondent State in the present case was <em>ab intio</em> misused, that from the beginning to the end the authorities were acting with bad faith and in blatant disregard of the Convention. This is a very serious claim which requires an incontrovertible and direct proof. Such proof... is absent from the case under examination.</blockquote>The ECHR complaint originated in February 2004 claiming violations of the Convention about his arrest. Russia is a signatory of the Convention. The ECHR awarded Khodorkovsky &#8364; 10,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, and &#8364; 14,543 for costs and expenses, which will be up to the Russian courts to enforce. 

<p>Last week, a Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/russia-appeals-court-upholds-khodorkovsky-conviction-reduces-sentence.php">upheld the second fraud convictions</a> [JURIST report] against Khodorkovsky and his business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Platon+Lebedev">news archive</a>] but reduced their eight-year sentences to seven years. The two men, already serving a sentence handed down in 2005 for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a>, were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December of embezzling from their company, Yukos Oil, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to an additional eight years. They <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/khodorkovsky-files-appeal-seeks-probe-against-judge.php">appealed</a>, alleging, among other things, that Judge Viktor Danilkin did <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/khodorkovsky-verdict-product-of-coercion-judges-assistant.php">not write the verdict</a> [JURIST reports] and that he was coerced into reading it. Khodorkovsky vehemently <a href="http://khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/appeal-denied-khodorkovsky-slams-courts-destruction-law-treason-against-peopl">criticized</a> [press release] the ruling as flying in the face of the rule of law. The two men can now expect to be released in 2016 instead of 2017. The December verdict drew harsh <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution." The <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main">Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Russian] dismissed critics, <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/ECD8813967CD249EC32578070037C1D6">saying</a> [press release, in Russian] that "[a]ttempts to exert pressure on the court are unacceptable."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rustam Makhmudov was <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/05/31/russia.journalist.killed.arrest/">arrested</a> [CNN report] at his parents' home in Chechnya almost five years after the killing as two of his brothers and a former police officer await trial for the murder in Moscow. A district court <a href="=/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya&page=2">acquitted</a> those three men in February 2009 due to a lack of prosecutorial evidence, but the Russian Supreme Court vacated the acquittal and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-court-orders-retrial-for.php">ordered a reinvestigation of the case</a> [JURIST reports]. Makhmudov will also be taken to Moscow as part of the investigation. A human rights activist and fierce critic of the Kremlin, Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in an elevator of her apartment building in Moscow as she was returning home on an October afternoon. Politkovskaya investigated human rights abuses in Chechnya and high-level corruption across Russia, and her death raised concerns about the safety of journalists and other critics of the government. At the time she was working for the low-circulation independent newspaper <em>Novaya Gazeta</em> where she was writing reports on Chechnya. Her death was widely believed to be a contract killing.

<p>Since 1992, at least 32 journalists have been murdered in Russia&#8212;11 since 2005, according to the <a href="http://cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> [advocacy website]. Last month, during a <a href="http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/2239">speech</a> [text] at a legal forum in St. Petersburg, Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] expressed the need for Russia to improve its legal system and make a better <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/russia-president-medvedev-says-lack-of-commitment-to-rule-of-law-holding-country-back.php">commitment to the rule of law</a> [JURIST report]. In December 2008, Medvedev's first year in office, he proposed that Russian courts become more transparent in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/EN/Header/Case-Law/HUDOC/HUDOC+database/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], for which Russia is a source of more applications than any other country. Earlier, in June 2008, Medvedev said he was committed to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/russia-president-pledges-support-for.php">improving Russia's human rights record</a> and enforcing the rule of law, reiterating pledges he made at his <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/incoming-russia-president-stresses.php">May inauguration</a> [JURIST reports]. Medvedev, himself a lawyer by training, promised top legal officials he would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/russia-president-vows-reforms-to-rid.php">tackle corruption and intimidation in the Russian judicial system</a> [JURIST report], calling for reforms to better train and support judges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group is composed of ex-military officials and even a former defense minister. A notorious episode of El Salvador's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder], the "Jesuit Massacre" saw six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter shot dead by soldiers at the prestigious Central American University in San Salvador. At the time, CNN had reported that for years the extreme right of the US-backed conservative government had accused the Jesuits of <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/05/30/spain.el.salvador.soldiers/?hpt=T2">siding with the leftist guerrilla rebels</a> [CNN report] of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) during the war, and that uniformed troops searched the residences at the University two days before the shootings. Shortly before he was killed, one of the Jesuits spoke to CNN about the war, saying that they had become accused to the violence. Five of the slain priests were born in Spain. The case was filed using Spain's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=spain+and+%22universal+jurisdiction%22">universal jurisdiction</a> [JURIST news archive] law, which holds that some crimes are so grave that they can be tried anywhere. The court issued international warrants to Spanish police and Interpol, ordering that the accused appear before the Spanish courts within 10 days. Around 70,000 people were killed during El Salvador's civil war before a 1992 UN-brokered agreement brought peace to the country.

<p>In the past decade, the US has made significant strides in prosecuting those involved in the El Salvadoran civil war. In April, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-seeks-deportation-of-salvadoran-general-for-human-rights-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] General Eugenio Vides Casanova, former defense minister of El Salvador, for human rights crimes committed during the civil war while he served as the country's top military officer. The US was also <a href="http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/50168/2011/04/18/General-Vides-Casanova-podria-ser-deportado-de-EE-UU-acusado-de-tortura">seeking to deport</a> [<em>La Pagina</em> report, in Spanish] Vides, who retired in Florida after completing his six-year term as defense minister. In 2006, <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">$55 million verdict</a> [JURIST report] against Vides and his co-defendant Jose Guillermo Garcia for allowing torture and other human rights violations during the war. In 2005, a US federal court reached a verdict against Nicolas Carranza, top commander of El Salvador's security forces during the civil war, for <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/us-jury-finds-ex-salvadoran-colonel.php">$2 million in compensatory damages</a> [JURIST report]. The case was brought by five Salvadoran citizens who alleged torture or had family killed by Carranza's soldier during the war. In 2000, however, the US lost the  battle to seek justice for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/2-salvador-generals-cleared-by-us-jury-in-nuns-deaths.html?ref=joseguillermogarcia">murders of four American churchwomen</a> [NYT report] during the civil war when both Vides and Garcia were acquitted. The ruling was grounded in the doctrine that the generals, although responsible for their soldiers, may not have had complete effective power to reign in the abuses of their troops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to transfer two cases stemming from post-election violence to Kenyan courts. The ICC <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/pre_trial%20chamber%20ii%20confirms%20the%20admissibility%20of%20the%20two%20cases%20in%20the%20kenyan%20situation">announced</a> [press release] Monday that they were <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1078822.pdf">denying</a> [decision, PDF] Kenya's request for the cases to be transferred, prompting Kenya to file a <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1082237.pdf">reply</a> [text, PDF] Tuesday. Kenya initially <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/kenya-to-challenge-icc-summons.php">asked that the six defendants</a> [JURIST report], called the "Ocampo Six," be tried in Kenya, arguing the ICC should only intervene in situations where the nation is unwilling or unable to investigate and prosecute, citing article 19(b) of the <a href = "http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]. The <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-face-allegations-of-inciting-violence.php">Ocampo Six</a> are <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-appear-before-icc-to-deny-charges-of-ethnic-killings.php">facing trial</a> [JURIST reports] for allegedly inciting violence during and after the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Kenya+2007+election">December 2007 Kenyan elections</a> [JURIST news archive]. The ICC claimed jurisdiction due to doubts that Kenya was willing to fully investigate the matter. In response, the Kenyan government's reply requested that the ICC rule on two other motions they have filed: one requesting a <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1057187.pdf">leave for reply</a> [text, PDF] and the other a <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1062611.pdf">"cooperation" request</a> [text, PDF], asking for assistance with the investigation. The reply argues that the decision should not have been made without ruling on these other two issues:<blockquote>These are matters of the greatest concern to the Government of Kenya not just because of the significance of cooperation in <em>domestic</em> investigations and proceedings <em>other</em> than those involving the six Suspects. Whether the Prosecutor should, and will, cooperate with the Government of Kenya is critical to the issue of the admissibility of the two cases presently before the ICC that will be further considered on appeal and/or at some later stage if and when there is any further application by any party to return jurisdiction to Kenya. Only by being allowed to reply to the Prosecutor's grave, but un-evidenced, allegations can the Government of Kenya ensure there is a record before the court of what its <em>present</em> response to those allegations may be, something of great potential importance for the deliberations of the Appeals Chamber and/or the Pre-Trial or Trial Chamber(s) at a later stage.</blockquote>In his <a href = "http://www.communication.go.ke/media.asp?id=1307">press release</a> [text], Wako denounced the ICC reaching the decision without an oral argument and stated that an appeal is forthcoming. Kenya has five days to file.

<p>The Ocampo Six include several high-ranking members of Kenya's government, the head of operations at <a href = "http://www.kassfm.co.ke/">Kass FM</a> [official website] in Nairobi and the son of Kenya's first president, <a href = "http://www.africawithin.com/bios/jomo_kenyatta.htm">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [Africa Within backgrounder]. Three of the men are members of the <a href = "http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website], and the other three are members of the opposing Party for National Unity (PNU). The ODM suspects are charged with fomenting violence against PNU members following the 2007 elections because they believed the election of Kenyan <a href = "http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] to be rigged. In response, the PNU suspects are charged with the conspiring with the <a href = "http://www.saferaccess.org/documents/The%20Mungiki%20-%20Cult%20Street%20Gang%20or%20Political%20Force.pdf">Mungiki criminal organization</a> [Safer Access backgrounder, PDF] to attack members of the ODM party. The ICC <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">summoned the suspects</a> [JURIST report] after determining they would not be charged in Kenya for the alleged crimes. In April, Kenya <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requested that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the government is capable of prosecuting the six men domestically. Lawyers for the Ocampo Six called for the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-leaders-ask-for-evidence-from-icc-prosecutor.php">timely release of evidence</a> [JURIST report] against their clients that month as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The move is seen as an attempt by Assad to defuse the 10-week uprising to overthrow the government. The decree frees all political prisoners whose crimes were committed before May 31, 2011. The amnesty also includes all members of MB and other political movements. The decree seems to have <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303745304576357572473376728.html">overturned</a> [WSJ report] a law banning MB from the country in 1980. But opposition leaders have <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/06/20116153830904339.html">dismissed the move</a> [Aljazeera report] and exiled leaders are meeting in Anatalya, Turkey, to discuss the future of the country. The government has reportedly been trying to put down the uprising using military force that has raised concern from human rights groups. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Wednesday published a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2011/06/01/we-ve-never-seen-such-horror">report</a> [text] claiming that the government of Syria is responsible for systematic abuse of its people from the beginning of the uprising on March 18. The report says: "[t]he nature and scale of abuses, which [HRW] research indicates were not only systematic, but implemented as part of a state policy, strongly suggest these abuses qualify as crimes against humanity." HRW called on the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> to impose sanctions and, if necessary, hold Syria accountable in the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> [official websites].

<p>Last month, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/siege-of-syria-town-violates-international-law-hrw.php">urged Syria to lift the siege</a> [JURIST report] on the town of Daraa and accused Syrian authorities of violating international law in attempting to quell protesters. Movement in and out of Daraa came to a halt almost in April when the Syrian army surrounded the city, cutting electricity, phone lines and Internet services as well as supplies such as food and medicine. In late April, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], in an emergency special session, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">publicly condemned the violence used by Syrian authorities</a> [JURIST report] against peaceful protesters. Earlier that month, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for Syria to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also in April, Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended the country's 48-year-old state of emergency</a> [JURIST report], but protests have continued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The move may be a sign that the uprising in Bahrain is winding down. Despite the lifting of the emergency laws, Bahrain <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/06/01/bahrain.unrest/">filed charges</a> [CNN report] against four opposition leaders in the <a href="http://www.alwefaq.org/">Al Wefaq party</a> [official website]. Parliamentary elections are set for September to replace the Al Wefaq ministers who left in protest of the emergency laws imposed. A day before lifting the emergency laws, Bahrain <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] called on his country to have a <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/2011531151255348899.html">national dialogue for reform</a> [Aljazeera report] as the military pulled out of some areas of the capital Manama. But many protesters say that they will remain vigilant until their demands for democratic reform are met. 

<p>Last month, a Bahrain court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-upholds-2-death-sentencess-for-police-killings--dnp.php">unanimously upheld death sentences</a> [JURIST report] for two men convicted of killing police officers during anti-government protests in March. The court reduced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">death sentences</a> [JURIST report] of two others to life in prison. The four men were tried in a special court under the emergency laws, during the Shiite-led protests in Bahrain. The special court and other measures implemented under emergency law have been heavily criticized by various human rights groups. Nabeel Rajab, leader of the <a href="http://www.bahrainrights.org/en">Bahrain Center for Human Rights </a> [advocacy website] criticized the ruling, expressing his concern that the cases are politically motivated and an attempt for the government to stop protests. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has urged the government of Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsettlement.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] Tuesday approved a <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/ftc/googlebuzz/EPIC_Google_Buzz_Settlement.pdf">settlement agreement</a> [text, PDF] in a privacy lawsuit against <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/">Google</a> [corporate website] over its <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz">Buzz</a> [website] social networking application, awarding damages to privacy groups previously left out of the original proposed settlement. Judge James Ware approved the revised settlement awarding $500,000 to the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website] which had filed a <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/ftc/googlebuzz/GoogleBuzz_Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] about Google Buzz, prompting an FTC lawsuit. The <a href="http://www.buzzclassaction.com/docs/sa.pdf">proposed settlement</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/google-announces-settlement-in-buzz-privacy-class-action-lawsuit.php">report</a>] forced Google to place $8.5 million dollars into a common fund to distribute to organizations that provide education regarding Internet privacy. The class counsel submitted a list of organizations, but others were able to apply for inclusion under <em>cy pres</em>, meaning awarding them damages was within the interests of the settlement. The court modified the list adding EPIC, saying:<blockquote>the Court does not find good cause to exclude EPIC from the list of recipients of the <em>cy pres</em> funds.  EPIC has demonstrated that it is a well-established and respected organization within the field of internet privacy and that it has sufficiently outlined how the <em>cy pres</em> funding will be used to further the interests of the class.</blockquote>The court also modified the organization list under <em>cy pres</em>, adding the <a href="http://www.scu.edu/ethics/">Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University</a> [official website], also awarding it $500,000.  

<p>The lawsuit alleged that the Buzz application exposed private user data, including contact lists, to other Gmail users. Google stressed that the settlement did not mean that the company was admitting liability for the privacy breach and that the company has since resolved all privacy issues with the Buzz application. In March, the FTC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">settled a similar privacy lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Google over charges that the Internet giant breached consumer privacy rights and was misleading during the launch of Buzz. The FTC alleges that when Google launched Buzz through its web-based email, Gmail, users were automatically enrolled without their consent and were unable to decline or leave the social network and that the Buzz privacy controls were confusing. Google has recently faced a number of allegations of violating privacy laws, both in the US and abroad. In November, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] confirmed that it is <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/fcc-investigating-google-for-street-view-privacy-breach.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Google to determine if it violated communications laws when its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=street+view">Street View</a> [JURIST news archive] vehicles inadvertently collected private user data, including passwords and URLs, over WiFi networks. In October, the FTC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the company's data collection through Street View cars after Google assured the FTC that it did not use any of the collected data and announced that it was <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/creating-stronger-privacy-controls.html">committed to compliance with privacy laws</a> [text], instituting new training on privacy principles and appointing a new director of privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, Ahmadinejad fired minister of oil Masoud Mirkazemi in an effort to streamline his cabinets and took control of the ministry as a "caretaker." The parliament voted <a href = "http://en.trend.az/regions/iran/1884517.html">165-1 with 13 abstentions</a> [<em>Trend</em> report] to try Ahmadinejad in the judiciary, as appointing himself caretaker is an "obvious violation of the constitution." Ahmadinejad's next move will reportedly be an attempt to combine the ministry of oil and the ministry of energy, which has been denounced by a <a href = "http://rc.majlis.ir/fa/report/download/790076">parliament report</a> [text, PDF, in Persian]. Iran is the current rotating president of the <a href = "http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/">Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries</a> (OPEC) [official website], and some have speculated that Ahmadinejad's actions were an effort to <A href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFHAF14511020110531?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">lead the OPEC conference in June</a> [Reuters report]. He has agreed to send a different minister in his place.

<p>Parliament's vote came just two days after Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, <a href = "http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/30/world/la-fg-iran-khamenei-20110530">endorsed Ahmadinejad</a> [LAT report] and pleaded for he and the parliament to reconcile. Ahmadinejad, Khamenei and the parliament have been at odds for the past few months. It is <a href = "http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/05/iran-constitutional-watchdog-rejects-ahmadinejads-bid-as-caretaker-oil-minister.html">reported</a> [LAT report] that the current move to become "caretaker" of the ministry of oil is in retribution for Khamenei overruling Ahmadinejad's decision to fire his chief intelligence officer. Although the Guardian Council, a group of clerics and jurists appointed by Khamenei and the parliament, already ruled that Khamenei could not serve as caretaker and president. He ignored their ruling. The president is free to appoint caretakers for ministers, but the caretaker may only stay in office for three months without parliamentary approval.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The USSC is considering retroactively applying the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1789:">Fair Sentencing Act</a> [S 1789 materials] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-signs-bill-to-reduce-cocaine-sentencing-disparity.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama last year. Holder said that the Act "not only reduced the inappropriate 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses ... it also strengthens the hand of law enforcement and includes tough new criminal penalties to mitigate the risks posed by our nation's most serious, and most destructive, drug traffickers and violent offenders." But he argued that more is necessary to ensure equal treatment under the law making it necessary to apply the new sentences retroactively, to prisoners currently serving time for crack cocaine offenses. Holder said:<blockquote>President Obama and I, along with leaders across the Administration, understand how illegal drugs&#8212;including crack&#8212;ravage communities. Crack offenders&#8212;especially violent ones&#8212;should be punished. And the Justice Department will make every effort to prosecute them. However, as years of experience and study have shown, there is simply no just or logical reason why their punishments should be dramatically more severe than those of other cocaine offenders&#8212;a position that Congress overwhelmingly supported with the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act.</blockquote>The USSC is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/crime-scene/post/holder-reduce-sentences-for-crack-convicts/2011/06/01/AGlDfUGH_blog.html">considering reducing the sentences</a> [WP report] of some currently incarcerated on crack cocaine convictions by an average of three years. That could mean the release of one out of every 18 federal prisoners or about 12,000. 

<p>The Fair Sentencing Act amended existing law to reduce the current sentencing ratio from 100:1 to 18:1. Under the existing law passed in 1986, an individual possessing five grams of crack cocaine would receive a mandatory five-year prison sentence, while an individual possessing powder cocaine would need to have 100 times that amount to receive the same sentence. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/28/us-end-sight-infamous-crack-cocaine">praised</a> [press release] the bill's passage, stating that the old law also created a racial disparity, with African Americans comprising 79.8 percent of all offenders sentenced for crack cocaine violations. In April 2008, a study released by the USSC reported that more than 3,000 prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">had their sentences reduced</a> [JURIST report] under an amendment to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelin.htm">Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials]. In 2007, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-sentencing-panel-backs-retroactive.php">USSC voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to give retroactive effect to an earlier sentencing guideline amendment that reduced crack cocaine penalties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He is charged with crimes that shocked the conscience of the international community. These crimes symbolize the brutality of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</blockquote>

<p>At sentencing, Mubarak and his family could face the death penalty.

Egypt's public prosecutor has decided not to transfer Mubarak yet, and conceded he may not be well enough to stand trial in August. Earlier this week, Mubarak was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-court-fines-mubarak-90-million-for-internet-telecom-shutdown-during-protests.php">fined USD $90 million</a> [JURIST report] for cutting off the nation's Internet access in January.</p>

<p>Last week, Amnesty International reported that at least <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report], and more than 6,000 were injured, during the Egyptian protests. Earlier this month, an Egyptian criminal court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/egypt-court-convicts-former-tourism-minister-for-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] the country's former tourism minister, Zoheir Garranah, for corruption and sentenced him to five years in prison. In April, Egyptian prosecutors <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/former-egypt-officials-charged-with-corruption.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former prime minister Ahmed Nazif, former finance minister Yousef Boutros and former interior minister Habib el Adly with corruption. In March, a commission of Arab and Egyptian human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-rights-commission-accuses-mubarak-of-protester-murders.php">accused the former president</a> [JURIST report] and the country's police of murdering protesters during the demonstrations. The joint commission submitted their report to Egypt's top prosecutor for further investigation. The Supreme Military Council of Egypt, which assumed power after Mubarak's resignation, instructed Egypt's top prosecutor to <a href = "http://en.rian.ru/world/20110323/163161631.html">investigate the death of protesters</a> [RIA Novosti report] during the three weeks of demonstrations in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission's 92-page report said Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances, and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." The commission also says that there is consistent evidence of war crimes being committed in violation of the Rome Statute and that "consistent pattern of violations identified creates an inference that they were carried out as a result of policy decisions by [Gaddafi] and members of his inner circle." The report said estimates show 10,000&#8211;15,000 have been killed since <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/libya-government-promises-constitutional-reforms-following-protests.php">protests began in February</a> [JURIST report]. The commission also determined that the Libyan authorities were making "blanket" arrests, targeting those suspected of being opposition supporters rather than in connection with alleged criminal acts. The report said: <blockquote>There is sufficient evidence to suggest that Government forces used excessive force against demonstrators, at least in the early days of the protests, leading to significant deaths and injuries. Such actions represented a serious breach of a range of rights under international human rights law, including the right to life, the right to security of person, the right to freedom of assembly and the right to freedom of expression.</blockquote>The commission made specific recommendations for the government of Libya, including urging it to stop the violence against civilians in violation of applicable humanitarian and human rights law, to investigate alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and to release all the prisoners who are being held for peaceful participation in the protests or for arbitrary reasons.

<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official websites] announced he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">seeking arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi and two others in his "inner circle" on charges of crimes against humanity. Ocampo has since sent a letter to Libyan Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi, warning against diplomats covering up crimes for Gaddafi. Further, Ocampo alleged that cover-ups in Libya go so far that any trace of a crime is destroyed. Ocampo revealed in April that his office had <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icc-prosecutor-claims-to-have-evidence-gaddafi-planned-attacks-on-civilians.php">uncovered evidence</a> [JURIST report] that Gaddafi planned to attack civilians to forestall regime-toppling revolution. Ocampo indicated that the plans were made in response to the conflicts in Tunisia and Egypt and included shooting civilians. In March, Ocampo told the press that he was 100 percent certain his office would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-certain-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-charges.php">bring charges</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi. Also in March, the ICC launched a probe into <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">allegations of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] by the Libyan government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>gacaca</em> courts were established by the Rwandan government in 2001 to reduce the caseload in the country's traditional justice system.  The accused are taken to the villages where they allegedly committed their crimes, and the trials are carried on in a more informal manner with a goal of providing swift trials with community participation. The report cites many instances of fair trial violations, including defense witness intimidation, bribery, untrained judges, embellishment of charges and various restrictions that prevent an accused from effectively defending himself. HRW also faults the Rwandan government for preventing soldiers from the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-03.htm">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> (RPF) [HRW backgrounder], the country's current ruling party, from standing trial and for transferring rape cases to <em>gacaca</em> courts, which opened up the cases to the entire community and stripped victims of privacy that they would have enjoyed in the conventional court system. HRW argues that instances of fair trial violations and other miscarriages of justice should be reviewed by professional judges in the conventional court system, rather than in the <em>gacaca</em> courts:<blockquote>If <em>gacaca</em> courts review alleged miscarriages of justice, there is a risk of repeating some of the same problems. Instead, the government should ensure the formal justice system reviews these cases in a professional, fair, and impartial way. This would help secure <em>gacaca</em>'s legacy and strengthen Rwanda's justice system for generations to come.</blockquote>
Rwanda has more than 12,000 <em>gacaca</em> courts that have tried 1.2 million cases since 2005. The Rwandan government originally scheduled the <em>gacaca</em> courts to finish hearing trials in mid-2010, but that was postponed. The courts are officially set to close by December 2011.

<p>Higher-level cases related to the 1994 genocide have been tried in the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website], a creation of the UN Security Council. Last month, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-convicts-ex-military-chief-bizimungu-3-others.php">convicted former Rwandan army chief</a> [JURIST report] Augustin Bizimungu and three others for their involvement in the 1994 genocide. Bizimungu was found guilty of six counts of genocide and crimes against humanity for murder, extermination and rape in addition to violations of Common Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/">Geneva Conventions</a> [text]. Bizimungu <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2002/08/15/rwanda-top-genocidaire-arrest-important-step">ordered soldiers and policemen to exterminate</a> [HRW report] tens of thousands of Tutsi civilians who had taken refuge in churches, hospitals and schools during the genocide. In March, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-sentences-former-mayor-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Jean-Baptiste Gatete, the former mayor of the Murambi Commune in Byumna prefecture, to life imprisonment after he was convicted on charges of genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity of extermination, murder, and rape. Gatete was found to have murdered and carried out orders to rape and murder thousand of Tutsi citizens. An estimated total of 800,000 people were killed during the genocide that took place in the span of 100 days.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint was filed in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] on behalf of the <a href="http://www.afscmefl.org/">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 79</a> (AFSCME) [official website], a union representing 50,000 public workers affected by the order. In the complaint, the ACLUFL argues that the order violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable governmental searches and case law stating that drug-testing without suspicion is unreasonable except under certain circumstances, such as when employees are involved in "safety-sensitive" positions. The ACLUFL points out that the governor's reasoning behind the order was not to promote safety, but to exert control over employees in order to maintain discipline and lessen absenteeism. The ACLUFL further argues that the order would not only violate employees' constitutional rights, but would also cause the AFSCME to waste personnel and monetary resources since the drug testing policy would be subject to collective bargaining. Special counsel for the AFSCME argued that the order unfairly singles out public workers:<blockquote>Government employees go to work, do their jobs, pay their bills and contribute to their communities just like anyone else.  There is no suggestion that government workers use drugs more than the public at large so to single them out for government searches is unnecessary, expensive and offensive.</blockquote>The complaint asks the court to quash the order as violative of the Fourth Amendment and direct all agencies to cease drug testing that was implemented as a result of the order. The complaint also requests that the court enjoin all agencies affected by the order from implementing the drug-testing policy until final judgment is entered.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] handed down a decision in January regarding background checks into federal contract employees' possible past drug use and their impact on Fifth Amendment rights. In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-530">NASA v. Nelson</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-nasa-background-checks-evidence.php">report</a>], the court upheld that NASA's background investigation into whether a federal contract employee has received counseling or treatment for illegal drug use did not violate the employee's constitutional right to informational privacy under the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit held that the background checks did violate this right, but the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-rules-nasa-background-checks-are-constitutional.php">Supreme Court reversed</a> [JURIST report], stating that the government has an interest in conducting basic employment background checks to ensure "the security of its facilities and in employing a competent, reliable work-force."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The case was the first in which a civilian was charged and convicted by the military since a 2006 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN02766:">amendment</a> [S 2766 materials] to the <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) [text] granted the military jurisdiction over civilians accompanying US troops in a combat zone, and the first time a civilian was charged and convicted under military law since the Vietnam war. Ali's lawyer, Army Capt. Tiffany Dewell, argued that the 2006 amendment opened the door for non-military individuals accompanying US forces in combat to be tried by court-martial. Dewell also suggested that upholding Ali's conviction would be a slippery slope leading to more trials by court-martial, the use of which the Supreme Court has narrowed in a series of rulings. Civilians have fewer protections when tried by court martial.

<p>The US military <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/us-civilian-contractor-charged-under.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] Ali in the stabbing death of another contractor in February 2008. Prior to the 2006 UCMJ amendment, contractors working in Iraq were exempt from prosecution in that country. The amendment, found in Section 522 of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:SN02766:">2007 defense authorization bill</a> [2 2766 materials; LawReader <a href="http://news.lawreader.com/?p=1208">backgrounder</a>], significantly changed the military's jurisdiction to bring civilian contractors within the military's jurisdiction during a "contingency operation" rather than its previous requirement that Congress actually declare war. In 2007, Congress took <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/congress-considers-putting-armed.php">further steps</a> [JURIST report] to bring US contractors within the jurisdiction of the military with the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.01585:">2008 defense authorization bill</a> [HR 1585 materials]. Victor Hansen indicated that Ali's seemingly unremarkable case could have a <a href="/forumy/2008/04/military-jurisdiction-over-civilians.php">significant impact on military law</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?682648548">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website] is representing plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate which requires that all citizens purchase health insurance. The court divided the arguments into two parts, first addressing <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/documents/10_2388_argumentsmotion.mp3">standing</a> and then on the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/documents/10_2388_argumentsmerits.mp3">merits</a> [oral arguments, audio]. One of the plaintiffs, Jann DeMars had complained that the individual mandate would be a financial burden on her, but she subsequently purchased health insurance through her employer when she received a new job. The government argued that the case should be dismissed for lack of standing since there is currently no injury in fact because the requirement to purchase insurance has not even taken effect. The plaintiffs argued though that there is a clear statutory burden being imposed as the plaintiffs are forced to rearrange their financial affairs in preparation for having to buy health insurance. On the merits, the court asked the parties to address whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [text] applies, which prevents injunctions to tax burdens until they are enforced. Counsel representing the plaintiffs argued that the Act did not apply because the burden was a "penalty" and not a tax. The plaintiffs further argued that the individual mandate exceeded the federal government's power under the Commerce Clause because the mandate regulates "inactivity" by requiring individuals to purchase insurance. Counsel argued that it would likely be permissible for the government to provide tax incentives to encourage people to purchase health insurance, but forcing them to purchase by threat of a penalty is unconstitutional. The government argued that since DeMarrs now has insurance the case is moot. The government also argued that citizens will at some point not "choose" to participate in the health care market, citing the high costs that go unpaid because for care of the uninsured which gets passed on to insurance companies. 

<p>Before oral arguments the judges asked the parties to file briefs on <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/sixth-circuit-asks-health-care-challengers-to-explain-why-they-can-sue.php">whether the parties had standing</a> [JURIST report] to bring a challenge before the effective date of the law. The individual mandate in the <a href="/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [HR 3590 materials], passed as part of the health care law, has been controversial spurring multiple lawsuits challenging its constitutionality. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] sought to have its challenge reinstated in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] after it was dismissed by the lower court. Last February, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked federal judge Roger Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">clarify that states must continue to enact the health care reform law</a> as the government appeals from Vinson's January ruling <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">finding the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Port Authority seeks to overturn the <a href = "http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2008/2008_03991.htm">2008 decision</a> [text] that upheld a <a href = "/paperchase/2005/10/ny-port-authority-found-negligent-in.php">2005 jury verdict</a> [JURIST report] apportioning 68 percent of the fault to the Port Authority and 32 percent to the terrorists who committed the attack. The <a href = "Appellate Division, First Department">Appellate Division (First Judicial Department)</a> [official website] disallowed the Port Authority from arguing qualified immunity. In this appeal, the Port Authority's argued:<blockquote>[I]n denying it immunity, 'the courts below disregarded the clear mandates of this Court shielding discretionary governmental decisions from liability and have allowed, even encouraged, the use of tort law to second-guess these considered policy choices.' Contending it did not breach its proprietary duty, it says, 'Earlier premises liability cases established that private landlords must take only 'minimal measures' to prevent foreseeable criminal intrusions. The Port Authority's counterterrorism measures easily surpassed that standard.' Regarding its share of liability, it says, "Holding the Port Authority more than twice as culpable as the actual terrorists is per se unreasonable and undermines confidence in our system of justice.'</blockquote>Most claims that were filed against the Port Authority for the attacks were settled out of court and thus unaffected by this appeal. Six suits remain in flux: five for personal injury and one for business interruption. The court is expected to rule in a month.

<p>The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center by Islamic radicals killed six and injured 1,000 through a car bomb placed in the basement parking garage of the WTC. Five men were captured and sentenced to life in prison for the attack. After the bombing, 648 plaintiffs filed 174 negligence actions against the Port Authority for "alleged breach of its proprietary duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition." Negligence was assessed against the Port Authority after documents revealed that the WTC garage had been ignoring safety fears since 1984. The Port Authority police superintendent, at the time, stated the parking areas "[we]re accessible to the public and are highly susceptible to car bombings." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint seeks to compel a number of federal agencies to comply with the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials] by investigating the environmental impact of fracking and making the findings available to the public prior to adopting a proposal by the <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/">Delaware River Basin Commission</a> (DRBC) [advocacy website] authorizing natural gas development in the Delaware River Basin. Pursuant to NEPA, the environmental impact statement (EIS) must include analysis of the environmental impacts of the proposed action, consideration of alternatives to the action and measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/about.html">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> [official profile] expressed concern about the safety of fracking in a <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2011/may/may31a_11.html">statement</a> [press release] Wednesday:<blockquote>Before any decisions on drilling are made, it is our responsibility to follow the facts and understand the public health and safety effects posed by potential natural gas development. The federal government has an obligation to undertake the necessary studies, and as I made clear last month, this office will compel it to do so. The welfare of those living near the Delaware River Basin, as well as the millions of New Yorkers who rely on its pure drinking water each day, will not be ignored.</blockquote> The complaint further alleges that authorization of the fracking plan would undermine an agreement between New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey promising that "no project having a substantial effect on the water resources of the basin shall hereafter be undertaken by any person, corporation or governmental authority unless it shall have been first submitted to and approved by the commission."

<p>Fracking, has become a controversial issue as it is implemented in the US and around the world. France's lower house, the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/index.asp">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French], approved a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/ta/ta0658.asp">bill</a> [TA Bill No. 658, <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/interdiction_exploration_exploitation_hydrocarbures_non_conventionnels.asp">materials</a>, in French; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/france-lower-house-approves-ban-on-shale-gas-tapping.php">report</a>] in May to prohibit the drilling of gas and oil through hydraulic fracturing and to repeal hydraulic fracturing licenses granted to companies. Fracking is a process by which water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the ground to create fractures in rocks which releases trapped gas and oil to the surface. Environmental and health concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing include contamination of ground water, migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface and the potential mishandling of waste.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Demonstrators are reported to be peacefully protesting, or simply organizing protests, when interrogated and detained. The report details several incidents of protester abuse.<blockquote>Several activists in the capital told Human Rights Watch that they believed that the increased security at Baghdad's Tahrir Square and the recent arrests were an attempt to head off reinvigoration of public protests, amid efforts by various small protest groups to work together. They said that neighborhood officials had warned them that security forces had made increased inquiries into the activists' whereabouts and activities over the past two weeks.</blockquote><a href = "http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a similar <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/iraqi-authorities-must-stop-clampdown-peaceful-protest-2011-06-01">report</a> [text] earlier this week, decrying many of the same incidents. AI calls for Iraqi authorities to end their assault on peaceful protests, and HRW asks that the government investigates the attacks and charge or release those demonstrators being held.

<p>Numerous human rights groups have accused Iraq of detainee torture and other human rights violations. AI alleged in February that the Iraqi government is <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/iraq-government-torturing-detainees-in-secret-prisons-amnesty.php">operating secret prisons</a> [JURIST report], and suspects held in Iraqi custody have been systematically tortured since before the 2003 US invasion. In September, AI published a different report alleging that the Iraqi government is <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/thousands-iraqi-detainees-risk-torture-after-us-handover-2010-09-13">unlawfully detaining and torturing</a> [JURIST report] thousands of detainees. In June, UN Special Representative to Iraq Ad Melkert <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/un-advises-iraq-to-ratify-convention-against-torture.php">urged the Iraqi government</a> [JURIST report] to ratify the UN <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text]. Melkert stated that Iraq had made several advances in recognizing human rights violations, but the government's policy implementation still faces several obstacles. The convention was adopted by the UN in 1984 and has been ratified by 147 countries. Iraq remains one of 45 member-countries that have yet to ratify the treaty. In April 2010, HRW <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">reported on the repeated torture</a> [JURIST report] of Iraqi detainees in a secret prison in Baghdad. HRW reported that detainees held at the secret Muthanna facility, run by Iraqi authorities, were hung upside-down, deprived of air, kicked, whipped, beaten, given electric shocks and sodomized during torture sessions that detainees faced every three to four days. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Donald Berwick, administrator of the <a href="http://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services</a> sent a <a href="http://www.wibc.com/other/pdf/IN_SPA_disapproval_letter_6_1_11_FINAL.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Patricia Casanova of the Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/fssa/ompp/3446.htm">Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning</a> [official websites] in response to a request for approval, saying the law violates federal law. Medicaid funds cannot be used for abortions under federal law, except in cases of rape or incest, and funds can only be used for health services from a "qualified provider." The Indiana law disqualifies places that provide abortion services. States have the ability to assign the qualified provider status, but the letter says the law violates <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1902.htm">&#167; 1902(a)(23) of the Social Security Act</a> [text] because it prevents Medicaid beneficiaries from receiving services from certain providers for reasons unrelated to the providers qualifications to provide those services. The letter stated: <blockquote>Medicaid programs may not exclude qualified health care providers from providing services that are funded under the program because of a provider's scope of practice. Such a restriction would have a particular effect on beneficiaries' ability to access family planning providers, who are subject to additional protections under [the Social Security Act].</blockquote>Betty Cockrum of <a href="http://www.ppin.org/index.html">Planned Parenthood of Indiana</a> (PPIN) [official website] praised the determination by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, saying the message was clear, "you cannot prevent Medicaid patients from choosing their family planning providers. I trust the State of Indiana will do the right thing, not only for PPIN patients, but for all Medicaid patients in the state and reverse its course."

<p>Last month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-indiana-planned-parenthood-cuts.php">refused to block</a> [JURIST report] the Indiana law signed by <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/2635.htm">Governor Mitch Daniels</a> [official profile] earlier that week. Several other states have acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. Last month, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/index.htm">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota law requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota <a href="http://markdayton.org/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks.  Also in May, Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] signed into law a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to first get a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">sonogram</a> [JURIST report].  Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Makhmudov, an assumed assassin on an <a href = "http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c32/155221.html">international most wanted list since 1997</a> [ITAR-TASS report], was charged with violating <a href = "http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionVII/Chapter16.html">Article 105</a>, murder; <a href = "http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionVII/Chapter17.html">Article 126</a>, abduction; <a href = "http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionVIII/Chapter22.html">Article 178</a>, extortion; and <a href = "http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionIX/Chapter24.html">Article 222</a>, illegal acquisition of firearms, of the <A href = "http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/">Russian Criminal Code</a> [text]. If convicted, he is expected to receive life imprisonment, the highest sentence possible under those articles of the criminal code. The Federal Security Services is proceeding on the belief that Makhmudov was hired to kill Politkovskaya and did not act alone. 

<p>A human rights activist and critic of the Kremlin, Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in an elevator of her apartment building in Moscow as she was returning home. Politkovskaya investigated human rights abuses in Chechnya and high-level corruption across Russia, and her death raised concerns about the safety of journalists and other critics of the government. At the time she was working for the low-circulation independent newspaper <a href = "http://www.newtimes.ru/"><em>Novaya Gazeta</em></a> [official website, in Russian] where she was writing reports on Chechnya. Her death was widely believed to be a contract killing. Two of Makhmudov's brothers and a former police officer are currently awaiting trial for the murder in Moscow. A district court <a href="=/jurist_search.php?q=politkovskaya&amp;page=2">acquitted</a> those three men in February 2009 due to a lack of prosecutorial evidence, but the Russian Supreme Court vacated the acquittal and <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/russia-court-orders-retrial-for.php">ordered a reinvestigation of the case</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Google <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/01/google-hacking-chinese-attack-gmail">disclosed</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] on Wednesday that hundreds of users, including US government and military officials and political activists, were targets of a "phishing" scam originating in Jinan, the capital of Shandong province. Google alleges that the hacking scheme may have been authorized by the Chinese government. <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/161848.htm">Christopher Painter</a> [official website], coordinator for cyber issues for the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website], indicated that determining whether the act was state-sponsored is a <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/US-investigating-Google-claim-of-China-hacking-1406348.php">challenge in cybersecurity</a> [AP report]. Delegates from various governments and private sector corporations convened for a conference in London to discuss such cybersecurity issues. China has since rejected Google's hacking claims, arguing the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/02/china-google-idUSB9E7EP03320110602">claims are unfounded</a> [Reuters report].

<p>China has been involved in a number of cybersecurity issues recently. In December, the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/world/asia/05wikileaks-china.html?partner=rss&emc=rss">reported</a> [text] that Chinese officials allegedly <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/leaked-cables-reveal-china-officials-oversaw-google-hack.php">orchestrated the hacking</a> [JURIST report] of Google, which caused the Internet company to briefly pull out of China earlier in 2010. In November, Google urged the international community to <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.google.com/googleblogs/pdfs/trade_free_flow_of_information.pdf&pli=1&chrome=true">ensure the free flow of online information</a> [white paper text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/google-calls-for-global-trade-rules-to-limit-internet-restrictions.php">report</a>] by establishing new rules to protect against limitations on the Internet. In September, the <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/">State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China</a> [official website, in Chinese] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-government-cites-human-rights-improvements.php">released a position paper</a> [JURIST report] claiming that it has heightened Internet freedoms and describing how the Internet has become a tool for the Chinese government to promote transparency and consult the public before developing certain policies. In July, a Chinese government official said that <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/google-agreed-to-follow-chinese-censorship-laws-official.php">Google had agreed to follow Chinese censorship laws</a> [JURIST report] to gain a license renewal that would still prevent users from accessing sites that threatened national security, while not requiring Google to censor its China or Hong Kong based websites. This <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/google-to-stop-redirecting-china-users-to-unfiltered-hong-kong-search-engine.php">agreement was reached</a> [JURIST report] in June after a dispute concerning Google's practice of redirecting mainland users to the Hong Kong-based website as a means of working around censorship laws. China responded by <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-says-international-internet.php">reiterating its commitment to open Internet</a> [JURIST report], but stressing that international Internet companies must follow Chinese law. In February, the government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-government-announces-new.php">announced new regulations</a> [JURIST report] further restricting Internet use by requiring Chinese citizens to submit identity cards and meet with regulars before registering a website, prompting many to register sites overseas to avoid regulation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The challenge was brought by the <a href="http://www.bhof.org/index.html">Bronx Household of Faith</a> [church website], which was denied use of school facilities after applying through the city's procedures. New York schools allow the facilities to be used for "social, civic and recreational meetings and entertainments, and other uses pertaining to the welfare of the community," as long as it is "nonexclusive and ... open to the general public," under <a href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/education/EDN0414_414.html">NY Education Code &#167; 414(1)(c)</a> [text]. The city issued a new <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F3A5562-563C-4870-871F-BB9156EEE60B/0/03062009SOPM.pdf">Standard Operating Procedures Manual</a> (SOP) [text, PDF] pursuant to that provision, specifically &#167; 511, that restricts use of school facilities for religious worship services. The Bronx Household of Faith wanted to use the school for worship services which included preaching, teaching, and giving of personal testimonials, followed by a group meal. The court found the rule did not violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] protection for freedom of expression because it was a reasonable conduct restriction. The court said that even though religious worship includes expression, the city was reasonably concerned with violating the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] because "[t]he conduct of a 'religious worship service' has the effect of placing centrally, and perhaps even of establishing, the religion in the school." The court concluded:<blockquote>that the challenged rule does not constitute viewpoint discrimination because it does not seek to exclude expressions of religious points of view or of religious devotion, but rather excludes for valid non-discriminatory reasons only a type of activity&#8212;the conduct of worship services. We also conclude that because Defendants reasonably seek by the rule to avoid violating the Establishment Clause, the exclusion of religious worship services is a reasonable content-based restriction, which does not violate the Free Speech Clause.</blockquote>Judge John Walker dissented, arguing that the SOP rule was neither a valid view-point restriction nor supported by a reasonable concern of violating the Establishment Clause. 

<p>In April, Utah <a href="http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/my_mission.html">Attorney General Mark Shurtleff</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/utah-ag-asks-supreme-court-to-rule-on-memorial-crosses.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to decide whether crosses placed beside highways as memorials to deceased <a href="http://publicsafety.utah.gov/highwaypatrol/index.html">Utah Highway Patrol</a> (UHP) [official website] troopers is an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. The petition seeks review of an August <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/tenth-circuit-finds-memorial-crosses-along-highways-unconstitutional.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/clerk/opinions.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website], which found that "the cross memorials would convey to a reasonable observer that the state of Utah is endorsing Christianity." Also last month, the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-national-day-of-prayer.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional challenge to the <a href="http://nationaldayofprayer.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> (NDP) [official website], overturning an earlier <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/doj-to-appeal-ruling-finding-national.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST report] that found the event in violation of the Establishment Clause by representing government-backed encouragement that Americans engage in non-secular activity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontmarijuana.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a> [official website] released a <A href = "http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/Download.ashx?File=Global_Commission_Report_English.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] Thursday recommending international legalization of cannabis, marijuana and other drugs. The panel also recommended expanding the variety of treatments available to drug users, as well as making them more available, and investing in programs to discourage children from using drugs, rather than enforcing harsh punishments against drug users. The report also encourages each country to develop unique, human rights-based approaches to drug regulation and violations of drug law.<blockquote>The idea that the international drug control system is immutable, and that any amendment&#8212;however reasonable or slight&#8212;is a threat to the integrity of the entire system, is short-sighted. As with all multilateral agreements, the drug conventions need to be subject to constant review and modernization in light of changing and variable circumstances. Specifically, national governments must be enabled to exercise the freedom to experiment with responses more suited to their circumstances. This analysis and exchange of experiences is a crucial element of the process of learning about the relative effectiveness of different approaches, but the belief that we all need to have exactly the same laws, restrictions and programs has been an unhelpful restriction.</blockquote>Most controversially, the report insisted that the <a href = "http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf">UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961</a> [text, PDF] and the US's "War on Drugs" campaign had failed. Both policies recommend limiting possession and use of drugs for non-medicinal or scientific purposes, and addressing drug trafficking through minimum sentencing for any level of drug dealer. The US <a href = "http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov">Office of National Drug Policy</a> (ONDCP) [official website] released a statement in response, <a href = "http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press11/060211.html">denouncing the report</a> [text]: "Legalization remains a non-starter in the Obama Administration because research shows that illegal drug use is associated with voluntary treatment admissions, fatal drugged driving accidents, mental illness, and emergency room admissions."

<p>Members of the panel include: former UN <a href = "http://www.un.org/sg/annan.shtml">Secretary-General Kofi Annan</a> [official profile], Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, Greek <a href = "http://www.papandreou.gr">Prime Minister George Papandreou</a> [official website], <a href = "http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson">Richard Branson</a> [official profile] and former US Secretary of State George Shultz. Although the report was critical of the US, drug policy has shifted from past stricter policies in recent years. Earlier this week, <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] recommended the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/holder-calls-for-retroactive-application-of-crack-sentencing-law.php">retroactive application of a new law</a> [JURIST report] bringing the sentences for crack cocaine more in line for those of powder cocaine. This could reduce the sentences of some currently incarcerated on crack cocaine convictions by an average of three years. Arizona <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-medical-marijuana-law.php">legalized medical marijuana</a> [JURIST report] in November 2010, but <a href = "http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-file-lawsuit-over-controversial-state-medical-marijuana-law.php">federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a declaratory judgment over the legality of the law under federal guidelines. Medical marijuana is currently legal in 14 US states. In October 2009, Holder issued <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">guidelines for a new policy</a> [JURIST report] for investigating and prosecuting state-sanctioned medical marijuana use. Those guidelines reflect a pledge made by Holder in March to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/doj-to-end-raids-on-medical-marijuana.php">stop federal raids</a> [JURIST report] on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state laws. However, Holder has emphasized that if a state legalizes drugs for recreational use, <a href = "http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/16/local/la-me-marijuana-holder-20101016">federal law will be enforced</a> [<em>LAT</em> report], as California <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/western-voter-reject-propositions-to-expand-access-to-legalized-marijuana.php">attempted to legalize marijuana last year</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22us+supreme+court%22">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-1233.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] last week in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1233">Brown v. Plata</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">report</a>] to uphold an order requiring California to release up to 46,000 prisoners to remedy the state's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=California+prison">overcrowded prisons</a> [JURIST news archive]. Brown said it would take <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2011/06/jerry-brown-more-time-to-implement-supreme-court-prison-ruling.html">more than two years to submit a plan</a> [LAT report] to a three-judge panel, far longer than the two-week timeline offered by the high court. Brown plans to shift prisoners to county jails in an attempt to decrease state prison populations. His plans will be undermined if voters, who were recently polled as against spending more tax money on prisons, reject his recent <a href = "http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2011/06/voter-support-for-browns-taxes-still-sags-below-50.html">tax proposal</a> [LAT report].

<p>Overcrowding has been a significant problem for California prisons for many years. In August 2009, a special panel of federal judges <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2009/08/04/Opinion%20&%20Order%20FINAL.pdf">ordered</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-judges-order-california-to.php">report</a>] California to reduce its prison population by approximately 46,000 inmates or construct more facilities to handle the prisoners. It is apparent that California is unable to build the prisons and will have to release the prisoners. California has also considered plans to release some inmates early, in light of its budget crisis. In July 2009, state lawmakers passed a budget with $1.2 billion in cuts to the prison system, but <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jw7i79XZonvRtzXqgwaP726Vcf1Q">no specific plan was formulated</a> [AFP report]. The same panel of judges issued a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/media/acrobat/2009-02/44975285.pdf">tentative ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/federal-judges-order-california-to.php">report</a>] in February, reaching the same conclusion. At that time, Brown, acting as Attorney General, opposed the decision, <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/newsalerts/release.php?id=1678">commenting</a> [press release], "[t]he court's tentative ruling is not constitutionally justified. Therefore, the state will appeal directly to the US Supreme Court when the final order is issued." In August 2008, California's court-appointed prison medical overseer <a href="http://www.mcgeorge.edu/x7308.xml">J. Clark Kelso</a> [official profile] asked the court to <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-prison-receiver-asks-court.php">force the state to pay $8 billion</a> [JURIST report] over the next five years to improve prison hospitals and bring inmate health care up to constitutional standards. Two months earlier, a California court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/california-court-upholds-inmate.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state constitution permitted easing overcrowding by transferring prisoners to out-of-state facilities. The transfers had been ordered in an <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/proclamation/4278/">emergency proclamation</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/california-governor-proclaims.php">report</a>] issued by then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaclu.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [official websites] and a coalition of other civil rights groups <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/gacomplaint_20110602.pdf">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Thursday challenging a Georgia <a href="http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb87.htm">immigration law</a> [HB 87 text] similar to Arizona law already being challenged in federal court. The groups filed the lawsuit in the <a href="http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> [official website] to block the law they characterized as a "show-me-your-papers" scheme since it will force citizens to prove their identity using specific documents. Omar Jadwat, staff attorney for the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, said the Georgia law is unconstitutional because it violates the Fourth Amendment by allowing law enforcement to detain individuals without necessary papers, and it violates the Supremacy Clause because only the federal government can make such immigration regulations. The plaintiffs include Paul Edwards who, as part of a local Christian faith group, transports undocumented individuals to places of worship and places for medical services. They argue that under HB 87, Edwards would be subject to criminal liability for transporting, assisting, or harboring undocumented individuals. Linton Joaquin, general counsel for NILC, pointed out that under HB 87, law enforcement would not accept the drivers licenses of states that do not have immigration restrictions such as Washington and New Mexico. He suggested that drivers with one of these licenses could be detained for failure to prove citizenship. He said the law "creates a police state repugnant to our fundamental values." Karen Tumlin, managing attorney with NILC, said the law:<blockquote>gives Georgians a reason to fear that they may be stripped of their constitutional rights simply because of the way they look or sound.  Laws that promote this kind of bare-bones discrimination are out of step with history and cannot be allowed to stand. We are confident that the Court will agree that unconstitutional attempts to drive a wedge between Georgian communities should not be allowed.</blockquote> The groups filing the lawsuit called on the federal government and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to be consistent by taking a stand against this immigration law as it has done with the Arizona law. The groups are hopeful to win a preliminary injunction to stop the law from ever taking effect, which it is set to do on July 1. 

<p>Last month, the Georgia bill was signed into law by <a href="http://gov.georgia.gov/02/governor/home/0,2822,165937316,00.html">Governor Nathan Deal</a> [official website]. HB 87 allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. The law also imposes fines and prison sentences of up to one year for anyone who knowingly transports illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the immigration status of potential employees, providing that workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment could face up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Also last month, the ACLU filed two similar lawsuits to block immigration laws in both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports]. A decision by US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href = "/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] last month on preemption of an state immigration laws may have an impact on such lawsuits. The court held in <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/rights-coalition-seeks-to-block-additional-provisions-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] that a <a href = "http://www.azag.gov/LegalAZWorkersAct/">controversial Arizona employment law</a> [materials] that imposes penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants is not preempted by the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law says that an individual must be either <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/122939318.html">backed by a political party or collect at least 50,000 signatures</a> [AP report] to qualify as a presidential candidate. The previous law required that a potential candidate receive approval from an advisory board established by former president Saparmurat Niyazov. The Democratic Party of Turkmenistan (DPT), which was previously called the Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR, is the country's ruling and only legal political party. Current president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6346185.stm">Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov</a> [BBC profile] is the leader of that political party and is not expected to face challengers in the upcoming election.

<p>Turkmenistan has been undergoing a transitional phase as it attempts to emerge from its authoritarian past as part of the Soviet Union. Turkmenistan gained its independence upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The country <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/turkmenistan-adopts-new-constitution.php">adopted a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] in 2008, which envisioned a new multi-party political process and provided for limits on presidential power. Political reforms in Turkmenistan came after President-for-Life Saparmurat Niyazov, who remained in office for 21 years, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6199021.stm">died in 2006</a> [BBC obituary]. The government has been cited by the <a href="http://www.ihf-hr.org/index.php">International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] for widespread interference in judicial affairs, as well as using torture, and suppressing political opposition, the media, and civil society.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Violence has riddled the nation since last November's disputed election, after which Ouattara was eventually declared the winner. Gbagbo had to be forcefully removed from office and is currently <a href = "http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/11/ivory.coast.crisis/?hpt=T2">under the protection of UN personnel</a> [CNN report]. Despite both Gbagbo's and Ouattara's telling their forces to stop fighting, hostility continues, with HRW reporting approximately 150 murders by Ouattara supporters and 220 by Gbagbo supporters:<blockquote>In addition to killings, Human Rights Watch interviewed young men who had been detained by the Republican Forces and then released, and documented the arbitrary detention and inhumane treatment of scores more young men - often arrested for no other apparent reason than their age and ethnic group. Nearly every former detainee described being struck repeatedly with guns, belts, rope, and fists to extract information on where weapons were hidden or to punish them for alleged participation in the Young Patriots, a pro-Gbagbo militia group. Several described torture, including forcibly removing teeth from one victim and placing a burning hot knife on another victim, then cutting him.</blockquote>HRW recommended that Ouattara immediately investigate the killings and detainments, and cooperate with and seek aid from the international community and the UN. The report also asked the <a href = "http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to release a report on the violence, and the <A href = "http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unoci/">UN Operations in the Ivory Coast</a> [official website] to significantly increase their patrols and inspections of detention centers.

<p>Last month, Ouattara asked the <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/cote-divoire-president-asks-icc-to-launch-probe-into-crimes-after-disputed-november-election.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections last November. Chief Prosecutor <a href = "http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] then <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-to-begin-investigation-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">submitted a request to the court</a> [JURIST report] to begin an investigation into the Ivory Coast political conflict, but a formal investigation has yet to begin. In April, HRW <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also last month, the <a href = "http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House voted 67-29 and the Senate voted 25-7 to pass the bill that includes measures comparable to those <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">passed in Arizona</a> [JURIST report] last year. The bill permits police officers to detain a person stopped for a traffic violation if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the country illegally. The officer must then try to determine the individual's identity by checking other records if the motorist is unable to provide documentation. The bill also requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. The bill indicates that unlawful immigration increases education costs, crime, and economic hardship, and that the bill protects the public interest of Alabama citizens:<blockquote>The State of Alabama further finds that certain practices currently allowed in this state impede and obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law, undermine the security of our borders, and impermissibly restrict the privileges and immunities of the citizens of Alabama. Therefore, the people of the State of Alabama declare that it is a compelling public interest to discourage illegal immigration by requiring all agencies within this state to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. The State of Alabama also finds that other measures are necessary to ensure the integrity of various governmental programs and services.</blockquote> The bill will now proceed to Alabama <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] for signing.  

<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [official websites] and a coalition of other civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">filed a class action</a> [JURIST report] lawsuit challenging a similar Georgia immigration law</a>. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-coalition-seeks-to-block-additional-provisions-of-arizona-immigration-law.php">report</a>] an Arizona employment law that imposes penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text]. The ruling opens the door for states to enact similar restraints on immigration. Several states have already <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed</a> [JURIST reports] Arizona-style immigration laws. In March, the <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/">Oklahoma State Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would give police officers the authority to question the citizenship status of any person lawfully stopped for a traffic violation and arrest them without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally. Also in March, Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed</a> an immigration law requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor, but a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST reports] it less than 24 hours after it took effect. In February, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring suspected illegal immigrants to provide proof of their legal status and calls for all public meetings, websites, and documents to be in English only.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Characterized by many media outlets as "defiant," Mladic saluted several times through the proceedings, referred to himself as "General Mladic" and smiled at some survivors of the <a href = "/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">massacre of Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] who had come to watch the proceedings. Mladic, contesting the legitimacy of the court, refused to plead and requested a private audience to discuss his medical problems with the three-judge panel. He admitted that he received the indictment but had not read it and refused to let the court read it to him. Following the rules of The Hague, Judge Alphons Orie read his indictment regardless.

<p>Observers noted that Mladic appeared unable to use his right arm, and rumors have circulated that he has suffered two or three strokes and currently has cancer. Orie set a new court date for July 4, and said if Mladic refuses to plead then to the <A href = "http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/ind/en/mla-ai021010e.pdf">11 charges</a> [amended indictment, PDF] leveled against him, a not guilty plea will be entered. The court also determined there are <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=06&dd=03&nav_id=74718">no major factors to delay the trial</a> [B92 report].</p>

<p>Serbian authorities <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] last month, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague late Tuesday night</a> [JURIST reports]. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the massacre of Srebrenica during the <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report says that the government of Rwandan <a href="http://www.paulkagame.com/">President Paul Kagame</a> [official website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/689405.stm">profile</a>] has expressed a commitment to reviewing laws that criminalize criticism, but recent prosecution of journalists and other opposition leaders show that the situation has not changed. AI claims that Rwanda has broadly drafted hate speech laws passed since the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder] that are being used to criminalize legitimate criticism and expression that does not rise to the level of hate speech. The report claims that Kagame used restrictive regulatory and defamation laws to clampdown on newspaper criticism and that a prominent opposition candidate, Bernard Ntaganda, was prosecuted and jailed on politically motivated charges right before the last presidential election. The report says:<blockquote>[f]reedom of expression in Rwanda has been unduly restricted for many years. The months leading up to the August 2010 presidential elections, which [Kagame] won with 93 per cent of the vote, were marked by a clampdown on freedom of expression. The Rwandan government has expressed a commitment to review laws which criminalize criticism, but recent trials of journalists and opposition politicians suggest that Rwanda's clampdown on critics shows no sign of abating.</blockquote>The Kagame administration has <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/rwandaNews/idAFLDE7520SY20110603?sp=true">denied the claims</a> [Reuters report] in the report saying that Rwanda has a vibrant media community and political discourse. It calls the report inaccurate and partisan. 

<p>Last September, a Rwandan court sentenced <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AFR47/001/2010/en/5e17481a-0a18-4ac3-9228-374acfd2a8b7/afr470012010en.html">Deogratias Mushayidi</a> [AI backgrounder] to life in prison for recruiting rebels and trying to incite violence against the Kagame-led government. Mushayidi was the leader of the Pact for the Defence of the People, the former head of the Rwandan Journalists' Association and a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11350976">member of the ruling party</a> [BBC report] before becoming a vocal critic. In April 2010, Rwandan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] opposition presidential candidate <a href="http://www.victoire2010.com/english/index.html">Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza</a> [campaign website], accusing her of denying the 1994 genocide. The arrests come at a time when Kagame has received <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/02/10/rwanda-end-attacks-opposition-parties">criticism</a> [press release] from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] for his treatment of opposition parties. Last August, Peter Erlinder, former defense counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, <a href="/forum/2010/08/rwanda-flawed-elections-and-the-politics-of-genocide-denial.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that even though the White House has become more openly critical of Rwandan President Paul Kagame's regime, the US and international community at large must take a much closer look at those in power before true reconciliation will come to Rwanda. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The four men were <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1643331.php/Neo-Nazi-ideas-not-illegal-Spain-s-Supreme-Court-says">convicted</a> [DPA report] and sentenced to up to three and a half years in prison by a court in Barcelona in October 2009 for advocating genocide and belonging to an illegal association. The men had been <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/spanish-court-overturns-convictions-4-people-charged-spreading-124511499.html">selling books and materials</a> [AP report] that defended the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Holocaust">Holocaust</a> [JURIST news archive] from their bookstore and publishing house in Barcelona.

<p>Several countries have taken strong stances against neo-Nazi propaganda and hate crimes. In July 2010, a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-court-jails-neo-nazis-for-hate-crimes.php">sentenced 14 neo-Nazis</a> [JURIST report], including a group leader and several teenagers, to jail terms for committing hate crimes against ethnic minorities in the country. In November 2009, the German Federal Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-constitutional-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] legislation prohibiting public support and justification of the Nazi regime. The court reasoned that the restriction was necessary to protect public peace and the dignity of the victims of the Nazis, which it said were "supreme constitutional values" in Germany.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decided Thursday there is no conflict with the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> (AIA) [text] and that it can rule on two challenges to the <a href = "/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">health care reform</a> [text; JURIST <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>]. Last week, the court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/fourth-circuit-questions-authority-to-hear-health-care-law-challenge.php">requested briefs</a> from all parties in <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">Liberty v. Geithner</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">Commonwealth of Virginia v. Sebelius</a> [JURIST reports] explaining whether the individual mandate can be considered a "tax" under the Act regardless if it is a "tax" for Article I purposes. Although the Obama administration had previously argued that the AIA barred suits against health care reform, they discarded this argument in their <a href = "http://www.scribd.com/doc/56820439/Liberty-v-Geithner-Govt-Supplemental-Brief">briefs</a> [Liberty text; <a href = "http://www.scribd.com/doc/56821264/Commv-Sebelius-Govt-Supp-Brief">Sebelius text</a>] and stated the case should proceed.<blockquote>In the district courts, the government argued for dismissal of these actions under the AIA. On further reflection, and on consideration of the decisions rendered thus far in the ACA litigation, the United States has concluded that the AIA does not foreclose the exercise of jurisdiction in these cases. Unique attributes of the text and structure of the ACA indicate that Congress did not intend to dictate a single pathway to judicial review of Section 5000A - i.e., failure to maintain minimum essential coverage starting more than two and a half years from now, in January 2014; payment of the tax penalty starting nearly four years from now, in April 2015; and, only then, commencement of an action seeking a tax refund.</blockquote>In their <a href = "http://www.scribd.com/doc/56820515/Liberty-v-Geithner-Liberty-Supp-Brief">brief</a> [text], <a href = "http://www.liberty.edu/">Liberty University</a> [academic website] argued that the fines levied under health care reform do not constitute a tax and that judicial review was the only way to challenge health care reform. Virginia made <a href = "http://www.scribd.com/doc/56817787/Virginia-s-Obamacare-Brief-to-the-Fourth-Circuit">similar arguments</a> [text]. Liberty University's lawsuit appeals a decision to dismiss its challenge of the individual mandate, while Virginia is seeking to uphold a ruling that it is unconstitutional.

<p>The Fourth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the two cases last month. Earlier this week, the <a href = "http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-hears-challenge-to-health-care-law-individual-mandate.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a similar challenge. The Sixth Circuit had previously asked the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/sixth-circuit-asks-health-care-challengers-to-explain-why-they-can-sue.php">whether the court had jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to hear a challenge before the effective date of the law. Last month, the <a href = "http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] sought to have its challenge reinstated in the <a href = "http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] after it was dismissed by the lower court. Last February, the US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) asked federal judge Roger Vinson to clarify that states must continue to enact the health care reform law as the government appeals from Vinson's January ruling <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">finding the law unconstitutional</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

US prosecutors said they <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-03/u-s-asks-federal-judge-to-reinstate-corporate-campaign-donation-charges.html">failed to cite key precedent</a> [Bloomberg report] related to campaign finance, therefore District Judge James Cacheris did not have enough information to rule that the ban on direct corporate financing was unconstitutional. In May, Cacheris dismissed a criminal count against two men charged with illegally <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/va-judge-rules-against-us-ban-on-direct-corporate-contributions-to-candidates/2011/05/27/AGEPEpCH_story.html">reimbursing individuals for almost $200,000 in contributions</a> [WP report] to Hillary Clinton's 2006 senate and 2008 presidential primary campaign. In dismissing the count, Cacheris stated that the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html">Citizens United</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>] had dissolved the legal underpinnings for the federal ban against direct contributions from corporations to a candidate. The US attorneys asked Cacheris to consider <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-403.ZS.html">Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont</a> [opinion], where the Supreme Court specifically upheld a ban on corporate contributions to election campaigns.

<p>Campaign finance regulation has been in a state of flux since <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> was decided in January of last year. In May, the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/11/05/103126P.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-minnesota-campaign-finance-law.php">report</a>] a Minnesota campaign financing law prohibiting direct contributions to candidates and affiliated entities. A judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] in April <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-upholds-wisconsin-supreme-court-campaign-finance-law.php">dismissed two challenges</a> [JURIST report] to campaign financing schemes for Wisconsin Supreme Court elections. Last March, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in two consolidated campaign finance cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-238.pdf">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] forbids states from providing publicly financed candidates with additional government subsidies, which are triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates or by the candidates' privately financed opponents. In McComish v. Bennett, the court will determine whether Arizona's matching funds law and a law regulating campaign financing to equalize resources among candidates and interest groups, rather than advancing a compelling state interest in the least restrictive manner, violate the First and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcrack.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] Thursday <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/06/02/09-50315.pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] a prisoner's attempt to have new crack cocaine sentencing guidelines applied retroactively to reduce his sentence. The three-judge panel found that it could not infer congressional intent to apply the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1789:">Fair Sentencing Act</a> [S 1789 materials] to prisoners already convicted and serving the prior mandatory minimum. The Fair Sentencing Act amended existing law to reduce the current sentencing ratio from 100:1 to 18:1 to make it more in line with the penalties for powder cocaine. Lyndon Marlon Baptist, a.k.a. L-Dog, was convicted for facilitating a sale of 14 grams of crack cocaine between his cousin and an informant. The district court judge sentenced him to the mandatory minimum of five years in prison, saying the punishment was disproportionate to the crime and morally wrong. The Ninth Circuit said that the emergency powers Congress granted to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/">US Sentencing Commission</a> (USSC) [official website] to implement the new law did not mean it was supposed to apply retroactively. Nor could such intent be inferred from a <a href="http://www.fd.org/pdf_lib/fair-sentencing-act-ag-holder-letter-111710%5B1%5D.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] sent by the sponsors of the law to US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] asking him to apply the law's "modified mandatory minimums to all defendants who have not yet been sentenced, including those whose conduct predates the legislation's enactment." The court said the letter in effect conceded that it was not supposed to apply to those already serving sentences. Further, Baptist's constitutional claims of cruel and unusual punishment and an equal protection violation were rejected as such claims consistently have been by the courts. Thus, the court said it was compelled to find the Fair Sentencing Act's lower sentences could not apply retroactively. But the judges expressed their reluctance in their holding:<blockquote>As individual judges, we believe that the result that we reach in this case&#8212;affirming a sentence of sixty months' imprisonment for a minor drug offense under a law that Congress appears to have concluded was groundless and racially discriminatory&#8212;subverts justice and erodes the legitimacy of the criminal justice system. We are without power, however, to undo the injustice that we are compelled to authorize when we affirm the congressionally mandated sentence that the district judge understandably declared made his "stomach hurt[ ]" because it was "disproportionate [with respect to] African Americans" and "wrong from a moral sense."</blockquote> All the circuit courts that have heard such challenges have held that the Fair Sentencing Act is not meant to apply retroactively. 

<p>Earlier this week, Holder testified before the USSC <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/holder-calls-for-retroactive-application-of-crack-sentencing-law.php">urging them to apply the Fair Sentencing Act retroactively</a> [JURIST report]. He argued "there is simply no just or logical reason why their punishments should be dramatically more severe than those of other cocaine offenders." The USSC is considering retroactively applying the Fair Sentencing Act ,which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-signs-bill-to-reduce-cocaine-sentencing-disparity.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama last year. Under the existing law passed in 1986, an individual possessing five grams of crack cocaine would receive a mandatory five-year prison sentence, while an individual possessing powder cocaine would need to have 100 times that amount to receive the same sentence. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/28/us-end-sight-infamous-crack-cocaine">praised</a> [press release] the bill's passage, stating that the old law also created a racial disparity, with African Americans comprising 79.8 percent of all offenders sentenced for crack cocaine violations. In April 2008, a study released by the USSC reported that more than 3,000 prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">had their sentences reduced</a> [JURIST report] under an amendment to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelin.htm">Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials]. In 2007, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-sentencing-panel-backs-retroactive.php">USSC voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to give retroactive effect to an earlier sentencing guideline amendment that reduced crack cocaine penalties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

UNCHR spokesperson, Adrian Edwards, said that Qatar violated international law by deporting Al Obeidi after she was ruled a refugee by the UNHCR and in its custody. Al Obeidi was prevented by Qatar government forces from leaving with the UNHCR for Romania and instead diverted to a plane bound for Libya. Al Obeidi is <a href = "http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-jun-2-2011-2354">currently in Benghazi</a> [Al-Jazeera Blog report] under the <a href = "http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/06/03/libya.rape.case/">protection of the rebel government</a> [CNN report], the <a href = "http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transition Council</a> [political website]. Al Obeidi became internationally known when she entered the Rixos Hotel on March 26 and told the international press corps that she had been stopped at a checkpoint by <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi's</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Gaddafi">news archive</a>] forces and beaten and gang-raped for 2 days. CNN had the exclusive interview:

<p>Libyan government spokesperson Mussa Ibrahim stated that those she accused of rape are <a href = "http://gu.com/p/2z462">pursuing charges against her</a> [Guardian report] for a wrongful accusation and that any investigations had been dropped due to Al Obeidi refusing a medical examination. Qatar has not responded to any of the criticism, nor explained their decision to deport her.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a three-person commission for the <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] appointed to investigate violence in Libya <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] saying that government forces have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes under orders from Libyan leader Mummar Gaddafi and other high-ranking officials. Last month, <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo announced he is <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">seeking arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Gaddafi and two others in his "inner circle" on charges of crimes against humanity. Ocampo has since sent a letter to Libyan Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi, warning against diplomats covering up crimes for Gaddafi. Further, Ocampo alleged that cover-ups in Libya go so far that any trace of a crime is destroyed. Ocampo revealed in April that his office had <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icc-prosecutor-claims-to-have-evidence-gaddafi-planned-attacks-on-civilians.php">uncovered evidence</a> [JURIST report] that Gaddafi planned to attack civilians to forestall regime-toppling revolution. Ocampo indicated that the plans were made in response to the conflicts in Tunisia and Egypt and included shooting civilians. In March, Ocampo told the press that he was 100 percent certain his office would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/icc-prosecutor-certain-of-gaddafi-war-crimes-charges.php">bring charges</a> [JURIST report] against Gaddafi. Also in March, the ICC launched a probe into <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">allegations of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] by the Libyan government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 19 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] outlines the types of restrictions that would be considered breaches of party states' obligations to guarantee the right to freedom of expression. UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">Frank LaRue</a> [official profile] provided examples of governments restricting, controlling, manipulating and censoring Internet content without any legal basis. LaRue suggested that, because of the unique features of the Internet, governments have increased restrictions on Internet use out of fear of mobilization and rapid dissemination of information. The report suggested that Internet restrictions stifle other fundamental rights:<blockquote>The right to freedom of opinion and expression is as much a fundamental right on its own accord as it is an "enabler" of other rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to education and the right to take part in cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, as well as civil and political rights, such as the rights to freedom of association and assembly. Thus, by acting as a catalyst for individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Internet also facilitates the realization of a range of other human rights.</blockquote>LaRue acknowledged that there are some exceptions to the right to freedom of expression, namely types of expression that infringe on the rights of others, like child pornography, hate speech and defamation.

<p>LaRue <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10949&LangID=E">called on Algeria</a> [press release] in April to "guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression" including decriminalizing defamation, but <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-expert-urges-algeria-to-guarantee-freedom-of-expression.php">praised government efforts to provide Internet access</a> [JURIST report] to eight million through libraries and public centers. In January, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for Hungary to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/protests-over-restrictive-hungarian-media-law-2011-01-14">amend its new media law</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/rights-groups-urges-hungary-to-amend-new-media-law.php">report</a>] that had caused outbreaks of public protests in Budapest and Vienna. The law had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hungary-defends-controversial-media-law-in-face-of-eu-criticism.php">harshly criticized by members of the media</a> [JURIST report], as well as other European governments, as too restrictive of free expression. In December, the <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/">National Assembly of Venezuela</a> [official website, in Spanish] passed the <a href="http://www.asambleanacional.gob.ve/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=2771&tmpl=component&format=raw&Itemid=185&lang=es">Social Responsibility Law</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/venezuela-passes-law-banning-certain-internet-content.php">report</a>], which bans Internet content that promotes unrest among citizens or challenges legally established authorities. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] in March 2010 released its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/index.htm">2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials] and the DOS <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/us-state-department-releases-2009.php">criticized China</a> [JURIST report] for its increased Internet censorship.

Friday marked the twenty-second anniversary of the suppression of the protests in Tiananmen Square.  The DOS also asked the Chinese government to provide an account of those missing, detained or killed during the suppression. The US encouraged the Chinese government to protect universal human rights of peaceful dissenters and to release all that are detained, forcibly disappeared, or placed under house arrest in recent months. According to the right's group <a href="http://chrdnet.org/">Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [advocacy website], the Chinese government has <a href="http://chrdnet.org/2011/06/02/twenty-two-years-after-tiananmen-massacre-worst-repression-in-a-generation/">implemented</a> [press release] the "most severe repression of dissent and activism since the post-Tiananmen crackdown," and has arrested and detained at least 48 individuals in the months leading up to the anniversary. A spokesperson for the Chinese government rejected the US statement saying that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hlTTL2ucWE4Eu9H-vQwgSjwCI-Kg?docId=85285aabdd254264b7756fccf4dcc2d7">US was interfering</a> [AP report] with China's internal affairs, and that Chinese citizens enjoy extensive rights and freedoms.  

<p>China's human rights record has been widely criticized.  In March, <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/un-panel-urges-china-to-release-detained-human-rights-lawyer.php">called on the Chinese government</a> [JURIST report] to free detained human rights lawyer<a href="http://www.freegao.com/"> Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zhisheng">news archive</a>], whom they claim is being held in violation of international law. Last year detained Chinese human rights activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] as the winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. The Chinese government denounced the decision, calling it "contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Prize." In February 2010, a Chinese appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Liu's 11-year prison sentence despite calls for his release from US and EU officials. Liu was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/china-rights-activist-tried-for.php">tried</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009 on subversion charges in a trial that lasted only two hours and was closed to foreign diplomats. Liu was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/china-rights-activist-arrested-for.php%5C">formally arrested</a> in June 2009 and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/china-prosecutors-formally-charge.php">charged</a> [JURIST reports] in December, but he has been in detention since December 2008, shortly before the petition's release. In June 2009, rights groups marked the twentieth anniversary of the 1989 uprising in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, calling for the government to <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rights-advocates-urge-reform-on-20th.php">investigate the incident</a> [JURIST report] and implement changes called for by Charter 08.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaclu.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/"> American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/pdfs/2011-06-ACLUElectionComplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/index.cfm?action=viewRelease&emailAlertID=3930">press release</a>] on Friday in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] challenging a new state voting law. The suit was filed by the ACLU in conjunction with the voter's rights group <a href="http://www.projectvote.org/">Project Vote</a> [advocacy website], and it seeks to block implementation of <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=46845&SessionId=66">HB 1355</a> [materials]. HB 1355 limits the window for early voting to one week prior to an election, down from the previously established two weeks, and imposes a series of additional regulations on organizations that enlist new voters, including requiring that they register with the state, submit periodic reports and file voter registration materials within 48 hours of completion. It also requires voters that have moved between any of the state's counties to use provisional ballots if they wish to update their information while at a polling location. The suit alleges that the Florida law violates the federal <a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [text] because it failed to meet VRA requirement that a state law "seeking to administer or implement any voting qualifications or prerequisites to voting, or standards, practices, or procedures with respect to voting that are different from those that were in force or effect on November 1, 1972" submit the law for preclearance by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] before it can take effect. The suit requests that the implementation of HB 1355 be blocked if it is found the legislation "will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or membership in a language minority, [and] diminish the ability of minorities to elect their preferred candidates of choice." The ACLU is requesting that a three judge panel hear the suit.

<p>The controversial Florida legislation was signed in to law in May by <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> (R) [official website] after the Florida legislature <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/florida-legislature-approves-election-law-revisions.php">approved the bill </a>[JURIST report] earlier in the month. Similar pieces of legislation have recently been challenged, with varying results. In May, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the state's 2006 Photo ID Act that requires voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. The court ruled that the law "does not deprive any Georgia voter from casting a ballot in any election," and that presenting valid identification does not represent an unconstitutional impediment to voting. In contrast, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] in October <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. The court held that the law was inconsistent with the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/42usc/subch_ih.php">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA) [materials], which was passed with the intent of increasing voter registration and removing barriers to registration imposed by the states. The NVRA requires voters to attest to the validity of the information on their registration forms, including their citizenship, but does not require them to provide additional proof of citizenship. The law exceeded the federal statute, requiring applicants to show proof before registering to vote.<br />

Sudanese troops invaded Abyei in May and have occupied the area since, causing an estimated 45,000 residents to flee the embattled area. The troops have looted and ransacked much of the area, including UN food stores and facilities. In their statement, the Council: 
<blockquote>[S]trongly condemns the Government of Sudan's taking and continued maintenance of military control over the Abyei area and the resulting displacement of tens of thousands of residents of Abyei. The Council calls on the Sudanese Armed Forces to ensure an immediate halt to all looting, burning and illegal resettlement. The Council stresses that all those responsible for violations of international law, including humanitarian and human rights law, as well as those who ordered those acts, will be held accountable. The Council expresses grave concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the area.</blockquote>
The Council has said it will meet in the coming days to discuss the implementation of the statement.

<p>The Council is not the first to call on leaders of both the northern and southern regions of Sudan to remove troops from the Abyei area. In May, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11053&LangID=E">peaceful resolution</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-peaceful-resolution-of-sudan-conflict.php">report</a>] to the escalating conflict in Abyei. North Sudan's president, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile], has stated he will not withdraw troops from the region and insisted that the area belongs to the north. South Sudan is scheduled to become an independent nation in a matter of weeks. A total of <a href="http://southernsudan2011.com/">98.83 percent</a> [SSRC materials] of nearly 3.8 million southern Sudanese voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/sudan-referendum-voters-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-secession.php">voted for secession</a> [JURIST report] in January's Southern Sudan's Independence Referendum, according to the final polling results released by the <a href="http://www.ssrc.sd/SSRC2/index.php">Southern Sudan Referendum Commission</a> [official website]. After the official results were announced in the northern capital of Khartoum, al-Bashir, who campaigned against secession, issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/sudan-president-accepts-southern-sudans-vote-for-independance.php">formal decree accepting the result</a> [JURIST report] of the referendum. With the South's secession, the world's 193rd country will be announced on July 9 in the southern capital of Juba.<br />

Ban cited 70 deaths in the last week, disturbing reports of the deaths of children under torture, live ammunition and shelling in his statement.

The bill adds the following definition:<blockquote>"Gender identity or expression" means a person's gender-related identity, appearance or behavior, whether or not that gender-related identity, appearance or behavior is different from that traditionally associated with the person's physiology or assigned sex at birth, which gender-related identity can be shown by providing evidence including, but not limited to, medical history, care or treatment of the gender-related identity, consistent and uniform assertion of the gender-related identity or any other evidence that the gender-related identity is sincerely held, part of a person's core identity or not being asserted for an improper purpose.</blockquote>The bill passed the House of Representatives last month. The <a href="http://www.ctfamily.org/">Family Institute of Connecticut Action</a> [advocacy website], an opponent of the legislation, dubbed it the "Bathroom Bill" and strongly <a href="http://www.votervoice.net/core.aspx?AID=274&Screen=alert&IssueId=25382&APP=GAC&SiteID=-1&VV_CULTURE=en-us">criticized</a> [press release] its passage. <a href="http://www.governor.ct.gov/malloy/site/default.asp">Governor Dannel Malloy</a> (D) [official website] <a href="http://www.governor.ct.gov/malloy/cwp/view.asp?Q=480522&A=4010">issued a statement</a> [press release] lauding the bill's passage, saying that it is a "step forward in the fight for equal rights for all of Connecticut's citizens, and it's the right thing to do," and that he will sign it into law. Upon signing the legislation, Connecticut will become the fifteenth state to offer protections for gender identity.

<p>Protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a divisive political issue. Homosexuality remains a criminal offense in more than 70 countries around the world, and statistics show that <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hate-crimes-against-lgbt-people-rise-worldwide-un-rights-chief.php">anti-LGBT crimes are on the rise</a> [JURIST report] worldwide. In the US, these crimes, in addition to the absence of state protection against employment discrimination, have been estimated to <a href="/dateline/2011/05/edward-sanfilippo-transgender-discrimination.php">cost states millions of dollars annually</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Nationally, measures have been taken to stop hate crimes against LGBT individuals. In March, US <a href="http://polis.house.gov/">Representative Jared Polis</a> (D-CO) and <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Al Franken</a> (D-MN) [official websites] introduced legislation to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-legislators-introduce-bill-ending-bullying-in-federally-funded-schools.php">protect LGBT students from bullying</a> [JURIST report] in federally funded public elementary and high schools. In 2009, US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-defense-authorization-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a bill that contained a measure extending the definition of federal hate crimes to include crimes motivated by gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW called on the National Transitional Council (NTC), the opposition ruling body in Libya with de facto control over eastern Libya, to provide civilian detainees with full due process rights, access to counsel, and the ability to challenge their detention before independent judicial authorities. HRW also called on the NTC to reign in the various volunteer security groups under a centralized civilian authority that may also investigate alleged abuses of detainees. The rights group, which was given unrestricted access to rebel-held detainees, documented four civilian detainees alleging physical abuse during capture, and one civilian detained by a volunteer security group that was apparently tortured to death while in custody. HRW stated:<blockquote>There is no excuse to delay the rule of law in areas under opposition control. The authorities should rein in volunteer security groups, establish a clear civilian authority for criminal justice, and make sure detainees get full due process rights. The people of Libya are all too familiar with arbitrary arrests and detention without charge from four decades of Muammar Gaddafi's rule. The opposition authorities should reject that abusive legacy and create a legal framework to ensure respect for Libyan and international law.</blockquote>NTC officials say it recognizes the problems and is working to correct them. Opposition forces are estimated to have 330 people in custody, some of which were fighters loyal to Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], and others were civilians suspected of pro-Gaddafi activities.

<p>On the other side of the conflict, a three-person commission for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] appointed to investigate violence in Libya published a report Wednesday finding that Gaddafi's forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">committed crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] and war crimes under orders from Gaddafi and other high-ranking officials. The commission's 92-page report said Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances, and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." Last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official websites] announced he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">seeking arrest warrants for Gaddafi</a> [JURIST report] and two others in his inner circle on charges of crimes against humanity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.26.Add.5_AEV.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] by UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/women/rapporteur/docs/RashidaManjoo.doc">Special Rapporteur Rashida Manjoo</a> [official profile, DOC] has said that there is a continued prevalence of violence and discriminatory treatment of women in the US, with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. The 28-page report, delivered Wednesday, says the US has taken some positive steps with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) first passed in 1994 and the passage of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ079.108.pdf">Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003</a> (PREA) [text, PDF]. But the report concludes that a lack of substantive protective legislation at both the federal and state levels combined with the poor implementation of current laws is resulting in the continued prevalence of violence against women and a discrimination against victims, particularly affecting women in the military, women in detention, Native American women and other women in poor and/or immigrant communities:<blockquote>The government has taken positive legislative and policy initiatives to reduce the prevalence of violence against women, including the enactment and subsequent reauthorizations of the Violence against  Women Act, and the establishment of dedicated offices on violence against women at the highest level of the Executive. The  government has also allocated substantial resources which are beneficial to advocates and service providers, particularly at the grassroots level... It is clear that multiple forms of discrimination against certain groups of women not only makes them more vulnerable, but also  exacerbates the negative consequences that violence has upon them. Thus the implementation of current policy and programmatic initiatives must address the persistent structural challenges which are often both the causes and consequences of violence against women.</blockquote>The report further says that rates of abuse against women are higher among the African American, Native American and immigrant communities. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which assisted Manjoo in the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/un-expert-violence-against-women-says-us-victims-still-encounter-discrimination-and">fact-finding</a> [press release], called on the US to do more to protect women. Sandra Park with the ACLU's Women's Rights Project said, "[w]e hope that the government heeds the Special Rapporteur's call to improve policies and protect victims to end this vicious cycle of violence once and for all." 

<p>Domestic violence continues to be a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/council-of-europe-launches-international-treaty-to-combat-violence-against-women.php">global problem</a> [JURIST report]. A 2010 Human Rights Watch report <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uae-domestic-violence-ruling-a-violation-of-treaty-obligations-hrw.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a United Arabic Emirates practice of a "husband['s] right to discipline his wife." The report noted that women in these countries still face many obstacles in achieving equality, and, despite some progress, women in the region still have little recourse for domestic violence and face discrimination in employment, education and politics. In August 2009, <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/pakistan-lower-house-passes-bill.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST report] instituted the <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/private_bills/prevention_domestic_violence_12082008.pdf">Prevention of Domestic Violence Act</a>, 2008 [text, PDF], moving a step closer to outlawing domestic violence in the country by protecting women, children and domestic employees from mental, physical, and sexual abuse. Also in 2009, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/europe-court-rules-turkish-government.php">ruled </a>[JURIST report] that the Turkish government was responsible for the death of a woman at the hands of her ex-husband because it failed to investigate complaints. In 2008, the <a href="http://wcd.nic.in/">India Ministry of Women and Child Development</a> (WCD) [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/india-government-to-review-anti-dowry.php">review </a>[JURIST report] the country's controversial <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/3259965.stm">anti-dowry act</a> [BBC backgrounder] because increasing numbers of Indian women had issued complaints about misuse. Despite legislation controlling the cultural and religious practice, India's dowry system continues illegally, leaving many women subject to abuse without enforcement of legal protections from so-called "dowry deaths". In 2006, the <a href="http://www.coe.int/DEFAULT.ASP?">Council of Europe</a> (COE) [official website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/france-justice-minister-claims.php">report criticizing</a> [JURIST report] France's human rights record and identifying impunity for domestic violence as a shortcoming in the French judicial system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

More than 3,000 Americans signed a <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/Final%20Petition%20Deportations.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] sent to the president on Thursday, claiming that deportees are immediately imprisoned upon return to Haiti and can suffer illness-related deaths as a result of the unsanitary and inhumane conditions of the jails. Since the earthquake in January 2010, Haiti has suffered from a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/situation/">cholera epidemic</a> [CDC backgrounder] resulting in more than 5,300 deaths, adding to the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/inter-american-commission-orders-united-states-stop-deportations-cholera-stricken-haiti">conditions</a> [CCR press release] inmates endure without guarantee of medicine, food or water.

Though many of the deportees have been convicted of serious crimes, advocates urge that deporting hundreds of people back to a country strewn with tent cities plagued with disease and violence over recent elections is <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/national/2011-01-12/story/haitian-deportations-called-death-sentences">too great of a punishment</a> [Florida Times-Union article]. The petition states:<blockquote>As international aid agencies end their service contracts, over a million people remain homeless in tent camps and face chronic hunger, threats of eviction, and lack of essentials such as water and medical care. ... No one should be deported to Haiti during this humanitarian crisis. ... Please live up to your pledge to uphold human rights and halt these inhumane and cruel deportations to Haiti.</blockquote>The letter came a day after the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] ordered Obama to halt the deportations, following up on a similar <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/Comunicados/English/2011/6-11eng.htm">order</a> [press release] from February.

<p>In April, the US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">released </a>[JURIST report] its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Report on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials], reporting that <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/wha/154509.htm">Haiti</a> [materials] has faced significant human rights abuses, following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/haiti-confronts-rising-lawlessness.php">breakdown of government control</a> [JURIST report] after the 2010 earthquake.

The <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/d9nmboro0/bahraini-doctors-and-nurses-who-treated-injured-protesters-face-trial-in-gulf-kingdom.html">doctors and nurses were stationed</a> [AP report] primarily at the <a href="http://www.moh.gov.bh/EN/HealthEstablishment/SMC.aspx">Salmaniya Medical Complex</a> [official website], a state-run center in Bahrain's capital, Manama, when protests calling for democratic change erupted in early February. The doctors and nurses asserted that they had professional obligations to treat injured protesters and providing medical assistance to anti-government protesters was not tantamount to participating in the anti-government protests. Though Bahrain <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-lifts-state-of-emergency-as-king-calls-for-national-dialogue.php">lifted state of emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] last week, the court, composed of military prosecutors and military and civilian judges, held the closed hearing under emergency law. The health professionals were also charged with harming the public by spreading false news and denying medical attention.

In March, six <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">opposition leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] in Bahrain after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in Manana. Days earlier, Bahraini King <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">three-month state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">called on the King to impose martial law</a> [JURIST report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF].

Vice</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-retaliation-protection-attorneys-fees.php">report</a>] that it is improper to award defendants the full amount of attorney's fees incurred while defending non-frivolous claims along with a frivolous claim. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001988----000-.html">42 USC &#167; 1988</a> [text] permits courts to award defendants attorney's fees for defending against a frivolous claim, even when the plaintiff also asserts non-frivolous claims. The court interpreted &#167; 1988 as permitting the defendant to receive "only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for the frivolous claim." In 2005, petitioner Ricky Fox sued Billy Ray Vice for defamation and interfering with his right to seek public office when Fox ran for police chief of Vinton, Louisiana against incumbent Vice. Fox ultimately won the election despite Vice's attempts to upset Fox's campaign, but asserted both state-law and federal claims against Vice. The US <a href="http://www.lawd.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the Western District of Louisiana</a> [official website] granted Vice's motion for summary judgment of the federal claims on the basis that the claims were frivolous, and subsequently declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the residual state-law claims. The district court granted Vice attorney's fees for the entire action without separating out the work the attorney completed for the viable state-law claims, and the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C08/08-31135-CV0.wpd.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF]. In her opinion, Justice Elena Kagan articulated the standard:<blockquote>Our legal system generally requires each party to bear his own litigation expenses, including attorney's fees, regardless whether he wins or loses. Indeed, this principle is so firmly entrenched that it is known as the "American Rule." [...] That remains true when the plaintiff's suit also includes non-frivolous claims. The defendant, of course, is not entitled to any fees arising from these non-frivolous charges. But the presence of reasonable allegations in a suit does not immunize the plaintiff against paying for the fees that his frivolous claims imposed.</blockquote>Because the district court failed to follow this standard, the court accordingly vacated the judgment of the appeals court and remanded the case for further consistent proceedings.

<p>The Supreme Court ultimately adopted a "but for" test for determining precisely the fees for which a losing party is responsible. In other words, a prevailing defendant may receive fees that would not have been incurred "but for" having to defend against the additional federal claim or claims. During <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-114.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF] the justices discussed the merits of the "but for" test. The lower court had applied the "attributable exclusively" test, whereby prevailing defendants could receive those fees exclusively attributable to the frivolous federal claim. Counsel for the petitioner Fox argued that the lower court decision violated Congress' intention "to protect defendants from the lying or the vexatious plaintiff who shouldn't be in court at all." Counsel for the respondent Vice argued that the federal statute rightly allows for defendants to receive attorney's fees from plaintiffs, even if the plaintiff wins the case, if the plaintiff filed any frivolous claims.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-class-certification-sentencing-laws.php">report</a>] that a federal sentencing court must determine whether "an offense under State law" is a "serious drug offense" under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000924----000-.html">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [18 USC &#167; 924] by consulting the "maximum term of imprisonment" applicable to a defendant's prior state drug offense at the time of the defendant's conviction for that offense. Clifton McNeill was arrested in 2007 after police discovered a firearm and 3.1 grams of cocaine during a search incident to arrest for eluding a traffic stop. In light of previous drug convictions in 1992 and 1995, McNeill was convicted under the ACCA. The previous convictions and sentencing structure met the definitions of a "serious drug offense" at the time they were committed, but the statutory sentences for those offenses were reduced in later years and do not currently meet the ACCA definition. The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/McNeill-v.-US-4th-Cir.-Opinion.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the ACCA still applied regardless of the subsequent statutory changes. The Supreme Court affirmed the appeal court's ruling. Justice Clarence Thomas indicated in his opinion that the statute's plain meaning provides the basis for the court's decision:<blockquote>The plain text of ACCA requires a federal sentencing court to consult the maximum sentence applicable to a defendant's previous drug offense at the time of his conviction for that offense. The statute requires the court to determine whether a "previous conviction" was for a serious drug offense. The only way to answer this backward-looking question is to consult the law that applied at the time of that conviction.</blockquote>Furthermore, despite present-tense language in the statute, the Court determined that the applicable law is that which was in place at the time of the conviction.

<p>Beginning October 1, 1994, North Carolina reduced the maximum sentence for selling cocaine from 10 years to 38 months and the maximum sentence for possessing cocaine with intent to sell to 30 months. Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/06/02/09-50315.pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/a-us-appeals-court-holds-fair-sentencing-act-is-not-retroactive.php">report</a>] a prisoner's attempt to have new crack cocaine sentencing guidelines applied retroactively to reduce his sentence. The three-judge panel found that it could not infer congressional intent to apply the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1789:">Fair Sentencing Act</a> [S 1789 materials] to prisoners already convicted and serving the prior mandatory minimum.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1001.htm">Martinez v. Ryan</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Mart.-USSCPetition020211.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will decide whether a defendant has a right to effective assistance of counsel in the first post-conviction appeal at which the defendant could raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the trial. Martinez was convicted on two sexual assault counts related to the alleged rape of his stepdaughter and is serving consecutive sentences of 35 to life. During the pendency of his direct appeal, his counsel brought a collateral attack against his conviction by filing a petition for post-conviction relief. The petition did not raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial despite mistakes by Martinez's counsel including a failure to object to expert witness testimony that was inadmissible under state law. Under Arizona law, the post-conviction relief petition was the first place Martinez could raise such a claim. Martinez brought a second action for post-conviction relief, but the Arizona state courts found the claim to be procedurally barred because of a failure to raise it in the first petition. Martinez is seeking federal review of whether he can bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his appeal counsel for failure to raise the same claim against his trial counsel. Martinez argues that since the right to effective assistance of counsel extends to the first tier of review, he should be able to challenge his post-conviction relief petition because that was the first opportunity for him to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Martinez-CA9-Opinion.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that since there is no right to appointment of counsel during a defendant's post-conviction relief petition there is no right to effective assistance of counsel.

<p>The court also granted <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-879.htm">Kurns v. Railroad Friction Prods. Corp.</a> [docket], which deals with the preemption of state court products liability claims relating to the death of an individual exposed to asbestos. George Corson worked for various railroad companies where much of his duties included removing insulation from locomotive boilers and putting brake shoes on locomotives. His estate brought claims against multiple defendants including a claim against <a href="http://www.rfpc.com/default.asp">Railroad Friction Products Corporation</a> (RFCP) [corporate website] over brake pads they manufactured containing asbestos. The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] affirmed the district court's finding on summary judgment that <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca3/09-1634/920100909/">claims were preempted</a> [opinion, text] by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode49/usc_sec_49_00020701----000-.html">Locomotive Inspection Act</a> [49 USC &#167; 20701].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Roche Molecular Systems</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that federal law does not automatically vest title of inventions from federally funded research in the university through which the research is being conducted. The 7-2 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts held that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/usc_sup_01_35_10_II_20_18.html">Bayh-Doyle Act</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 200-212], which vests patent rights to universities for inventions from federally funded research, did not give <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> [academic website] superior rights to the invention of its employee and thus, the employee could transfer his invention rights to a third party. Dr. Mark Holodniy, while employed by Stanford, began working with a company now owned by <a href="http://www.roche-diagnostics.us/about/rd_dms.htm">Roche Molecular Systems</a> [official website] to develop a method to test for HIV in an individual's blood stream. As part of his agreement to work with the company he transferred title to his inventions to the company. Roche marketed the method but Stanford argued that it infringed on its patents. The Court interpreted &#167; 202 of the Act saying federal contractors may "elect to retain title" to mean that the Stanford must have already had an interest in the invention, and that the Act could not be used to acquire such a title from the inventor. The Court said that the Act was not meant to override pre-existing patent law premised on the principle that rights to an invention belong to the inventor. It said Stanford's construction would allow it to claim title over inventions that were conceived before the employee began working for the university or allow it to claim title as long as 1 dollar of federal funding went toward the invention. 

<p>Stanford argued during <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-definition-of-cocaine-base-patent-rights.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] that since Dr. Holodniy was an employee of Stanford and working on a project partially funded with federal money that he was precluded from being able to sign away his rights to the invention. accepted assertion that while the Bayh-Dole Act purported to put patents into the market, it did not change the long-standing rule "that title to an invention vests in the inventor, subject to assignment, not in the inventor's employer." However, counsel for Stanford further argued that the Bayh-Dole act should be read straight-forwardly, and not in relation to the general rule. Roche responded that, "Congress worked a highly transformative change in the law of patent ownership and assignment and did it in a very obscure and indirect way ... [creating] this brand-new vesting rule." The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1509r.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that Roche possesses an ownership interest in the patents at issue, depriving Stanford's standing to sue.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Halliburton</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-class-certification-sentencing-laws.php">report</a>] that, though a party to a private securities fraud action must demonstrate that the defendant';s misrepresentation caused economic loss, securities fraud plaintiffs do not need to prove loss causation for class certification. Erica P John Fund (EPJ Fund) sought class certification in a suit to recover investors' losses from Halliburton. Halliburton, according to EPJ Fund, made misstatements about its financial position which, when revealed to be false, caused Halliburton's stock price to fall. The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/08/08-11195-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that investor losses need to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence at the class certification stage prior to full discovery in order for the class action lawsuit to proceed. The Supreme Court disagreed. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3)</a> [text] requires that, for a class satisfying Rule 23(a) to be certified, "the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy." Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5589356734421689123&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Basic v. Levinson</a> [opinion] where the Court held that an investor presumptively relies on a defendant's misrepresentation if that "information is reflected in [the] market price" of the stock at the time of the relevant transaction:<blockquote>Whether common questions of law or fact predominate in a securities fraud action often turns on the element of reliance. The courts below determined that EPJ Fund had to prove the separate element of loss causation in order to establish that reliance was capable of resolution on a common, classwide basis." [...] We recognized in Basic, however, that limiting proof of reliance in such a way "would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 10b-5 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market."</blockquote>The Court accordingly vacated the appeals court judgment and remanded the case for consistent proceedings.

<p>To invoke the <span class="casename">Basic</span> court's rebuttable presumption of reliance based on the "fraud-on-the-market" theory, plaintiffs must demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentations were publicly known, that the stock traded in an efficient market, and that the relevant transaction took place "between the time the misrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed." Loss causation is not one of the elements that triggers the rebuttable presumption. The form of the rule adopted by the Court ultimately lessens the burden on plaintiffs seeking securities fraud class certification.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges against Anwar allege that he sodomized a former male political aide. Anwar argued that Judge Zabidin Mohamad Diah had <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h2U8-Xnxji0wBiGhikG56iPnVKIA?docId=CNG.f7e01c9677bed553f378929ce2f3e8c7.461">convicted him</a> [AFP report] before he had a chance to give his defense. He pointed to the judge's ruling last month that he enter his defense because the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/malaysia-high-court-finds-sodomy-case-against-opposition-leader-anwar-to-continue.php">testimony of the aide was credible</a> [JURIST report] and the prosecution had met its <em>prima facie</em> case. Judge Zabidin dismissed the application for his removal. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. Anwar has consistently argued that the allegations are a politically motivated attempt to silence the opposition. This is the second sodomy case launched against Anwar who is expected to take the stand during his defense.

<p>Last month, the court ordered the trial to continue and that Anwar enter his defense. He was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit against his accuser</a> [JURIST reports] in late June. Last December, Anwar <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/malaysia-opposition-leader-files-complaint-over-wikileaks-sodomy-cable.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] in a Malaysian court over a <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. The leaked US diplomatic cable claimed Australia's <a href="http://www.ona.gov.au/">Office of National Assessments</a> [official website] had concluded, in agreement with Singapore's Intelligence Agency, that the sodomy charges against Anwar were the result of a set-up, but that he was in fact guilty of committing the acts. Last year, the <a href="http://www.kehakiman.gov.my/courts/maljudiciary.shtml">Federal Court of Malaysia</a> [official website], the country's highest court, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/malaysia-high-court-rejects-former-opposition-leaders-defamation-suit.php">rejected Anwar's 2006 defamation suit</a> against against former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2059518.stm">Mahathir Mohamad</a> [BBC profile] for allegedly suggesting at a human rights conference that Anwar was unfit for office because of his supposed homosexuality. Anwar was Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister under former Mahathir Mohamad until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a ten-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chiquita admitted to making payments to paramilitaries but argued it was a victim of extortion and was not responsible for any crimes, including torture and murder, committed by the paramilitaries. US District Judge Kenneth Marra denied in part the company's motion to dismiss the cases. Marra granted Chiquita's motion to dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute</a> (ATS) [28 USC &#167; 1350] and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/get_external.cgi?type=pubL&target=102-256">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991</a> (TVPA) [materials] claims for terrorism and material support to terrorist organizations; claims for cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; violation of the rights to life, liberty and security of person and peaceful assembly and association; and consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. The court denied Chiquita's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' ATS and TVPA claims for torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

<p>In February 2010, a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-allows-suit-against.php">federal judge ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a lawsuit accusing Chiquita of assisting Marxist rebels who killed Colombian missionaries may go forward. The suit was <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/judge-rules-families-can-proceed-with-suit-against-214454.html">brought</a> [Palm Beach Post report] by family members of five North American missionaries who had worked for the <a href="http://www.ntm.org/">New Tribes Mission</a> (NTM) [mission website] in South America and were killed in separate incidents between 1995 and 1996. Chiquita admitted it had paid AUC for protection of its workers but it argued that it did not condone the killings. In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/chiquita-to-pay-25m-to-settle-terrorism.php">Chiquita was fined $25 million</a> [JURIST report] after admitting to making payments of around $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to AUC.

Regents of the University of California</a> [docket], thereby rejecting a challenge to California's policy of granting in-state tuition for state colleges and universities to illegal immigrants who graduated from California high schools. Last year, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/05-19-Martinez-opinion-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/california-high-court-rules-illegal-immigrants-eligible-for-in-state-tuition.php">report</a>] that the state's policy did not conflict with federal law because a student's high school graduation, not his or her residency, formed the basis for granting in-state tuition. Most students who take advantage of this rule are <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/sc-dc-0607-court-tuition-20110607,0,1145039.story">enrolled in community colleges</a> [LAT report]. Also on Monday, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060611zor.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-772.htm">Hazleton v. Lozano</a> [docket], which challenged a <a href="http://coop.pamd.uscourts.gov/06v1586.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-pennsylvania.php">report</a>] that two anti-illegal immigration laws passed by the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania were unconstitutional. In light of the Supreme Court's recent decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-115.pdf">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">report</a>], the court ordered the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> to reexamine whether Hazleton can restrict illegal immigrants' ability to work and rent housing.

<p>The Supreme Court ruled last month in <span class="casename">Whiting</span> that an Arizona employment law imposing penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text]. The ruling opens the door for states to enact similar restraints on immigration. Several states have already <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed</a> [JURIST reports] tough immigration laws. In March, the <a href="http://www.oksenate.gov/">Oklahoma State Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would give police officers the authority to question the citizenship status of any person lawfully stopped for a traffic violation and arrest them without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally. Also in March, Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed</a> an immigration law requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor, but a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST reports] it less than 24 hours after it took effect. In February, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring suspected illegal immigrants to provide proof of their legal status and calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Brammertz also submitted a <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Reports%20and%20Publications/CompletionStrategy/completion_strategy_18may2011_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the Security Council which was critical of Serbia's efforts to capture Mladic and the other remaining ICTY fugitive Goran Hadzic. He said the arrest was a positive step but questions still remain as to Serbia's commitment to capturing the remaining fugitive: <blockquote> Serbia has met one of its key obligations towards the [ICTY] and simultaneously acknowledged the rule of law as a central building block for its future. While [Mladic's] arrest is an excellent result, the fact remains that he was at large for 16 years. This raises troubling questions about how it was possible for this individual to elude the substantial resources of a state system for so many years. We welcome the Serbian Government's statement that it will investigate and prosecute the networks that supported [Mladic] during his time in hiding. We also welcome the Government's expressed determination to expose and punish any state officials who assisted him. We ask the Serbian Government to follow through on these undertakings as a matter of priority.</blockquote> Brammertz said that Hadzic must be "apprehended without further delay" and called on Serbia to help the "public understand why [Mladic] has been arrested and why justice demands that he stand trial."

<p>Mladic <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">made his first appearance in the ICTY</a> [JURIST report] last week contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them. Characterized by many media outlets as "defiant," Mladic saluted several times through the proceedings, referred to himself as "General Mladic" and smiled at some survivors of the <a href = "/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">massacre of Srebrenica</a> [JURIST news archive] who had come to watch the proceedings. Serbian authorities <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] last month, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mladic <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost</a> his <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal</a> in Serbia to avoid <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">extradition</a>, and was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports] last week. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages. He is most infamous for ordering the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the massacre of Srebrenica during the <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The vote was at 18-18 until <a href="http://www.ct.gov/wyman/site/default.asp">Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman</a> [official website] broke the deadlock. The bill must now be passed by the <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/House.asp">Connecticut House of Representatives</a> [official website] to become law. Supporters of the bill contend that the bill is intended only to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2011/06/04/conn_bill_decriminalizes_small_amounts_of_pot/">"realign"</a> [AP report] the degree of punishment with the seriousness of the offense. Connecticut <a href="http://www.ct.gov/malloy/site/default.asp">Governor Dannel Malloy</a> [official website] agreed with vote calling it "common sense reforms." He <a href="http://www.governor.ct.gov/malloy/cwp/view.asp?Q=480530&A=4010">stated</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The punishment should fit the crime. Let's be clear &#8212; we are not making marijuana legal and we are not allowing people who use it and get caught to avoid the repercussions.  But we are acknowledging the reality that we are doing more harm than good when we prosecute people who are caught using marijuana &#8212; needlessly stigmatizing them in a way we would not if they were caught drinking underage, for example, and disproportionately affecting minorities.</blockquote>However, detractors of the bill say that the bill improperly lessens the severity of drug addiction. Under SB 1014 possession of less than a half ounce of marijuana would no longer be a misdemeanor and would instead result in a $150-500 fine depending upon the number of offenses. Additionally, individuals under the age of 21 could potentially have their driver's license suspended for 60 days. According to the <a href="http://norml.org/index.cfm">National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws</a> (NORML) [advocacy website], if the Connecticut legislature passes SB1014 it would <a href="http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=6331">join</a> [materials] Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Oregon as states that have decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Yet, under <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=gonzales+v.+raich&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=15647611274064109718&scilh=0">Gonzales v. Raich</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-sides-with.php">report</a>] the federal government may regulate marijuana use under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution even if individual states decriminalize its possession.

<p>The decriminalization of marijuana has been a contentious issue. Last week the <a href="http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/international-commission-recommends-legalizing-marijuana.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] calling for the international legalization of cannabis, marijuana and other drugs. The panel emphasized treatment and programs that discourage children from taking drugs, rather than relying on harsh punishments. The report stated that the <a href="http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf">UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961</a> [text, PDF] and the US's "War on Drugs" both have failed. Last month, Arizona <a href = "http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-file-lawsuit-over-controversial-state-medical-marijuana-law.php">federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a declaratory judgment over the legality under federal law of the State's <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-medical-marijuana-law.php">legalization of medical marijuana</a> [JURIST report] passed in November 2010. Medical marijuana is currently legal in 14 US states. In October 2009, US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] issued <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">guidelines for a new policy</a> [JURIST report] for investigating and prosecuting state-sanctioned medical marijuana use. Those guidelines reflect a pledge made by Holder in March to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/doj-to-end-raids-on-medical-marijuana.php">stop federal raids</a> [JURIST report] on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state laws. However, Holder has emphasized that if a state legalizes drugs for recreational use, <a href = "http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/16/local/la-me-marijuana-holder-20101016">federal law will be enforced</a> [<em>LAT</em> report], as California <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/western-voter-reject-propositions-to-expand-access-to-legalized-marijuana.php">attempted to legalize marijuana last year</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men facing charges in the ICC, the "Ocampo Six," are accused of inciting violence after the 2007 Kenyan elections which resulted in more than 1,100 deaths, 3,500 injuries, hundreds of rapes and up to 600,000 individuals being forcibly displaced.

<p>The Ocampo Six include several high-ranking members of Kenya's government, the head of operations at <a href="http://www.kassfm.co.ke/">Kass FM</a> [official website] in Nairobi and the son of Kenya's first president, <a href="http://www.africawithin.com/bios/jomo_kenyatta.htm">Jomo Kenyatta</a> [Africa Within backgrounder]. Three of the men are members of the <a href="http://www.odm.co.ke/">Orange Democratic Movement</a> (ODM) [party website], and the other three are members of the opposing Party for National Unity (PNU). The ODM suspects are charged with fomenting violence against PNU members following the 2007 elections because they believed the election of Kenyan <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] to be rigged. In response, the PNU suspects are charged with the conspiring with the <a href="http://www.saferaccess.org/documents/The%20Mungiki%20-%20Cult%20Street%20Gang%20or%20Political%20Force.pdf">Mungiki criminal organization</a> [Safer Access backgrounder, PDF] to attack members of the ODM party.

In April, Kenya <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kenya-urges-icc-to-drop-post-election-volence-cases.php">requested that the ICC dismiss the case</a> [JURIST report], arguing that the government is capable of prosecuting the six men domestically.

The suit revolves around a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">2007 shooting incident</a> [JURIST report] in the Nisour Square area of Baghdad that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead. A subsequent <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] investigation revealed that 14 of the deaths were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/world/middleeast/14blackwater.html?_r=1">unjustified acts of excessive force</a> [NYT report]. The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] initially <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/memorandum-of-dismissal-of-charges-against-blackwater-guards/original.pdf">dismissed the charges</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">report</a>] because it found the decision to prosecute the men was "tainted" by the use of immunized statements. In April, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/A311ECA37BE9E9AE8525787A004E0A0B/$file/10-3006-1304592.pdf">reinstated</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-case-against-blackwater-guards.php">report</a>] the case against the guards. The attorneys argued in their petition that the appeals court failed to properly apply the legal standards in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/406/441/case.html">Kastigar v. United States</a> [opinion]: <blockquote>Kastigar imposes a "total prohibition" on "any use" of defendants' compelled statements "in any respect" to "inflict[] criminal penalties" on them. It certainly advances the "infliction of criminal penalties" when a prosecutor uses a defendant's compelled statement to decide to indict the defendant, and to obtain authorization from DOJ to seek the indictment, as happened here. A defendant who is indicted as a result of his compelled statements is hardly in the same position as if he had stood on his privilege.</blockquote>The lawsuit, the last remaining in relation to the shooting incident, was filed by the families of six victims.

<p>Two ex-Blackwater contractors were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-blackwater-contractors-convicted-of-manslaughter-for-afghan-shootings----dnp.php">convicted of manslaughter</a> [JURIST report] in March for their role in the May 2009 shooting deaths of two Afghan nationals and the wounding of a third. Last April, a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-blackwater-executives-indicted.php">indicted five former Blackwater executives</a> [JURIST report] on charges of weapons violations and lying to investigators. In February 2010, the Iraqi government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">ordered 250 former Blackwater employees to leave Iraq</a> [JURIST report] in reaction to the dismissal of charges against the ex-Blackwater employees allegedly involved in the September 2007 shootings. That month, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/blackwater-under-investigation-for.php">opened an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether Blackwater bribed the Iraqi government to be permitted to continue operating in Iraq following the 2007 shootings. Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">ceased operations in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 when its security contracts expired and were not renewed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://wyomcases.courts.state.wy.us/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=462423">ruled</a> [opinion] Monday that a same-sex couple married in Canada can get a divorce in Wyoming. The couple was legally married in Canada in 2008 and began divorce proceedings in Wyoming, where the couple resides. A district court determined it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate an action to dissolve a <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] because Wyoming state statute defines marriage as "a civil contract between a male and a female person." The Wyoming high court overruled the district court's decision. Because state statute also indicates that "[a]ll marriage contracts which are valid by the laws of the country in which contracted are valid in this state," the court reasoned that it had subject-matter jurisdiction over the proceeding. In reaching its conclusion, the court distinguished between same-sex marriage and same-sex divorce:<blockquote>[R]ecognizing a valid foreign same-sex marriage for the limited purpose of entertaining a divorce proceeding does not lessen the law or policy in Wyoming against allowing the creation of same-sex marriages. A divorce proceeding does not involve recognition of a marriage as an ongoing relationship. Indeed, accepting that a valid marriage exists plays no role except as a condition precedent to granting a divorce. After the condition precedent is met, the laws regarding divorce apply. Laws regarding marriage play no role.</blockquote>The court reversed and remanded the decision for further consistent proceedings at the district court level.

<p>A number of states diverge on the issue of whether to recognize of out-of-state same-sex marriages. In April, Washington <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/">Governor Chris Gregoire</a> [official website] signed a <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?bill=1649">bill</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/washington-governor-signs-bill-recognizing-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.php">report</a>] recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages as legal domestic partnerships. In January, the <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/lsoweb/">Wyoming House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://legisweb.state.wy.us/2011/Bills/HB0074.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/wyoming-legislature-approves-bill-rejecting-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">prevent Wyoming from recognizing</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriages and civil unions performed out-of-state. Earlier that month, New Mexico <a href="http://www.nmag.gov/">Attorney General Gary King</a> [official website] issued an opinion stating that gay marriages from out of state would <a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/68490/king-says-new-mexico-can-recognize-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages">likely be legal</a> [<em>New Mexico Independent</em> report] there. Last year, Maryland <a href="http://www.oag.state.md.us/">Attorney General Douglas Gansler</a> [official website] declared that the state <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/maryland-should-recognize-out-of-state.php">should recognize</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington, DC</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

He will replace Kagan who was the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/harvard-law-dean-kagan-becomes-first.php">first woman</a> [JURIST report] to serve as Solicitor General before moving on to the Supreme Court.

Haarde <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/07/iceland-trial-idUSLDE75621820110607">vowed that he would prove his innocence</a> [Reuters report] and claimed that the charges were a result of the first political trial in the nation's history. Haarde is facing trial in the Landsdomur, a special court created to try government ministers, after being accused of <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/138/s/1538.html">intentionally or grossly negligently failing to prevent the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis</a> [resolution, in Icelandic]. The <a href="http://sic.althingi.is/">Special Investigation Committee</a> (SIC) [official website, in Icelandic], convened in 2008 by Parliament to investigate the collapse of the country's three largest banks, determined that Haarde and former central bank head <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/thingm/1701487469.html?knt=1701487469">David Oddsson</a> [official profile, in Icelandic] knew that banks were assuming overseas debt but took no action to prevent or mitigate the effects of the accumulation.

<p>Last September, the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website, in Icelandic] referred charges to the Landsdomur after the SIC released a report claiming that seven Icelandic government officials acted with gross negligence in their management of the country's financial system prior to a 2008 bank collapse. The SIC also found that former minister of finance Arni Mathiessen, then-banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson, former <a href="http://www.fme.is/?PageID=146">Financial Services Authority</a> [official website] director Jonas Jonsson and central bank officials Eirikur Gundason and Ingimundur Fridriksson failed to take appropriate action when presented with information about the poor state of the country's financial sector.

The ICC prosecutor's office indicated it <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43310027/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa">could not investigate the killings</a> [Reuters report] because it can prosecute only those crimes committed by nationals of ICC member states. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] also <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/un-urged-act-following-deadliest-weekend-yet-syria-2011-06-06">called</a> [press release] on the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to refer the Syria killings to the ICC. AI's Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Philip Luther, expressed his dissatisfaction with the UN Security Council:<blockquote>As the death toll in Syria reaches staggering new heights, it is imperative that the UN Security Council&#8212;which has so far been silent on this issue&#8212;votes to condemn the killings. ... It must also take decisive action and refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Those responsible for the brutal crackdown of pro-reform protesters must no longer be allowed to get away with murder.</blockquote>Unless the UN Security Council refers the matter to the court, the ICC does not have jurisdiction in Syria because Damascus is not a party to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/EA9AEFF7-5752-4F84-BE94-0A655EB30E16/0/Rome_Statute_English.pdf">2002 Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] that established the court.

<p>There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], in an emergency special session in April, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4dbfe77d2.pdf">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">report</a>] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">called for Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also in April, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued. Earlier in the same month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">stopped medical personnel</a> [JURIST report], sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] in March to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence. As demonstrations continued throughout the country in March, the government <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/1119018/1/.html">freed 260 political detainees</a> [AFP report] in an overture to the protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay reported that between 30 and 40 protesters had been killed by Israeli security forces along the ceasefire line between the occupied borders. Nearly <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/israeli-forces-kill-18-protesters-syrian-tv-043810558.html">20 civilian protesters were reportedly killed</a> [Reuters report] during a protest on June 5 marking the anniversary of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html">1967 Middle East war</a> [NPR backgrounder]. Pillay also communicated her concern regarding allegations that Syrian officials encouraged the protesters to tread on dangerous landmine-peppered terrain. Finally, Pillay urged authorities to begin conducting investigations into civilian <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1643608.php/Five-reported-killed-in-Israeli-Syrian-border-clashes">deaths at a May 15 protest</a> [DPA report] where protesters were killed when Israeli soldiers opened fired on Palestinian and Syrian civilians along the Golan Heights border.

<p>Israel has faced ongoing criticism from the UN and international human rights groups for its action in the Palestinian territories, which have been under Israeli military control since 1967. In January, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-official-expresses-concern-over-violence-against-palestinians.php">UN official alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Israeli authorities had <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10633&LangID=E">committed several illegal acts</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/oPt.html">Palestinian territories</a> [UNICEF backgrounder] since the start of the year, making the prospect of a viable Palestinian state unlikely. In June 2010, Israeli human rights group <a href="http://www.btselem.org/">B'Tselem</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/palestinian-rights-advance-in-2009-but-need-improvement-report.php">released its annual report</a> [JURIST report], noting an advancement in the rights of Palestinians, but calling for greater improvement. The report found that fatalities had declined by 80 percent compared to the previous year, and the quality of life had improved in the West Bank. The report called on Israel to dismantle all settlements, saying that merely halting new settlements is insufficient. The rights organization also chided Israeli security forces for not adequately protecting Palestinians from violence at the hands of Israelis, criticizing a "history of leniency" against the perpetrators of that violence. In March 2010, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-illegal-west.php">called Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank "illegal"</a> [JURIST report], and supported a plan by Palestinian Authority <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6757273.stm">Prime Minister Salam Fayyad</a> [BBC profile] to build the institutions of an independent state by 2011. </p>]]></content:encoded>

An Egyptian elections commission <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCEygWYA5F5x5-doVCgIyyBlyb8w?docId=CNG.4089686353aadee570c27cb1d4593484.951">approved</a> [AFP report] the formation of the MB's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP). The MB announced the FJP on April 30, which is set to challenge for half the parliament seats in the upcoming September elections. The MB was founded in 1928 and was officially banned in Egypt in 1954. But under former president <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>], the organization was mostly tolerated. MB chairman Dr. Mohamed Badie <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=28685">expressed his pleasure</a> [press release] with the acceptance of the FJP and called on it to advocate for a civil state that promote Islamic values. A Gallup poll released Sunday suggests that only a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110605/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_egypt_poll">small minority of Egyptians support the MB</a> [AP report] and less than one percent are in favor of an Iran-style Islamic theocracy. However, the poll showed that 69 percent were in favor of religious leaders having an "advisory role."

<p>The MB first announced in February that it would <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-egypt-constitution-20110216,0,5662653.story">form a party</a> [LAT report] to participate in upcoming elections. In years past, numerous MB members attempting to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/egypt-police-arrest-51-muslim.php">run for office</a> in Egypt were <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/egypt-police-arrest-70-more-muslim.php">arrested</a> [JURIST reports]. The MB is gaining full recognition as a result of the uprisings across the Middle East that began earlier this year. Last week, Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] granted amnesty to political prisoners including all members of the previously banned MB, in a move seen as an attempt by Assad to defuse the 10-week uprising in Syria to overthrow the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay called for independent, transparent investigations into human rights violations that allegedly took place during the demonstrations.

<p>Bahrain, along with several other Middle Eastern and North African nations, has faced criticism from international human rights organizations for its handling of pro-reform protests in recent months. In May, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said the government of Bahrain should suspend prosecution of civilians in military courts and set up an <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/05/10/bahrain-activist-bears-signs-abuse">impartial commission to investigate torture allegations</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">report</a>]. Also in May, Pillay urged the government of Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-bahrain-to-free-detained-protesters.php">release detained activists</a> [JURIST report] and exercise restraint against protesters. She expressed concern over the prosecution of medical professionals and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">death sentences</a> [JURIST report] handed to four activists last month. In April, human rights organizations including HRW and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized Bahrain</a> [JURIST report] for human rights abuses related to anti-government protests.

The plan is a response to the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1233">Brown v. Plata</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-california-prison-population-reduction-order.php">report</a>] to uphold a federal three-judge panel order that California reduce its state prison population to within 137.5 percent of institutional design capacity. The submitted plan outlines measures that the state was taking to reduce prison populations including the passage of <a href="http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/billtrack/text.html?bvid=20110AB10995CHP">AB 109</a> [text], which once funded by the legislature, will transfer adult prisoners to local jails. Brown did not ask for an extension, though he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/california-governor-jerry-brown-on.php">indicated</a> [JURIST report] that he would ask a federal judge for more time. Brown did, however, express some reservations about the state's ability to meet the deadlines imposed, noting that the legislature has yet to pass the AB 109 funding bill and that "until AB 109 is funded and implemented and all necessary construction projects are approved, it is too soon to know precisely how fast and at what rate crowding will be reduced." <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/index.html">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> (CDCR) [official website] Secretary Matthew Cate also <a href="http://cdcrtoday.blogspot.com/2011/06/state-responds-to-three-judge-courts.html">stressed the importance</a> [press release] of funding AB 109:<blockquote>Our current reduction plan does not include the early release of inmates. But it is absolutely critical that the Legislature understand the seriousness of the Supreme Court's decision and support a variety of measures that will allow us to lower our inmate population in the safest possible way. AB 109 is the cornerstone of the solution, and the Legislature must act to protect public safety by funding Realignment.</blockquote>The plan also said <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sbx3_18_bill_20091011_chaptered.html">SB 18</a> [text] "will substantially reduce prison crowding." The bill, which is already being implemented, is meant to reduce crowding by restructuring the parole system, providing inmates with more opportunities to earn early release credits, creating an alternative rehabilitative program for parole violators rather than being sent back to prison, and changing the law to increase the threshold for felonies in crimes that could be a misdemeanor depending on the amount stolen. The number of inmates currently in California prisons is approximately 143,500, about a 19,000 inmate reduction from 2006 when the plaintiffs filed their motions to convene the three-judge panel. 

<p><object style="height: 390px; width: 640px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/rrx31oA4WZ8?version=3"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/rrx31oA4WZ8?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="640" height="390"></object></p>

<p>The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, upheld the three-judge panel order, concluding that the extreme overcrowding of the California prison system violated the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendment</a> [text] because it prevented the system from providing adequate medical and mental health care to the inmates. The Court said the inability to provide this "basic sustenance" was a constitutional violation that the courts must remedy. The California prison system was operating at nearly 200 percent capacity. The three-judge panel ordered California to reduce the population by 46,000 inmates to be under 137.5 percent institutional capacity within two years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Khodorkovsky has served half of a 13-year sentence for fraud, theft and money laundering, which under Russian law makes him eligible for parole. Once CEO of <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">Yukos Oil</a> [JURIST news archive] and one of the richest men in Russia, Khodorkovsky and his business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Platon+Lebedev">news archive</a>], who is serving time for similar charges, filed parole requests, but a Russian court Monday <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE75618B20110607?sp=true">refused to consider the requests</a> [Reuters report] because they were not properly supplemented with documents showing the men are actually serving their sentences, which are scheduled to run until 2016. Khodorkovsky has denied all the charges and maintains that he was falsely convicted as retribution for funding opposition parties during the presidency of now <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website]. Yukos was split up and Russian state-controlled oil firm Rosneft eventually bought the largest production assets, making Rosneft the country's biggest oil producer.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ruled that Khodorkovsky did not prove his prosecution and detention for tax evasion and fraud were politically motivated but found that his detention violated human rights standards. Last month, a Moscow court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/russia-appeals-court-upholds-khodorkovsky-conviction-reduces-sentence.php">upheld a second set of fraud convictions</a> [JURIST report] against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev but reduced their sentences by one year. The two men, already serving sentences handed down in 2005 for <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-khodorkovsky-sentenced.php">fraud and tax evasion</a>, were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December of embezzling from their company, Yukos Oil, and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to an additional eight years. They <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/khodorkovsky-files-appeal-seeks-probe-against-judge.php">appealed</a>, alleging, among other things, that Judge Viktor Danilkin did <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/khodorkovsky-verdict-product-of-coercion-judges-assistant.php">not write the verdict</a> [JURIST reports] and that he was coerced into reading it. Khodorkovsky vehemently <a href="http://khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/appeal-denied-khodorkovsky-slams-courts-destruction-law-treason-against-peopl">criticized</a> [press release] the ruling as flying in the face of the rule of law. The two men can now expect to be released in 2016 instead of 2017. The December verdict drew harsh <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution." The <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main">Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs</a> [official website, in Russian] dismissed critics, <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/0/ECD8813967CD249EC32578070037C1D6">saying</a> [press release, in Russian] that "[a]ttempts to exert pressure on the court are unacceptable."</p>]]></content:encoded>

On Friday, District Judge James Cacheris held a hearing during which US prosecutors said they <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-03/u-s-asks-federal-judge-to-reinstate-corporate-campaign-donation-charges.html">failed to cite key precedent</a> [Bloomberg report] related to campaign finance, and that Cacheris did not have enough information to rule that the ban on direct corporate financing was unconstitutional. In May, Cacheris dismissed a criminal count against two men charged with illegally <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/va-judge-rules-against-us-ban-on-direct-corporate-contributions-to-candidates/2011/05/27/AGEPEpCH_story.html">reimbursing individuals for almost $200,000 in contributions</a> [WP report] to Hillary Clinton's 2006 senate and 2008 presidential primary campaign. In dismissing the count, Cacheris stated that the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html">Citizens United</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>] had dissolved the legal underpinnings for the federal ban against direct contributions from corporations to a candidate. The US attorneys asked Cacheris to consider <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-403.ZS.html">Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont</a> [opinion], where the Supreme Court specifically upheld a ban on corporate contributions to election campaigns. In his opinion, Cacheris said <span class="casename">Beaumont</span> applies only to nonprofit advocacy corporations and that <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> supersedes <span class="casename">Beaumont</span>.

<p>Campaign finance regulation has been in a state of flux since <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> was decided in January of last year. In May, the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/11/05/103126P.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-minnesota-campaign-finance-law.php">report</a>] a Minnesota campaign financing law prohibiting direct contributions to candidates and affiliated entities. A judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] in April <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-upholds-wisconsin-supreme-court-campaign-finance-law.php">dismissed two challenges</a> [JURIST report] to campaign financing schemes for Wisconsin Supreme Court elections. Last March, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in two consolidated campaign finance cases. In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-238.pdf">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] forbids states from providing publicly financed candidates with additional government subsidies, which are triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates or by the candidates' privately financed opponents. In <span class="casename">McComish v. Bennett</span>, the court will determine whether Arizona's matching funds law and a law regulating campaign financing to equalize resources among candidates and interest groups, rather than advancing a compelling state interest in the least restrictive manner, violate the First and <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Both <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/node/99495">reports alleged</a> [HRW press release] that investigations have been conducted through torture, and that typically, only confessions given through torture have been recognized as evidence while other, legitimate evidence has been ignored. Further, court officials have not acknowledged physical attacks on defendants and their lawyers. HRW recommended various reforms, including: the state committing to impartial and thorough investigations, both of torture during criminal proceedings and the violence from last year; asking the international community for aid in the investigations and trials; incorporating international human rights law into legislation; and submitting to a visit from the UN special rapporteur on torture. Both groups warned that Kyrgyzstan could face a resurgence of violence if these reforms are not made.

In response to the KIC report, the Kyrgyz government <a href = "http://www.k-ic.org/images/stories/kg_comments_english_final.pdf">admitted</a> [reply, PDF] that there have been problems with the judicial system and they have made steps toward improving the process.

<p>Earlier this year, the US <A href = "http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] also <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">criticized Kyrgyzstan</a> [JURIST report] in its <a href = "http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials], stating <A href = "http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154482.htm">Kyrgyzstan</a> [materials] still faced significant rights issues and ethnic violence despite the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/kyrgyzstan-opposition-declares-interim.php">overthrow of an authoritarian government</a> and the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/kyrgyzstan-constitution-takes-effect-after-referendum-results-confirmed.php">passage of a new constitution</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontphilippines.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A Philippine court on Tuesday froze USD $23 million worth of assets owned by the Ampatuan family, who are accused of ordering the killing of 57 people. The <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/index.php?id1=1">Philippines Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] had implicated Andal Ampatuan Sr., the leader of a Muslim clan in the Philippines' semi-autonomous southern province of Maguindanao, and several of his followers in the November 2009 <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/index.php?rt=&amp;tsq1=49">slayings</a> [press release] of campaign workers, journalists and supporters of family political rival Esmael Mangudadatu. The Philippine <a href="http://ca.judiciary.gov.ph/">Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13692560">ordered</a> [BBC report] that Ampatuan family bank account funds, businesses and property be frozen while investigators determine how the Ampatuans accumulated the assets. The <a href="http://www.amlc.gov.ph/">Anti-Money Laundering Council</a> [official website] now has 20 days to gather evidence suggesting that some of the assets were accrued illegally. Prosecutors were pleased with the decision but expressed discontent that the court waited over a year to freeze the assets.

<p>In March, a Quezon City court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-clan-leader-cleared-of.php">dismissed rebellion charges</a> [JURIST report] against 24 people, including Ampatuan Sr. Days earlier, a court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-189.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for 189 suspects. The PDOJ had already <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-prosecutors-charge-197-for.php">charged 197 people with murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the November 2009 killings. In December 2009, the PDOJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-prosecutors-begin-rebellion.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of more than 600 people charged with rebellion for allegedly interfering with government operations following the killings. Several of Amapuan Sr.'s sons, including Andal Ampatuan Jr., the mayor of the southern Philippine town of Datu Unsay, have also been charged. Amapuan Jr. has <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/philippines-mayor-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 41 counts of murder. The Ampatuans and several of their followers are alleged to have intercepted Mangudadatu's convoy en route to declare his candidacy for governor at a regional election office, ultimately forcing his convoy to a remote hilltop where the Ampatuans' group killed and buried them. Following the killings, former Philippine President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-president-makes-first.php">imposed martial law</a> [JURIST report] and suspended <font style="font-style: italic;">habeas corpus</font> in Maguindanao.

The ACLU filed the appeal in the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] arguing that he has a valid <span class="casename">Bivens</span> action against the government officials responsible for his alleged unlawful detention, including former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Padilla's lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-padilla-torture-suit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] by a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] last February who ruled that the government officials had qualified immunity because they did not violate any "clearly established" law and that "special factors" precluded a <span class="casename">Bivens</span> action. Padilla, a US citizen, was arrested in 2002 and detained as an <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">"enemy combatant"</a> [JURIST news archive] before eventually being transferred to civilian authority. He claims that his detention as an enemy combatant was unlawful and that he was subjected to torture, denied communication with his family or lawyers, denied ability to practice his religion, and denied appropriate medical care. His appeal argues that in holding the <span class="casename">Bivens</span> action was not valid that "the district court effectively held that Defendants were above the law and Plaintiffs were beneath it." The appeal further argues that there is clear evidence to support a Bivens action and that the "special factors" cited by the District Court are unprecedented. Ben Wizner of the ACLU National Security Project in <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-appeals-dismissal-lawsuit-seeking-hold-government-officials-accountable-0">announcing</a> [press release] the appeal said: <blockquote>The defendants in this case seized Jose Padilla from a civilian jail and hid him away in a military brig precisely to keep the courts from interfering with the terrible things they were doing to him. By granting the defendants legal immunity for their cruel acts, the district court vindicated their deliberate efforts to circumvent the Constitution. If the law does not protect Jose Padilla&#8212;an American citizen arrested on American soil and tortured in an American prison&#8212;it protects no one.</blockquote>Some of the other government officials named as defendants in their official capacity include former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and current Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. 

<p>Though Padilla's lawsuit against Rumsfeld and the others was dismissed by a South Carolina judge, a federal judge in San Francisco reached the opposite conclusion in June 2009 when he <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss.php">allowed</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-sues-law-professor-who-helped.php">lawsuit filed</a> [JURIST reports] by Padilla to move forward against University of California Berkeley <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=235">law professor John Yoo</a> [academic profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=john+yoo">news archive</a>], the author of controversial US government memos arguing that detained enemy combatants could be denied Geneva Conventions protections against torture. The suit alleges that Yoo's memos, written while he was a senior lawyer in the US Justice Department, helped set the Bush administration's policy that terrorism detainees are not protected by the Geneva Conventions. Padilla was convicted and sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-gets-17-year-prison-sentence-on.php">17 years in prison</a> [JURIST report], along with Adham Amin Hassoun and Kifadh Wael Jayyousi, on charges of conspiracy to commit illegal violent acts outside the US, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and providing material support to terrorists. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Two indictees include former leaders of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), Ibrahim Bazzy Kamara and Santigie Borbor Kanu, who were both <a href = "/paperchase/2007/06/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-hands.php">convicted</a> by the SCSL in June 2007, and <a href = "/paperchase/2007/07/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-sentences.php">sentenced to at least 45 years in prison</a> [JURIST reports]. Their accomplices, Hassan Papa Bangura and Samuel Kargbo, live in Sierra Leone and allegedly helped them attempt to bribe witnesses to recant their testimony. Kamara is also charged with releasing a protected witness' name. A fifth suspect, Eric Senessie, is charged with attempting to force witnesses who testified against <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2963086.stm">Charles Taylor</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/currentawareness/taylor.php">news archive</a>] to recant their testimony.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthealthcare.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] heard oral arguments Wednesday over the constitutionality of the new <a href="/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">health care reform law</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>] and its individual mandate requiring citizens to purchase health insurance. The <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] appealed the decision of the <a href = "http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">individual mandate exceeds</a> [JURIST report] Congress' authority under the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and thus, the entire <A href = "/gazette/2010/03/health-care-reform-bill-us-house.php">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [HR 3590; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=health+care">news archive</a>] is unconstitutional. Former solicitor general Paul Clement, representing Florida and 26 other states backing the lawsuit, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/08/us-usa-healthcare-idUSTRE7570UI20110608">argued to the court</a> [Reuters report] that Congress has never before used the Commerce Clause power to force citizens to purchase something. The DOJ argued that the choice not to purchase insurance affects everyone. In the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/doj-files-brief-in-florida-health-care-appeal.php">DOJ brief</a> [JURIST report] it said: "Congress did not exceed its commerce power by opting to require minimum insurance coverage or the payment of a tax, instead of conditioning access to health care on the purchase of insurance and thereby denying the sick and injured access to medical care if they do not have coverage." Another issue in this case is, even if the individual mandate is found to be unconstitutional, whether that necessarily means the entire PPACA is unconstitutional. District Judge Roger Vinson found that the individual mandate was inseverable from the rest of the health care law. Last February, the DOJ asked Vinson to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-asks-federal-judge-to-clarify-health-care-ruling.php">clarify that states must continue to enact the health care reform law</a> [JURIST report] as the government appeals the ruling.

<p>The PPACA has sparked several lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Last week, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-hears-challenge-to-health-care-law-individual-mandate.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a similar challenge to the constitutionality of the individual mandate brought by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?682648548">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website]. But in that case the court of appeals asked the parties to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/sixth-circuit-asks-health-care-challengers-to-explain-why-they-can-sue.php">address to standing concerns</a> [JURIST report] of whether there is an injury in fact and whether review is precluded until after implementation of the law. The appeal stems from a ruling <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">upholding</a> [JURIST report] the PPACA and its individual mandate. Also last week, the <a href = "http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decided it c<a href="/paperchase/2011/06/fourth-circuit-finds-it-can-rule-on-health-care-law-challenge.php">an rule on two challenges</a> to the PPACA after the court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/fourth-circuit-questions-authority-to-hear-health-care-law-challenge.php">requested briefs</a> from all parties on whether the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> (AIA) [text], which prevents injunctions against taxes before the tax is imposed, would bar review of PPACA until it is implemented. The Fourth Circuit had already <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] last month to resolve a split decision between the US district courts for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against individual mandate provision</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, the <a href="http://www.aclj.org/Default.aspx">American Center for Law and Justice</a> (ACLJ) [advocacy website] sought to have its <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclj-appeals-dismissal-of-health-care-reform-lawsuit.php">challenge reinstated</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] after it was dismissed by the lower court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Ocampo's statement, al-Bashir continues to commit genocide, halt dissemination of information about displaced victims, and threaten the international community with retaliation. Ocampo called for cooperation from the international community:<blockquote>The mandate of the International Criminal Court is to end impunity to prevent future crimes. We share this mission with the UN Security Council, the African Union and the Government of the Sudan. The efficacy of our common efforts will depend greatly on how we share information with each other and learn from it. The Prosecution is trying to improve its practice in this area, linking the information collected with the current behavior of the suspects.</blockquote>Ocampo also <a href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1644328.php/ICC-Sudan-leader-al-Bashir-continues-crimes-in-Darfur">asked</a> [DPA report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], with the assistance of <a href="http://www.denhaag.nl/en.htm">The Hague</a> [official website], to use information gathered by the ICC to "stop the crimes in Darfur." Ocampo also said that two Sudanese military commanders who had already surrendered to charges demanded that al-Bashir appear at The Hague before ICC judges. Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain (Banda) and Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus (Jerbo) <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/sudan-war-crimes-suspects-agree-not-to-contest-icc-charges.php">filed a joint motion</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/">ICC Prosecutors Office</a> [official website] in October agreeing to the facts laid out in the prosecution's description of charges.

<p>Several countries have been reported for failing to arrest al-Bashir while he has been present inside their borders. In May, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">urged Djibouti</a> [JURIST report] to arrest al-Bashir. In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">ICC requested that  Kenya arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] while he visited that year for a second time. Previously, al-Bashir had visited Kenya for the signing of the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Following his visit, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc930979.pdf">reported Kenya</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">report</a>] to the UN Security Council and the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute for the violation in not arresting al-Bashir. Also following his August visit, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Kenya to reaffirm its cooperation with the ICC by <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/annan-questions-kenyas-icc-commitment-after-al-bashir-visit.php">arresting al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. In July, the ICC called for <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-al-bashir-will-be-arrested.php">al-Bashir's arrest</a> [JURIST report] during his visit to Chad, marking the first visit to an ICC member state since the warrants were issued.

In April, Chinese authorities took the monks from the Kirti monastery in buses to an unknown location. In the process, they are accused of "violently" removing a human shield of local elderly women attempting to protect the monastery. Two villagers died in the removal, but the cause was not reported. Since then, the monastery has been "boarded up" and presumably abandoned. Although the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has reports that some of the monks have been released, they requested details on all of the monks, as well as all others in China's history of "enforced disappearances." They also recalled China's promise to ratify two international treaties related to disappearing persons: the <A href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text] and the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disappearance-convention.htm">International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance</a> [text]. In March, the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances also called on the Chinese government to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/un-panel-urges-china-to-release-detained-human-rights-lawyer.php">free detained human rights lawyer</a> [JURIST report] <a href = "http://www.freegao.com/">Gao Zhisheng</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Zhisheng">news archive</a>], whom they claim is being held in violation of international law. China has not commented on either matter.

<p>China's human rights record has been widely criticized. Earlier this month, the US <A href = "http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">urged the Chinese government to release protesters</a> [JURIST report] arrested during peaceful protests in <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder] in June 1989. Last year detained Chinese human rights activist <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+Xiaobo">news archive</a>] was <a href = "/paperchase/2010/10/china-dissident-liu-xiaobo-wins-2010-nobel-peace-prize.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] as the winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. The Chinese government denounced the decision, calling it "contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Prize." In February 2010, a Chinese appeals court <a href = "/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Liu's 11-year prison sentence despite calls for his release from US and EU officials.

In June 2009, rights groups marked the twentieth anniversary of the 1989 uprising in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, calling for the government to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/06/rights-advocates-urge-reform-on-20th.php">investigate the incident</a> [JURIST report] and implement changes called for by Charter 08.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/">Sierra Club</a> and <a href="http://www.environmenttexas.org/">Environment Texas</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/08/us-exxon-lawsuit-baytown-idUSTRE7574ZI20110608">filed the lawsuit</a> [Reuters report] in December in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/notablecases/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] against ExxonMobil's Baytown, Texas, refinery and the adjacent chemical plant for allegedly releasing over 8 million pounds of pollutants beyond the levels permitted under the CAA in the last five years. The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> (CAA) [materials] contains a provision permitting private individuals to seek enforcement of federal pollution laws when the US <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] fails to do so. Exxon argued that the lawsuit should not proceed because the EPA already oversees the enforcement of CAA pollution standards. The parties <a href="http://www.environmenttexas.org/newsroom/clean-air-news/clean-air-news/exxon-loses-bid-to-halt-clean-air-act-suit">seek a court order</a> [press release] enjoining ExxonMobil to cease committing CAA violations. ExxonMobil also faces civil penalties of up to $37,500 per day for each violation.

<p>Former New York attorney general <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] announced in August 2008 that 12 states had <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/media_center/2008/may/may28e_08.html">filed suit</a> [press release] against the EPA for its alleged failure to enforce provisions of the CAA requiring oil refineries to adopt measures curbing the pollution contributing to global warming. The lawsuit was an attempt by New York and several other states to force the EPA to comply with CAA terms requiring global warming pollution regulation. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200808/04-1243-1133914.pdf">vacated</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/dc-circuit-strikes-down-epa-ban-on.php">report</a>] a 2006 EPA <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/pdf/E6-21335.pdf">rule</a> [Federal Register notice] prohibiting state and local governments from monitoring air pollution below acceptable levels set by the EPA for "stationary" sources such as power plants and factories.  Earlier in 2008, 14 states <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/environmental-groups-states-sue-epa.php">sued the EPA over new smog regulations</a> [JURIST report].  In 2006, a group of states <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/states-sue-epa-for-alleged-clean-air.php">sued the EPA</a> [JURIST report] over its alleged failure to regulate smog emissions from power plants. The EPA and the US Justice Department <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/exxonmobil-settles-clean-air-act.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in October 2005 that ExxonMobil would spend an estimated $571 million to settle a lawsuit with the federal government and three states over alleged violations of the CAA. The settlement was intended to cut the annual production of pollutants from ExxonMobil's refineries that cause respiratory problems and worsen childhood asthma, and must be spent cutting the production of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontreporters.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/supreme/A710TooMuchMediavHale.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unaimously Tuesday that a blogger does not have the same privilege to protect her sources as other journalists in traditional media. The court found that a New Jersey <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/privilege/item.php?t=short&state=NJ&level=2A">"shield law"</a> [NJSA 2A:84A-21&#8211;21.8] allowing reporters to protect the confidentiality of their sources could not be invoked by a blogger who posted comments on an Internet message board. Shellee Hale founded a website called Pornafia.com in which she intended to reveal alleged illegal activity of the Internet pornography industry. The website did not get off the ground but instead she decided to post comments on Oprano.com, a message board for the pornography industry. She posted multiple entries accusing the plaintiff <a href="https://www.toomuchmedia.com/index.htm?tmmatt=1">Too Much Media</a> (TMM) [corporate website], which provides a service for adult entertainment sites to keep track of affiliated sites for commission purposes, of data breaches revealing anonymous user count information. Hale claims to have learned this through confidential sources, including one source who was threatened by TMM. She also claims that to make her posts she interviewed government officials, attended industry trade shows and collected information from other Internet blogs. TMM filed a defamation suit against Hale and during discovery tried to learn the names of her confidential sources. Hale tried to invoke the shield law to protect her sources' identities. The court, however, found that Hale's protection of her confidential sources was not protected by the First Amendment and did not fall within New Jersey's shield law. The court said since the message boards were different from traditional journalism reporting the shield law could not apply:<blockquote>Those forums allow people a chance to express their thoughts about matters of interest. But they are not the functional equivalent of the types of news media outlets outlined in the Shield Law. Neither writing a letter to the editor nor posting a comment on an online message board establishes the connection with "news media" required by the statute. Therefore, even under the most liberal interpretation of the statute, defendant's use of a message board to post her comments is not covered under the Shield Law. We do not believe that the Legislature intended to provide everyone who posts a comment on Oprano or a response to an article on NJ.com an absolute reporter's privilege under the Shield Law.</blockquote> Hale was support by amici from freedom of the press and civil rights organizations including the <a href="http://aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website], which argued that the privilege depends on the individual's intent to gather and disseminate news, and read the New Jersey shield law statute to provide protection for either someone employed in the news media or someone connected with the gathering of news. 

<p>Protection for <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=journalist+protection">journalists</a> [JURIST news archive] and their sources continues to be a worldwide concern. In October, the <a href = "http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] expanded journalists' rights to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/canada-supreme-court-broadens-journalists-rights-to-protect-sources.php">protect sources</a> [JURIST report] while testifying. In April 2010, Germany announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/germany-justice-minister-calls-for.php">enact legislation</a> [JURIST report] meant to increase freedom of the press. Also in 2010, the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/vefur/uppla.html">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website, in Icelandic] began <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iceland-parliament-considering-new.php">considering measures</a> [JURIST report] aimed at increasing protections for journalists and promoting freedom of speech and transparency in government. In December 2009, the US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/senate-judiciary-committe-approves.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would protect journalists' abilities to shield sources in federal court proceedings. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The motion comes one week after the groups <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/gacomplaint_20110602.pdf">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">report</a>] in the <a href="http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia</a> [official website] against <a href="http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb87.htm">HB 87</a>, which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">signed into law last month</a> [JURIST report]. The law, which the groups claims was inspired by Arizona's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q="SB 1070">SB 1070</a> [JURIST news archive], allows authorities to ask individuals to produce papers to prove their immigration status during routine stops, allows law enforcement to detain individuals that fail to produce the necessary papers and makes it a crime for Georgians to interact with undocumented individuals. The groups <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/aclu-nilc-and-civil-rights-coalition-ask-court-block-implementation-georgias">contend</a> [press release] that the law violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures, violates the Supremacy Clause by interfering with the federal government's right to regulate immigration and impedes the right to travel freely throughout the US. Group members argue that the court needs to grant the injunction to prevent the law from infringing on the rights of immigrants as well as Georgians who are US citizens:<blockquote>Unless this law is blocked, countless Georgians&#8212;native-born and immigrant alike&#8212;will suffer grave constitutional rights violations, be subject to racial profiling or criminalized because of their interactions with their neighbors and family. These people should not be subject to these irreparable harms simply because an unconstitutional law is on the books.</blockquote>The law is set to go into effect on July 1.

<p>The Georgia suit does not mark the first time the ACLU and other groups have taken legal action against immigration laws in recent months. Last month, the ACLU filed a class action suit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">challenging an Indiana immigration law</a> [JURIST report] that requires individuals to provide proof of their legal status at all times and calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only. Also last month, the ACLU and other groups filed a class action suit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">against a Utah immigration law</a> [JURIST report] that requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. Similar legislation has also been approved in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports]. Arizona's law, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law last April</a>, is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">enjoined</a>, and Governor Jan Brewer has <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-ask-supreme-court-to-lift-injunction-on-controversial-immigration-law.php">pledged to appeal to the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Utah Code &#167;&#167; <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_10_120600.htm">76-10-1206</a> and <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_10_123300.htm">76-10-1233</a> [texts] regulate Internet material, including artwork, photography and graphic novels that might be "harmful to minors." In its <a href="http://www.acluutah.org/82-Memo,%20motion%20for%20summary%20judgment.pdf">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] supporting the <a href="http://www.acluutah.org/81-Pls%20motion%20for%20summary%20judgment.pdf">motion for summary judgment</a> [text, PDF], the ACLU argues that the statutes violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a> [text] and the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and are unconstitutionally vague. The ACLU contends that the burdens of the Utah statutes outweigh the benefits: <blockquote>Although protecting minors from material harmful to them is an important goal, it is a goal the Challenged Statutes cannot achieve. The State concedes that the Challenged Statutes "will not reduce the availability in Utah of material that may be harmful to minors over the Internet." This conclusion is almost unavoidable in light of the fact that a significant portion&#8212;perhaps even most&#8212;of all sexual content on the Internet is hosted overseas (and is thus far outside of the reach of the Challenged Statutes). In light of these facts and the State' concession, no significant local benefit exists. On the other hand, the burdens associated with the Utah statutes are substantial and include chilling the First Amendment activities of entire classes of adult Americans.</blockquote>The statutes, which were passed in 2005, have not been enforced because Utah consented to a temporary injunction.

<p>In 2008, the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/072539p.pdf">affirmed</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/third-circuit-enjoins-enforcement-of.php">report</a>] a lower court's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions/07D0346P.pdf">decision</a> [PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/child-online-protection-act-struck-down.php">report</a>] granting a permanent injunction against enforcement of the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode47/usc_sec_47_00000231----000-.html">Child Online Protection Act</a> (COPA) [text], a federal law that imposes civil and criminal penalties on website operators for making sexually explicit materials available to minors over the Internet. The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/freespeech/internet/36071prs20080722.html">lauded</a> [press release] the Third Circuit's decision, calling it a "clear victory for free speech." In 2004, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2004/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-strikes.htm">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-1293.ZO.html">Ashcroft v. ACLU</a> [opinion, text] that COPA was likely an unconstitutional violation of free speech and remanded the case to a lower court for findings on what technology, if any, would allow adults to see and buy material while keeping that material out of the hands of children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A French husband and wife, who have chosen to remain anonymous, argue that the ban <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jBmzJ-CE_RDcivTRZcKb6e_T0AMg?docId=CNG.8a8d0252fc37e292cdfbd4988e7aeee9.611">restricts their right to free movement</a> [AFP report] across the EU. They are seeking &#163; 10,000 (USD $16,400) for the claimed human rights breach, The couple is being represented by Robina Shah of the <a href="http://www.iasuk.org/non-profit-fee-paying-service.aspx">Immigration Advisory Service in Birmingham</a> [advocacy website] and claim they were forced to leave France because of the ban. The controversial French law bans the wearing of full Muslim veils, including burqas, nigabs and other facial coverings in public. Also on Thursday, a Spanish court overturned a lower court ruling and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gXqVS-oBNZ06h9cJUe0bKYOArpeQ?docId=4245f28687564eaca56ccd8b711a20a5">upheld a ban on the Muslim face coverings</a> [AP report] for identification and security purposes. The city of Lleida, in Catalonia, was the first Spanish city to impose such a ban, but only about 3 percent of its population is Muslim.

<p>Under the French ban, people caught wearing facial coverings in public can be fined &#8364; 150 (USD $215) and/or ordered to take a citizenship class. In addition, anyone convicted of forcing a someone else to cover their face may be <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hEgiMW33brZhPohZrPSXS_zbE8lQ?docId=CNG.454c1042a774374e5f29a46c701d14b2.7b1">fined up to 30,000 euro and jailed for one year</a> [AFP report, in French], and the penalties double if the incident involves a minor. The ban affects citizens, residents and tourists alike, and extends to <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2011/04/08/01016-20110408ARTFIG00630-voile-signes-religieux-ce-qui-est-interdit-en-france.php">all public places</a> [<em>Le Figaro</em> backgrounder, in French], including airports, hospitals, government offices and even places of worship that are open to the public. In October, the French Constitutional Council ruled that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-constitutional-court-approves-burqa-ban.php">ban conforms with the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. The bill was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/france-parliament-approves-burqa-ban.php">National Assembly</a> in July and by the <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/france-senate-approves-burqa-ban.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports] in September. Legislation banning the use of Islamic burqas has been a point of contention recently in many European countries. In October, Dutch politician <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=5&Itemid=103">Geert Wilders</a> [personal website, in Dutch] said that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-lawmaker-announces-plans-to-ban-burqa.php">Netherlands will ban the burqa</a> [JURIST report] as part of the government's plan to form a minority coalition. In August, Austria's conservative <a href="http://www.fpoe.at/">Freedom Party</a> [official website, in German] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/conservative-austria-party-calls-for-vote-to-ban-minarets-face-veils.php">special vote</a> [JURIST report] on whether to ban face veils and the construction of minarets, two of the most visible symbols of the Islamic faith. In July, Spain's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/spain-lower-house-rejects-proposal-to-ban-burqa.php">rejected a proposal</a> [JURIST report] to ban the burqa and other full face veils by a vote of 183 to 162 with two abstaining.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] Thursday condemned reported violence by Syria against its own people, calling on it to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">allow UN investigators into the country</a> [press release]. Pillay said that reports show the number killed since protests began last March has exceeded 1,100 with up to 10,000 in detention, noting that at least 50 people were killed in a protest last Friday. In April, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] authorized an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into reports of violence against protesters, but Pillay said that Syria has not responded to official requests to allow UN fact-finders into the country. Pillay urged Syria to stop using the military against protesters:<blockquote>We are receiving an increasing number of alarming reports pointing to the Syrian Government's continuing efforts to ruthlessly crush civilian protests. It is utterly deplorable for any government to attempt to bludgeon its population into submission, using tanks, artillery and snipers. I urge the Government to halt this assault on its own people's most fundamental human rights.</blockquote>Despite a not being able to enter the country, the UN fact-finding commission is still expected to file its report on June 15.

<p>This is not the first time Pillay has called on Syria to end violence. In April, she urged Syria to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Syria has also been reluctant to allow UN relief efforts into the country. Last month, a UN rights official <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-official-concerned-over-syria-relief-access.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding humanitarian aid access to Syrian cities where armed forces have been trying to put down anti-government protests. Repeated entreaties to Syrian authorities for access were unsuccessful. Even a direct phone call from UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] to Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] regarding the proposed assessment proved unavailing. In April, the UNHRC, in emergency special session, <a href="http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4174311.PDF">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. Additionally, the council immediately called for a full investigation of "all alleged violations of international human rights law" in Syria. Also in April, Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended the 48-year-old state of emergency</a> [JURIST report], an event of significant historical note, but protests have continued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court upheld last year's decision by former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5346744.stm">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> [BBC profile] against extradition and ordered that Battisti be released from a Brasilia prison. In 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Court <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=116280">voted 5-to-4 to extradite</a> [press release, in Portuguese; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/brazil-top-court-rules-for-extradition.php">report</a>] Battisti, but left the final decision to Lula, who granted him asylum earlier that same year. In December 2010, Lula denied the extradition request. Italy <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2011/06/20116994141789497.html">said it would appeal</a> [Al Jazeera report] the high court decision to the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] in The Hague. Italian <a href="http://www.governo.it/">President Silvio Berlusconi</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.governo.it/Presidente/Comunicati/dettaglio.asp?d=63883">denounced</a> [press release, in Italian] the Brazil court's decision.

<p>Lula granted Battisti political refugee status in January 2009 due to doubts about the fairness of his trial where he was convicted <em>in absentia</em> of four murders in the late 1970s. Battisti has firmly protested his extradition, going on a  <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8360452.stm">hunger strike</a> [BBC report] in the Brazilian prison where he is being held. Italy considers Battisti a terrorist and has been pressuring the Brazilian government to extradite him. Battisti was sentenced to life in prison in Italy for murders committed by the Armed Proletarians for Communism, an arm of a radical communist group known as the Red Brigades to which Battisti belonged. He <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7830449.stm">escaped</a> [BBC report] from an Italian prison in 1981 and fled to Brazil after spending 10 years as a refugee in France. Battisti was arrested in Rio de Janeiro in March 2007. Other members of the Red Brigades group have been convicted for murders in Italy over the past few years. In 2005, three members, who were among five people <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/convicted-killers-of-italian.php">sentenced</a> to life in prison for the murder of government economic advisor Marco Biagi, were <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/red-brigades-members-get-second-life.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to another life term for the murder of Massimo D'Antona, a professor and legal consultant to the Minister of Labour. The murders occurred three years apart, but both victims were government advisers who were killed to deter reforms which would introduce greater flexibility to Italy's labor market. Four defendants were acquitted and nine other defendants received sentences ranging from four to 10 years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Iowa House <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">passed a late-term abortion ban in April</a> [JURIST report], but the Senate decided not to vote on the bill by a <a href = "http://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/pubs/sjweb/pdf/May%2016,%202011.pdf#page=3">slim margin of 26 - 23</a> [Senate Journal text, PDF]. The Senate later introduced <a href = "http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/SF534_Introduced.pdf">SF-534</a> [text, PDF], forcing late-term abortion providers' clinics to be "located in close proximity to a hospital licensed [...] that is a level II regional neonatology center." There are only <a href = "http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2011/05/16/divided-iowa-senate-approves-abortion-clinic-bill/">five hospitals with neonatal wards in Iowa</a> [<em>Des Moines Register</em> report], in the state's four major cities. The House's bill amends SF-534 significantly, banning abortions after the beginning of the gestation period, which occurs at a woman's last period before her pregnancy, thus potentially banning abortions as early as 18 weeks. There is no exception in the bill for the health of the mother, although there is for her life.<blockquote>Any person who intentionally terminates a human pregnancy, with the knowledge and voluntary consent of the pregnant person, after a gestation period of twenty completed weeks where death of the fetus results commits feticide. Feticide is a class C felony. Any person who attempts to intentionally terminate a human pregnancy, with the knowledge and voluntary consent of the pregnant person, after a gestation period of twenty completed weeks where death of the fetus does not result commits attempted feticide. Attempted feticide is a class D felony.</blockquote>These felony charges could attach 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. It is unknown when the Senate will vote on the bill, but it is unlikely they will ratify it. 

<p>The Obama administration took a stand earlier this month against a controversial Indiana law that prevents health care providers with abortion services from receiving Medicaid funds, saying the law <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">violates federal law</a> [JURIST report]. Several other states have acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. Last month, <a href = "http://www.plannedparenthood.org/index.htm">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href = "http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota law requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota <a href = "http://markdayton.org/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas <a href = "http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] signed into law a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to first get a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Supreme Court affirmed a <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] ruling, which <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/09-1504r.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/federal-appeals-court-rules-against.php">report</a>] that a challenger to a patent claim must prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. In 2007, <a href="http://www.i4i.com/">i4i</a> [corporate website] claimed that Microsoft's products infringed i4i's patent, which "claims an improved method for editing computer documents, which stores a document's content separately from the metacodes associated with the document's structure." &#167; 282 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/patent/patent.overview.html">Patent Act of 1952</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 1&#8211;376 text] declares that "[a] patent shall be presumed valid" and "[t]he burden of establishing invalidity of a patent or any claim thereof shall rest on the party asserting such invalidity." Microsoft claimed it needed to prove the patent invalid by a preponderance of the evidence. Justice Sotomoyor, writing for the court, said that common law precedent established a higher burden for patent challengers:<blockquote>[B]y the time Congress enacted &#167;282 and declared that a patent is "presumed valid," the presumption of patent validity had long been a fixture of the common law. According to its settled meaning, a defendant raising an invalidity defense bore "a heavy burden of persuasion," requiring proof of the defense by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>Accordingly, she wrote, Congress adopted that high standard when it enacted the Patent Act in 1952, even though the Act does not expressly mention the burden of proof. Chief Justice John Roberts did not take part in the consideration or decision.

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito, filed a concurring opinion emphasizing that the "clear and convincing evidence" standard of proof applies to fact finding, and not to finding questions of law. Justice Clarence Thomas also wrote a concurring opinion disagreeing with the majority's assertion that Congress codified a standard of proof within the language of the Patent Act. In other words, though Congress stated "a patent shall be presumed valid," it did not necessarily mean to attach the "clear and convincing evidence" standard typically associated with such language.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Contrary to AT&#38;T's assertion, there is no danger that deferring to the Commission would effectively "permit the agency, under the guise of interpreting a regulation, to create de facto a new regulation."</blockquote>The case was consolidated with <a href = "http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0052p-06.pdf">Isiogu v. Michigan Bell Telephone Co.</a> [Sixth Circuit opinion text, PDF]. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the decision. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred, stating he agreed with the result, but suggested a change in the Court's reliance on the "Auer deference": "But when an agency promulgates an imprecise rule, it leaves to itself the implementation of that rule, and thus the initial determination of the rule's meaning. ... It seems contrary to fundamental principles of separation of powers to permit the person who promulgates a law to interpret it as well."

<p>The cases centered on charges for "entrance facilities." Essentially, to ensure fair competition, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the major telecommunications companies to grant access to their network, as well as other provisions, to smaller telecommunications companies. In this instance, Michigan Bell (AT&#38;T in the region), could charge only cost-based rates to competitors, rather than market-based. Further, the FCC found that Michigan Bell had an obligation to aid competitors in "connecting" to their entrance facilities. </p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the harsher sentences under a federal anti-drug statute for "cocaine base" applied to more than just "crack cocaine," but to all forms of cocaine in its basic form. All the justices joined in the opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor rejecting an argument that the term "cocaine base" in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/841.html">Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986</a> (ADAA) [21 USC &#167; 841(a), <em>as amended</em>] referred only to "crack cocaine." The ADAA imposes harsher penalties for those convicted of selling "cocaine base" than the penalties for "powder cocaine." Franz DePierre argued was convicted for selling two bags of cocaine base to government informant. At trial, a federal district court judge denied his request that the jury be instructed that in order to find him guilty of the cocaine base crime they must find that it involved crack cocaine. The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/08-2101P-01A.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] that decision. The Supreme Court held that Congress' use of the term "cocaine base" was broader than "crack cocaine" referring to base forms of cocaine rather than the powder form. The Court recognized that chemically cocaine is a base by definition but said it was Congress' intention to distinguish that the harsher penalties did not apply to powder cocaine. The Court also rejected DePierre's argument that since the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/">US Sentencing Commission</a> (USSC) [official website] changed its definition of cocaine base to mean crack cocaine that the Court should do the same with the ADAA. Under the ADAA at the time, there was a 100:1 ratio for sentences between powder cocaine and cocaine base where to receive a five-year sentence an individual would have to be convicted of selling 500 kilograms of powder cocaine compared to just 5 kilograms of cocaine base.   

<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-definition-of-cocaine-base-patent-rights.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in this case in February, in which DePierre's counsel argued that the ADAA was passed to address the specific problem of crack cocaine so Congress must have intended "cocaine base" to mean "crack cocaine." The Obama administration is trying to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences. Earlier this month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] testified before the USSC calling for the retroactive application of a new law bringing the sentences for crack cocaine more in line for those of powder cocaine. The USSC is considering retroactively applying the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:S1789:">Fair Sentencing Act</a> [S 1789 materials] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-signs-bill-to-reduce-cocaine-sentencing-disparity.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by President Barack Obama last year. However, all the courts of appeals that have heard cases on the new law's retroactivity have <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/a-us-appeals-court-holds-fair-sentencing-act-is-not-retroactive.php">held against it</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">passed by the Alabama legislature</a> [JURIST report] last week, includes measures comparable to those <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">passed in Arizona</a> [JURIST report] last year. The bill permits police officers to detain a person stopped for a traffic violation if the officer has "reasonable suspicion" the person is in the country illegally. The officer must then try to determine the individual's identity by checking other records if the motorist is unable to provide documentation. The bill also requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify system</a> [official website] to determine whether potential employees are legal residents. Businesses cited multiple times for hiring undocumented workers could lose their business licenses. Furthermore, undocumented immigrants are prohibited from applying for a job, and anyone transporting or harboring undocumented immigrants will be punished by a fine or jail time. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website] announced that it, along with other civil liberties groups, will <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/aclu-file-lawsuit-challenging-alabamas-new-anti-immigrant-law">challenge the constitutionality</a> [press release] of the law. ACLU of Alabama Executive Director Olivia Turner condemned the governor's decision:<blockquote>By signing this bill into law, Gov. Bentley is willing to sacrifice the civil liberties of all Alabamans, eroding the rights of millions of people living and working in this state. This law undermines core American values of fairness and equality, subjecting both citizens and non-citizens alike to unlawful racial profiling, and does nothing to ensure the safety and economic security of Alabama.</blockquote>Alabama's law, which will go into effect on September 1, is more restrictive than Arizona's employment immigration law, which the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] last month.

<p>Early in June, the ACLU, the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [official website] and a coalition of other civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">filed a class action</a> [JURIST report] lawsuit challenging a similar Georgia immigration law. Last month, the Supreme Court upheld an Arizona employment law that imposes penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants, ruling that the law is not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> (IRCA) [text]. The ruling opens the door for states to enact similar restraints on immigration. Several states have already <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">enacted</a> or <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/florida-ag-proposes-arizona-style-immigration-law.php">proposed</a> [JURIST reports] tough new immigration laws. In March, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oksenate.gov/">Oklahoma State Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill that would give police officers the authority to question the citizenship status of any person lawfully stopped for a traffic violation and arrest them without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally. Also in March, Utah <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed</a> an immigration law requiring police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor, but a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST reports] it less than 24 hours after it took effect. In February, the <a href="http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/indiana-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring suspected illegal immigrants to provide proof of their legal status and calls for all public meetings, websites, and documents to be in English only.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Spanish National Court in January sought Demjanjuk's extradition so he could stand trial on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity relating to his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/othercamps/flossenburg.html">Flossenburg</a> [HRP backgrounder] concentration camp where 60 Spanish citizens were killed during World War II. The German court said Spanish authorities <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/wires/ap/news/world/20110609_ap_germancourtdeniesrequesttoextraditedemjanjuk.html?c=r">failed to provide requested information</a> [AP report] about whether Demjanjuk was involved in the alleged crimes. The German court also indicated that Spain likely did not have jurisdiction over the case because the alleged crimes took place in Germany and Germany's statute of limitations had expired.

<p>A German court in May <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">convicted Demjanjuk</a> [JURIST report] on 28,060 counts of helping to murder thousands during the Holocaust, sentencing him to five years in prison and then releasing him pending appeal. The judge found that Demjanjuk, 91, served as a guard at the at the Sobidor death camp, assisting in the deaths of nearly 28,000 Jews. The five-year sentence is less than the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-prosecutor-requests-6-year-sentence-for-alleged-nazi-guard.php">six years sought by the prosecution</a> [JURIST report]. Judge Ralph Alt <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15068941,00.html">ordered his release</a> [DW report] because of his advanced age and because the verdict is not final. Demjanjuk's trial, which <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/germany-court-begins-trial-of-accused.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009, was marked by extensive delay. Last May, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/germany-court-rejects-motion-to-dismiss-charges-against-alleged-nazi-guard.php">denied a motion to dismiss the charges</a> [JURIST report] filed by the defense, which argued there was a lack of credible evidence. The court rejected the argument, saying they found the evidence against Demjanjuk to be strong. In October 2009, Demjanjuk was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/germany-court-rules-accused-nazi-guard.php">found fit to stand trial</a> after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/germany-court-blocks-stay-of.php">rejected appeals relating to his health</a> [JURIST reports], although the court limited hearings to no more than two 90-minute sessions per day. Demjanjuk fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. He was deported to Germany after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/supreme-court-justice-rejects-stay-of.php">denied his stay of deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p></p>]]></content:encoded>

The same is true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree. The attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an officer's authority. It is a provocative and dangerous act that dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give chase. The felon's conduct gives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something more serious than a traffic violation to hide.</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurrence. Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, dissented, writing that she believes there are too many distinctions in ways to flee a police officer to rule all of them "violent felonies": "a person may fail to heed an officer's command to pull over, but otherwise drive in a lawful manner, perhaps just trying to find a better place to stop." Justice Antonin Scalia also dissented, and focused his remarks on the vagueness of the ACCA.<blockquote>We try to include an ACCA residual-clause case in about every second or third volume of the United States Reports. As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clarification of the Delphic residual clause, today's opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion. Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. Four times is enough. We should admit that ACCA's residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.</blockquote>Kennedy addressed this in the majority opinion: "Although this approach may at times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congressional power to enact."

<p>The residual clause of the ACCA states that, "the term 'violent felony' means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another." The ACCA's intent is to impose harsher and longer sentences on "career criminals." The Court has analyzed it several times in recent terms. Earlier this month, the Court unanimously ruled in <A HREF = "/paperchase/2011/06/jurist-the-us-supreme-court.php">McNeill v. United States</a> [JURIST report] that a federal sentencing court must determine whether "an offense under State law" is a "serious drug offense" under the ACCA by consulting the "maximum term of imprisonment" applicable to a defendant's prior state drug offense at the time of the defendant's conviction for that offense. In March 2010, they ruled in <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-rules-violent-felony.php">Johnson v. United States</a> [JURIST report] that a "violent felony" requires the use of physical force. The Court declared in <a href = "/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-rules-failure-to-report.php">Chambers v. United States</a> [JURIST report] that failure to report to prison does not constitute a "violent felony" in January 2009. <a href = "/paperchase/2008/05/us-supreme-court-rules-on-repeat.php">United States v. Rodriquez</a> [JURIST report], decided in May 2008, clarified that for purposes of increasing a sentence under the ACCA a conviction qualifies as a predicate serious drug offense even when the crime is made punishable by a 10-year prison term only because of additional penalties imposed on repeat offenders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiff, recorded as Jane Roe to protect her identity, argued that MUMA required her employer to exempt her from its drug test policy for legal medical use of marijuana outside the workplace. Since the original MUMA language explicitly protects employers from being required to accommodate on-site medical use of marijuana, Roe argued the statute then implicitly requires employer accommodation of medical marijuana use outside the workplace. The court disagreed:<blockquote>Amicus Pacific Legal Foundation aptly addressed the logical fallacy of Roe's argument. ... As amicus explains, when the major premise is a universal negative (employers are not required to accommodate on-site use), and the minor premise negates one aspect of the major (the plaintiff uses marijuana off- site), it is logically invalid to adopt as a conclusion the contrapositive (employers are required to accommodate off-site use).</blockquote>In an 8-1 decision the court concluded that MUMA does not prohibit an employer from discharging an employee for medical marijuana use, nor does it provide a civil remedy against the employer. MUMA also does not proclaim a sufficient public policy to give rise to a tort action for wrongful termination for authorized use of medical marijuana.

<p>The decriminalization of marijuana has been a contentious issue. Last week the <a href="http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/international-commission-recommends-legalizing-marijuana.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] calling for the international legalization of cannabis, marijuana and other drugs. The panel emphasized treatment and programs that discourage children from taking drugs, rather than relying on harsh punishments. The report stated that the <a href="http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf">UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961</a> [text, PDF] and the US's "War on Drugs" both have failed. Last month, Arizona <a href = "http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-file-lawsuit-over-controversial-state-medical-marijuana-law.php">federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a declaratory judgment over the legality under federal law of the State's <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-medical-marijuana-law.php">legalization of medical marijuana</a> [JURIST report] passed in November 2010. Medical marijuana is currently legal in 14 US states. In October 2009, US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] issued <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">guidelines for a new policy</a> [JURIST report] for investigating and prosecuting state-sanctioned medical marijuana use. Those guidelines reflect a pledge made by Holder in March to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/doj-to-end-raids-on-medical-marijuana.php">stop federal raids</a> [JURIST report] on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state laws. However, Holder has emphasized that if a state legalizes drugs for recreational use,  as California <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/western-voter-reject-propositions-to-expand-access-to-legalized-marijuana.php">attempted last year</a> [JURIST report], <a href = "http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/16/local/la-me-marijuana-holder-20101016">federal law will be enforced</a> [LAT report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU filed a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552----000-.html">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &#167; 552; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=FOIA">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/wikileaks_foia_request.pdf">request</a> [text, PDF] for 23 embassy cables, to which the government has yet to respond. The embassy cables contain information about diplomatic responses to US abduction, interrogation, detention and rendition practices and President Obama's decision to withhold photographs of US interrogations, as well as information about the prosecution and release of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees and use of unmanned aerial vehicles. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/">Le Monde</a>, <a href="http://www.elpais.com/global/">El Pais</a> and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/">Der Spiegel</a> [media websites] published articles in November 2010 based on documents alleged to be the embassy cables, which were released by Wikileaks. ACLU demanded that the documents be released by the government agency as a matter of public interest and increased understanding of government operations and activities. The ACLU National Security Project Litigation Director Ben Wizner condemned the government's conduct:<blockquote>Our current secrecy regime has become completely untethered from reality. The government's insistence that information published throughout the world remains 'classified' is not only ridiculous&#8212;it's a legal fiction that has permitted government officials to evade liability for illegal conduct. All too often, the government has employed secrecy not to protect the nation from harm, but to protect the powerful from embarrassment and accountability.</blockquote>The ACLU is seeking immediate release of the requested documents.

<p>In January, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/366C64CA4610E5528525781C0054EC33/$file/09-5386-1288282.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the US government does <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-court-dismisses-aclu-request-for-guantanamo-transcripts.php">not have to release</a> [JURIST report] non-redacted transcripts requested by the ACLU relating to the interrogation of certain "high value" detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/aclu-renews-calls-for-bush-era-detainee-torture-investigation.php">chastised the Obama administration</a> [JURIST report] in June 2010 for shielding Bush administration officials from civil suit and criminal prosecution in relation to the treatment of detainees in US custody. That same month, the ACLU highlighted formerly classified torture-related documents in honor of <a href="http://www.tortureawareness.com/">Torture Awareness Month</a> [official website]. In April 2010, another ACLU FOIA suit resulted in the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cia-documents-reveal-possible-cover-up.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of internal <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p01-09.pdf">documents</a> [part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p10-18.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">part 3</a>, PDF] revealing that a former agency head may have agreed to the destruction of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive] showing harsh interrogations of terror suspects.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Municipal Court in Zagreb charged that he was <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=06&dd=09&nav_id=74838&version=print">aware of atrocities against civilians</a> [B92 report], but prevented other officials from mitigating damages against them. The indictment goes on to charge that he ordered detentions, torture and executions of Serbian civilians. Mercep was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/top-croatia-official-arrested-for-war-crimes.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December, and Croatian officials were nearing a deadline to release him without a formal indictment. No date has been set for a hearing, nor is it clear that Mercep will be tried in Croatia. Coinciding with Mercep's indictment is the announcement that Croatia is slated for <a href = "http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] <a href = "http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110609/wl_nm/us_croatia_warcrimes">acceptance in 2013</a> [Reuters report].

<p><a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE201012081974&lang=e">press release</a>] calling for the prosecution of individuals responsible for war crimes the day before Mercep's arrest. In November, a Croatian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/croatia-court-sentences-6-men-for-2008-death-of-journalist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six men to 15 to 40 years in prison for their roles in the 2008 killing of a Croatian journalist. In 2008, AI called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTY">news archive</a>] investigating war crimes in the area.

The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced in April that al-Nashiri would be tried in a military court and would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/accused-uss-cole-bomber-to-be-tried-in-military-court.php">subject to capital charges</a> [JURIST report]. The EP emphasized in a <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=MOTION&reference=B7-2011-0371&format=XML&language=EN">resolution</a> [materials] the importance of the parliament's relationship with the US and restated its opposition to the use of torture, ill-treatment and the death penalty under all circumstances, reiterating that the "abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights." The resolution also noted that al-Nashiri alleged he was held and tortured in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+secret+prisons">secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST news archive] in Poland.

<p>In May, lawyers for al-Nashiri said that they have <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/focus/national-security/news/nashiri-echr-20110510">filed suit</a> [press release; <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/litigation/nashiri">case materials</a>; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-uss-cole-bomber-sues-poland-over-secret-cia-prison-site.php">report</a>] against Poland in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] over his alleged torture at the Polish CIA prison. In March, Polish prosecutors investigating the alleged prison announced that they were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/poland-prosecutors-ask-us-to-question-guantanamo-detainees-over-secret-cia-prison.php">asking US officials to question al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST report] and a second Guantanamo Bay detainee who claims he was held and abused at the site. The <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website], which helped to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">launch the abuse investigation</a> [JURIST report] last September, urged the US to provide assistance. The investigation into al-Nashiri's allegations of the secret prison's existence and his abuse there began soon after former Polish prime minister Leszek Miller <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-ex-pm-denies-knowledge-of-cia-secret-prison.php">denied any knowledge of a secret CIA prison</a> [JURIST report] in Poland. His denial followed confirmation by a former CIA agent that the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,717166,00.html">agency tortured</a> [Spiegel report] al-Nashiri in 2002 at a secret prison located in Poland. According to the agent, al-Nashiri was stripped naked and hooded before a gun and a drill were held close to his head. Former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski has also denied the existence of the prisons. Both he and Miller maintain that they will not discuss the allegations of torture until the completion of an investigation into Poland's role in the US prisoner <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program. The original investigation into the existence of the CIA-operated prison was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-investigating-claims-of-cia.php">launched by the Polish government</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

EC President Jose Barroso stated that Croatia has made significant enough improvements in their final four "chapters," Competition, Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, Financial and Budgetary Provisions and Other Issues, to allow closure of the chapters and ultimate accession.<blockquote>This important step forward by Croatia towards membership is also a signal to the rest to of South Eastern Europe: It shows that enlargement works, that the EU is serious about its commitment, and that structural European reforms in the countries pay off. I therefore hope that Croatia's progress is an inspiration to our other partners to reinvigorate their reform efforts and to deliver to the benefit of their people. This is also in the EU's self-interest. As I saw again during my two recent visits to the region, a credible enlargement policy remains our most important tool for strengthening mutual stability and prosperity in South Eastern Europe.</blockquote>Croatia's <a href = "http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/o_vladi_rh/clanovi_vlade/jadranka_kosor_dipl_iur">Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor</a> [academic profile] <a href = "http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2011/lipanj/predsjednica_vlade_kosor_s_britanskim_premijerom_cameronom">expressed her delight at the announcement</a> [press release]. Countries still awaiting acceptance into the EU and are in formal negotiations include <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/iceland/index_en.htm">Iceland</a>, <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/the_former_yugoslav_republic_of_macedonia/index_en.htm">Macedonia</a>, <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/montenegro/index_en.htm">Montenegro</a> and <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/index_en.htm">Turkey</a> [EC materials]. It was also announced on Friday that <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidates/serbia/index_en.htm">Serbia</a> [EC materials] will become a <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=06&dd=10&nav_id=74853&version=print">candidate country next year</a> [B92 report], with talks starting in the spring.

<p>Croatia has been increasing efforts to reform their judiciary in order to gain accession to the EU. On Thursday, Croatian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-indicts-former-interior-minister-for-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former military commander and senior interior minister <a href="http://www.biografije.org/mercep.htm">Tomislav Mercep</a> [official profile, in Croatian] for war crimes committed against Serbians during the 1990s conflict in the Balkans. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE201012081974&lang=e">press release</a>] calling for the prosecution of individuals responsible for war crimes the day before Mercep's arrest. In 2008, AI called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTY">news archive</a>] investigating war crimes in the area. The entry talks were resumed in October of that year after the ICTY declared that Croatia was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/icty-says-croatia-now-cooperating-on.php">fully cooperating</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill contains no exceptions for cases of rape or incest, but would permit an abortion if necessary to prevent the death of or serious risk of injury to the woman. The bill also requires physicians to report instances of abortions to the <a href="http://www.adph.org/">Department of Public Health</a> [official website] and requires the department to issue an annual public report containing abortion-related statistics. Physicians who perform abortions in violation of the law would face criminal charges, injunctions, as well as actions for actual damages brought by the both the mother and father of the unborn child. The bill will now proceed to Alabama <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] for signing.  

<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy</a> [JURIST report], making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. The Obama administration took a stand earlier this month against a controversial Indiana law that prevents health care providers with abortion services from receiving Medicaid funds, saying the law <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">violates federal law</a> [JURIST report]. Several other states have acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. Last month, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/index.htm">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota law requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota <a href="http://markdayton.org/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] signed into law a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to first get a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bokova called for the government to restore citizens' access to cell phones and the Internet and to stop "acts of aggression" against journalists. <blockquote>Reports coming from Syria are alarming. The rights of citizens must be respected, as must the rights and security of journalists. This includes the right to freedom of expression, the need to access information and the ability to communicate. The decision to shut down internet access and cell phone networks, to block broadcasters and prevent journalists from doing their job is not acceptable.</blockquote>Syrian communications have been <a href = "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle09.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/April/middleeast_April36.xml&section=middleeast">down since early April</a> [AFP report]. Although a <a href = "http://www.sana.sy/eng/21/2011/06/02/350490.htm">new media law has recently been proposed</a> [SANA report] to allow more freedom for journalists, including releasing some imprisoned journalists, rights for journalists in the country are still haphazard. Recently, Dorothy Paravaz, a reporter for Al Jazeera, was detained in Syria and then deported to Iran, where she was <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/05/2011518184325620380.html">held for 19 days</a> [Al Jazeera report].

<p>Yesterday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-chief-calls-on-syria-to-stop-violence-against-its-people.php">condemned reported violence</a> [JURIST report] by Syria against its own people, calling on it to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/Media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">allow UN investigators into the country</a> [press release]. This is not the first time Pillay has called on Syria to end violence. In April, she urged Syria to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Syria has also been reluctant to allow UN relief efforts into the country. Last month, a UN rights official <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-official-concerned-over-syria-relief-access.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] regarding humanitarian aid access to Syrian cities where armed forces have been trying to put down anti-government protests. Repeated entreaties to Syrian authorities for access were unsuccessful. Even a direct phone call from UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] to Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] regarding the proposed assessment proved unavailing. In April, the UNHRC, in emergency special session, <a href="http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4174311.PDF">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. Additionally, the council immediately called for a full investigation of "all alleged violations of international human rights law" in Syria. Also in April, Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended the 48-year-old state of emergency</a> [JURIST report], an event of significant historical note, but protests have continued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Several paramilitary soldiers opened fire on an unarmed, 22-year-old man in Benazir Park, then stood by as he died. The incident was caught on tape and disseminated by television and Internet media sources. The rangers filed a First Information Report (FIR) detailing the events of the incident. Chief Justice <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/page.asp?id=204">Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [official website] said the rangers' version of the story contradicted the video footage, and ordered the attorney general, the head of Pakistan's Rangers paramilitary force and other government officials to appear in court with a complete record of the incident. The chief justice condemned the rangers for failing to file any reports about the incident until after the victim's brother filed a report at the police station: <blockquote>[I]t was not only the duty of the police concerned but of the Provincial Police Officer as well as Director General Rangers, to take notice of the matter, as they must have learnt about the incident which was widely aired by the electronic media and there was a lot of hue and cry regarding this incident; furthermore the family of the deceased along with other citizens had also started raising voice against highhandedness of these law enforcing agencies. Surprisingly, when the case ... was registered ... the custody of remaining persons, who were very much visible at the scene of crime, were not handed over nor the police demanded them for the purpose of investigation. As far as the awareness of the incident is concerned, it was very much available on all TV Channels.</blockquote>The chief justice also accused the rangers of deliberately misrepresenting the incident in an effort to conceal their conduct. The two suspects are currently in police custody as the investigation proceeds.

<p>Human rights groups have expressed concern over Pakistan's human rights record. In April, the <a href="http://www.hrcp-web.org/default.asp">Human Rights Commission of Pakistan</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/pakistan-criticized-for-human-rights-violations.php">harshly criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Pakistani government for its poor human rights record and called on government officials to fix the human rights abuses occurring in the country. In its <a href="http://www.hrcp-web.org/Publications/AR2010.pdf">2010 Annual Report</a> [text, PDF], the group chronicled the repeated human rights violations that have taken place in the country over the past year, citing growing intolerance and extremism in the country. The government was also blamed for its inability to reform <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blasphemy">blasphemy laws</a> and abolish the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abolish+death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archives]. Also in April, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the 2010 <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials], criticizing the governments of Afghanistan and <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154485.htm">Pakistan</a> [materials] for their conduct in the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda. However, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-lawmakers-elect-bhutto-widower.php">2008 Pakistani elections</a> [JURIST report] were deemed "competitive and reflective of the people's will," restoring democratic rule and leading to some human rights progress. UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] in March <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-pakistan-blasphemy-law.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the assassination of Pakistani Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti and expressed her opposition to Pakistan's controversial blasphemy law. Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] during an argument with other women in her village last year. Bhatti had spoken out in favor of reforming the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Officials told the <a href = "http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] of their May visit to the Ivory Coast, during which they found both <a href = "http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Human-Rights-Violations-Were-Committed-In-Ivory-Coast-Conflict-123622149.html">general and systematic attacks and rapes</a> [VOA report] against citizens by opposing political groups. The UNHRC's official report will be released later next week, when it is considered by the UNHRC, though an <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.48_AUV.pdf">advance unedited copy</a> [text, PDF, in French] is available. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released a report last week detailing similar <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-reports-violence-continues-in-ivory-coast.php">alleged retaliatory attacks</a> [JURIST report] from Gbagbo and Ouattara's forces. Thursday, the <A href = "http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/minuci/">UN Mission in the Ivory Coast</a> (MINUCI) [official website] human rights officer Guillaume Ngefa also called for an <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13717088">investigation of Ouattara</a> [BBC report]. 

<p>Last month, Ouattara asked the <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/cote-divoire-president-asks-icc-to-launch-probe-into-crimes-after-disputed-november-election.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections last November.

In April, HRW <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also last month, the <a href = "http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There are also <a href = "https://twitter.com/#!/Stjornlagarad">Twitter</a> and <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/Stjornlagarad">Facebook</a> pages for comments, as well as a <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/stjornlagarad">YouTube channel</a> [official websites, in Icelandic] dedicated to the drafting process.<blockquote>The Constitutional Council is eager to make sure the public can be up to date while the work is in progress. It's possible to see the developments in the text of a prospective proposition and make comments. Furthermore, the Constitutional Council has made it possible for the public to send messages and already numerous messages have been sent to the Council. All messges are published on the Council's website under the sender's name (anonymous messages are not accepted) and the public can read and comment on each of them which has already created a lively discussion on the website. In this way the Constitutional Council emphasises an open communication with the Icelandic nation and has given the people an opportunity to participate in the formation of a new Constitution of the Republic of Iceland.</blockquote>Last year, Iceland also picked 1,000 citizens, with 4,000 alternates, at random from the national registry to attend the <a href = "http://www.thjodfundur2010.is/">National Conference on the Constitution</a> [official website, in Icelandic].

Last September, the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website, in Icelandic] referred charges to the Landsdomur after the SIC released a report claiming that seven Icelandic government officials acted with gross negligence in their management of the country's financial system prior to a 2008 bank collapse. The SIC also found that former minister of finance Arni Mathiessen, then-banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson, former <a href="http://www.fme.is/?PageID=146">Financial Services Authority</a> [official website] director Jonas Jonsson and central bank officials Eirikur Gundason and Ingimundur Fridriksson failed to take appropriate action when presented with information about the poor state of the country's financial sector.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After his capture in 2001 and detention at Guantanamo Bay, Almerfedi filed a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-orders-release-of-yemeni-guantanamo-detainee.php">granted</a> [JURIST] by a lower court. The government had argued that Almerfedi was a supporter of <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] because of his travels to Pakistan that indicated strong ties to the group.   However, the court concluded that the government had not met its burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Almerfedi was part of al Qaeda. On the contrary, the appeals court took a holistic approach and agreed that the government had met its burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence  that Almerfedi was, in fact, part of al Qaeda: <blockquote>First, Almerfedi acknowledges that he stayed for two and a half months at Jama'at Tablighi, an Islamic missionary organization that is a Terrorist Support Entity "closely aligned" with al Qaeda. ... [Second] if we add Almerfedi's travel route, which is quite at odds with his professed desire to travel to Europe (and brought him closer to the Afghan border where al Qaeda was fighting), and also that he had at least $2,000 of unexplained cash on his person when captured ... the government's case that Almerfedi is an al Qaeda facilitator is on firmer ground. ... We conclude that all three facts,when considered together, are adequate to carry the government's burden of deploying credible evidence that the habeas petitioner meets the enemy-combatant criteria.</blockquote>The court relied heavily on the notion that circumstantial evidence is often sufficient enough to keep a prisoner detained. 

<p>There have been over 200 writs of <em>habeas corpus</em> filed on behalf of  Guantanamo Bay detainees. Last month, a <a href="/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-denies-habeas-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">federal appeals court denied <em>habeas corpus</em></a> [JURIST report] to Guantanamo Bay detainee Musa'ab Omar al-Madhwani, concluding that he was lawfully detained for being part of al Qaeda. In March, an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-appeals-court-overturns-release-order-for-yemeni-guantanamo-detainee.php">blocked the release</a> [JURIST report] of Guantanamo detainee Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman by <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/727BF5F867C51399852578620051FD30/$file/10-5235-1300403.pdf">overturning</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court decision that claimed the government had failed to prove prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Uthman had received and executed orders from al Qaeda. In September, Kuwaiti Guantanamo detainee Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad al Odah <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Al-Odah-cert-petition-9-28-10.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guantanamo-detainee-appeals-to-supreme-court-for-habeas-relief.php">report</a>] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reverse a federal appeals court decision that denied him <em>habeas corpus</em> relief. The DC appeals court <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201007/09-5331-1253722.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-denies-guantanamo-detainee-al-odahs-habeas-petition.php">report</a>] <em>habeas corpus</em> relief to al Odah in July. The court affirmed the district court's <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2002cv0828-639">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/federal-judge-denies-al-odah-guantanamo.php">report</a>] that there was sufficient evidence against al Odah for him to be considered "part of" al Qaeda and Taliban forces. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Recent concerns follow <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) claims that Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] ordered <a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/90050948?International%20Criminal%20Court%20%28ICC%29%20claims%20Gaddafi%20use%20rape%20as%20weapon%20of%20war%20and%20repression">mass rapes</a> [AHN report] against his rebel opposition. Additionally, the ICC claims that they posses evidence that Gaddafi supplied his troops with contraceptives and Viagra to promote rape and help execute these orders. The Libyan government <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=13799393">denies use of rape as a weapon</a> [AP report], but the investigation of these alleged crimes will determine whether the ICC will charge Gaddafi for war crimes. The UN's concern also rises over the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/12/48-women-raped-hour-congo">staggering numbers of women raped</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1076399.stm">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Democratic+republic+of+Congo">news archive</a>] where sexual violence is popularly known to be used as a weapon of war. In response to the sexual violence occurring in many conflict nations, UN officials are in the process of creating a blacklist of nations using rape as a weapon in hopes to subject them to sanctions. 

<p>Punishment has been sought for several leaders of war-torn nations that have used sexual violence in war.  Rape became a major focus for charging Gaddafi with crimes against humanity when victim Emen Al Obeidi became internationally known when she entered the Rixos Hotel on March 26 and told the international press corps that she had been stopped at a checkpoint by Gaddafi's  forces and beaten and gang-raped for 2 days. Last week the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website] publicly <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-denounces-qatar-extradition-of-libya-rape-victim.php"> condemned her extradition back to Libya</a> [JURIST report] because of fear for her protection. In April, <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] requested an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] of Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara for crimes including murder and rape, committed by opposing political forces during recent conflicts. In March, a military court in the DRC  <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/drc-military-court-jails-army-officers-for-rape.php">sentenced 11 army officers to prison</a> [JURIST report] for raping more than 20 women last year. UN officials viewed this arrest as a strong sign that justice for these types of crimes is possible. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/election/241568/abhisit-opposes-referendum-plan">referendum was proposed</a> [<em>Bangkok Post</em> report] by the Pheu Thai Party, supporters of former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=thaksin">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [JURIST news archive], who was ousted in the coup.

<p>Thailand's political system has remained unstable following the coup and the more recent violent protests took place in Bangkok last spring.

The <a href="http://www.senado.gov.co/sala-de-prensa/noticias/item/11798-abc-de-la-ley-de-victimas-informe-especial">Victims' and Land Restitution Law</a> [Senate backgrounder, in Spanish], <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/05/colombia-senate-passes-victim-compensation-law.php">approved by the Senate</a> [JURIST report] last month, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13736523">seeks to compensate</a> [BBC report] millions of individuals by providing damages to relatives of those killed during the armed conflict, which has spanned over 40 years. The law will also help to return land stolen throughout the conflict to its rightful owners. Implementing the law will be challenging due to the estimated cost involved, but the UN has pledged to lend its support to Colombia. In a <a href="http://wsp.presidencia.gov.co/Prensa/2011/Junio/Paginas/20110610_07.aspx">speech</a> [text, in Spanish], Santos emphasized the importance of the Victims' Law: <blockquote>In short: it is a broad and comprehensive law which is a monumental effort, no doubt, the State and society to compensate our victims and heal the wounds we have suffered as a nation. ... May God give us strength, and the Colombians and the world give us their support, to make this law now sanctioned an instrument of peace and justice.</blockquote>Victims of war crimes and their families often go uncompensated. However, the passage of this law, in conjunction with recent court decisions, marks a possible reversal to this trend. 

<p>The US federal court system has heard several lawsuits seeking compensation for victims of Colombian violence. In February, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/eleventh-circuit-revives-colombia-wrongful-death-suit-against-alabama-company.php">revived a wrongful death lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought against <a href="http://www.drummondco.com/">Drummond Company</a> [corporate website]. The plaintiffs alleged that, after Drummond employees in Colombia successfully unionized, the company hired the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/colombia/farc-eln-colombias-left-wing-guerrillas/p9272">United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia</a> (AUC) [CFR backgrounder], a group of paramilitaries, to break up the union and murder its leaders, plaintiff's fathers. In April 2010, victims of paramilitary violence in Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/chiquita-sued-in-us-court-for-aiding.php">filed suit against Chiquita Brand International</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a>. The plaintiffs were 242 Colombians who alleged that they had been seriously injured or had family members killed by the AUC, which received funding from Chiquita. In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/chiquita-to-pay-25m-to-settle-terrorism.php">Chiquita was fined $25 million</a> [JURIST report] after it admitted to making payments of around $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to the AUC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the death of Mohammed was a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13739567">significant blow</a> [BBC report] to al Qaeda. 

<p>The 1998 Embassy bombings killed more than 200 people including 12 Americans, and Mohammed has been a fugitive ever since then. Before the Embassy bombings, Mohammed trained militants in Somalia and later planned attacks against Israeli tourists in Kenya. There was a $5 million reward for Mohammed, who was the most sought after individual in Africa.

AI cited a disturbing increase in executions in 2011, which they claim often rely solely on the basis of confessions obtained under duress or deception. According to AI, in 2011, at least 27 people have already been executed, equal to the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/saudi-arabia/report-2011#ai-reports">total sum of executions in 2010</a> [AI report]. Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said AI is aware of more than 100 people on death row, many of whom are foreign nationals. Saudi Arabia applies the death penalty to violent, as well as non-violent crimes, such as sorcery and apostasy.  

<p>In 2008, AI released a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/saudi-execution-rate-connected-to.php">report</a> finding that Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-1200-people-executed-worldwide-in.php">executed more people per capita than any other nation</a> [JURIST reports]. According to that report, at least 1,252 people were put to death in 24 countries, with Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, Pakistan and the US accounting for the vast majority of the executions. In July of that year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/saudi-arabia-urged-to-improve-domestic.php">criticizing a lack of legal protections</a> [JURIST report] for the 1.5 million migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia.

The <a href="http://www.worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index/">Rule of Law Index</a> (RLI) [report backgrounder] is a tool by which the international legal community evaluates whether government officials are held accountable under the law, whether the laws are clear and protect fundamental rights, whether the laws afford due process to citizens, and whether adjudicators and representatives have the resources to adequately administer justice. Countries in Western Europe and North America received the highest ranks in most categories, but showed weakness with respect to discrimination and accessibility of the civil justice system, especially for marginalized groups. Several Latin American and Caribbean nations displayed strength in government accountability and openness, but crime remains rampant and governments inefficient. Similarly, Eastern European countries are dichotomized, with some countries leading in accountability and transparency and others trailing with respect to treatment of prisoners and enforcement of the rule of law. New Zealand ranked highest out of the East Asian and Pacific nations category; Cambodia ranked lowest. African nations generally had the lowest rankings in most categories.

<p>A survey released by the <a href="http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en">Mo Ibrahim Foundation</a> [advocacy website] in October 2010 detailed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/africa-survey-sees-decline-in-rights-rule-of-law-despite-economic-advancements.php">decline in the rule of law</a> [JURIST report] and democratic rights amongst African nations. In November 2010, Mexican <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Felipe Calderon</a> [official website, in Spanish] called for greater adherence to the rule of law, <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/mexico-president-calls-for-stronger.php">stressing</a> [JURIST report] its importance for a flourishing economy and orderly social life.

On Friday, several <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/pakistan-high-court-demands-explanation-of-security-force-killing.php">paramilitary soldiers opened fire</a> [JURIST report] on an unarmed, 17-year-old man in Benazir Park, then stood by as he died. The incident was caught on tape and disseminated by television and Internet media sources. Chairwoman of the <a href="http://www.hrcp-web.org/default.asp">Pakistan Human Rights Commission</a> (PHRC) [advocacy website] Zohra Yusuf said the video footage clearly shows that <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/13/pakistan.shooting/">Sarfraz Shah was unarmed</a> [CNN report]. Pakistani <a href="http://www.rehmanmalik.com/">Interior Minister Rehman Malik</a> [official website] acknowledged that the killing was unjust, but pointed out that Shah had been trying to rob two women in the park. Malik further noted that the proceedings would be transparent and neutral. Anti-Terrorist Courts in Pakistan facilitate expedited hearings and decisions.

<p>Human rights groups have expressed concern over Pakistan's human rights record. In April, the PHRC <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/pakistan-criticized-for-human-rights-violations.php">harshly criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Pakistani government for its poor human rights record and called on government officials to fix the human rights abuses occurring in the country. In its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrcp-web.org/Publications/AR2010.pdf">2010 Annual Report</a> [text, PDF], the group chronicled the repeated human rights violations that have taken place in the country over the past year, citing growing intolerance and extremism in the country. The government was also blamed for its inability to reform <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blasphemy">blasphemy laws</a> and abolish the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abolish+death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archives]. Also in April, the US <a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-state-department-releases-2010-annual-rights-reports.php">released</a> [JURIST report] the 2010 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/index.htm">Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [materials], criticizing the governments of Afghanistan and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154485.htm">Pakistan</a> [materials] for their conduct in the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda. However, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/pakistan-lawmakers-elect-bhutto-widower.php">2008 Pakistani elections</a> [JURIST report] were deemed "competitive and reflective of the people's will," restoring democratic rule and leading to some human rights progress.

Controversy surrounding Pakistan's blasphemy law has recently been reignited over the case of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muhammad">Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive] during an argument with other women in her village last year.

<p>Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12903507">underwent a transfer of power</a> [BBC report] from a military regime to a civil system after holding its first elections in 20 years. But many critics argue the new regime is a sham since a party close to the military regime won with 80 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Last month, Myanmar began releasing as many as 15,000 prisoners as part of an amnesty program after a visit by the UN secretary-general's envoy to Myanmar, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=117">Vijay Nambiar</a> [official profile], who called on the country to release its political prisoners. But few of the prisoners being released by the government are political prisoners. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/home">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] called the move a "pathetic response" to calls from the international community. Last December, a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] expert <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tomas+ojea+quintana">news archive</a>], a UN Special Rapporteur, <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/un-rights-expert-urges-release-of-myanmar-political-prisoners.php">urged Myanmar's military government</a> [JURIST report] to release 2,202 political prisoners. Quintana called for the release of the "prisoners of conscience," many of whom, he says, suffer from health problems as a result of the harsh detention conditions. Quintana claims the release is necessary to promote democracy. Last November, Myanmar's government released Suu Kyi, ending her almost eight years under house arrest. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] hailed her release and encouraged the country to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=4924">release all political prisoners</a> [press release]. Suu Kyi's release came days after the Myanmar Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-high-courts-rejects-suu-kyi-appeal.php">rejected an appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging the conditions of her house arrest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-considers-railroad-tax-gender-discrimination-cases.php">report</a>] upholding a gender-based distinction in two former sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the decision, and the court split 4-4, resulting in the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2008/08/06/0750445.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] being upheld. Petitioner Ruben Flores-Villar had raised a Fifth Amendment equal protection challenge of the two INA provisions, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1401.html">8 USC &#167; 1401(a)(7)</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1409.html">8 USC &#167; 1409</a> [texts], which impose a five-year residence requirement, after the age of 14, on US citizen fathers, but not on US citizen mothers, before they may transmit citizenship to a child born out of wedlock abroad to a non-citizen. The court affirmed Flores-Villar's conviction for being a deported alien found in the US.

<p>The Supreme Court also <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/061311zor.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] Monday in four cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-875.htm">Hall v. United States</a> [docket], the petitioners filed for bankruptcy under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_11_10_12.html">Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code</a> [11 USC &#167;&#167; 1201-1231] and subsequently sold their farm for $960,000, incurring a $29,000 capital gains federal income tax. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/08/16/08-17267.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that petitioners had to pay federal income tax on the gain from the sale of their farm during bankruptcy proceedings. Petitioners argue that the tax should be discharged pursuant to &#167; 1222 of the Bankruptcy Code as a post-petition expense of the bankruptcy estate.</p>

<p>The court granted a limited petition in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-895.htm">Gonzalez v. Thaler</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Brief-03-30-11-124740.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether there was jurisdiction to issue a certificate of appealability under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002253----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 2253(c)</a> [text] and adjudicate the petitioner's appeal, and whether the application for a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> was out of time under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00002244----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 2244(d)(1)</a> [text] due to "the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review." The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/08/08-10871-CV0.wpd.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Gonzalez's petition was time-barred by the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/antiterrorism_and_effective_death_penalty_act_of_1996_aedpa">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a> (AEDPA) [materials], which establishes a one-year statute of limitations for a state prisoner to file a federal <em>habeas corpus</em> petition. The court will determine whether state or federal definitions apply to Gonzalez's appeal. </p>

<p>The court will also determine whether an appeals court properly <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/08/08-10835-CR0.wpd.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] a prison sentence imposed by a district court in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-7387.htm">Setser v. United States</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Monroe-Ace-Setser_Petition-for-Writ-of-Certiorari.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the district court did not err in imposing a consecutive sentence to be added to the sentence the appellant was already serving for a state drug possession conviction. Setser argues that the district court's sentence was illegal since <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00003584----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 3584</a> [text] does not grant the district court the authority to impose a federal sentence consecutively to an undischarged state sentence.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-8145.htm">Smith v. Louisiana</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Smith-v.-Louisiana-Cert.-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether a Louisiana state court failed to address due process violations present in the petitioner's case. Juan Smith, the petitioner, was convicted on five counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Smith's petition for review was denied by the <a href="http://www.lasc.org/">Supreme Court of Louisiana</a> [official website]. The petitioner argues that violations of prior case law, including <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/373/83/case.html">Brady v. Maryland</a>, <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=405&invol=150">Giglio v. United States</a> and <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/360/264/case.html">Napue v.

Jicarilla Apache Nation</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that in a trust relationship between the government and a Native American tribe the government does not have to release confidential communications with its attorney under the "fiduciary exception" to attorney-client privilege. The <a href="http://www.jicarillaonline.com/">Jicarilla Apache Nation</a> [official website] attempted to compel through discovery certain documents to prove its breach of trust action against the government, but the government argued that some of the documents were protected by attorney-client privilege. The Supreme Court ruled 7-1, overturning the lower 
appeals court, that the government was entitled to protection under attorney-client privilege despite is position as trustee for the benefit of the tribe. The tribe argued that the common-law "fiduciary exception" should apply, which makes communications between the trustee and the attorney over management of the trust corpus discoverable by the beneficiaries. The opinion of the court by Justice Samuel Alito reasoned that the government acting as a trustee is unlike a trustee in a private trust created at common law because the government is acting within statutory authority granted to it by Congress. The fiduciary exception is based on the idea that the trustee is acting on behalf of the "real client" the beneficiaries. The communication between the government and its attorneys over management of this trust however, is based on the government's sovereign interest to carry out federal law, and not solely for the benefit of the tribe. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the lone dissent arguing that the government is fulfilling the traditional fiduciary role as a trustee for the benefit of the tribe. Further she argued that the exception should exist since Rule 501 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rules.htm">Federal Rules of Evidence</a> [text] says that the government's privilege is to be informed by the common law. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the decision. 

<p>The Jicarilla Apache Nation reservation contains natural resources that are developed by the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> [official website] with the proceeds held by the US in trust for the tribe. The tribe brought a claim against the government for breach of trust seeking monetary damages for mismanagement of trust funds. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-attorney-client-privilege.php">tribe had argued</a> [JURIST report] that no trustee in such a situation should be entitled to hide behind the privilege, that the beneficiary of a trustee should be entitled to see the communications of the trustee with an attorney over the management of the trust to see if the trustee actually followed that advice. The Supreme Court overturned the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/09-M908.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the government cannot deny the tribe's request to discover such communications, adopting a fiduciary exception in tribal trust cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

First Derivative Traders</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-considers-securities-fraud-employment-discrimination-cases.php">report</a>] that a service provider cannot be held primarily liable in a private securities fraud suit for aiding and participating in another company's misstatements. Section 10(b) of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_exchange_act_of_1934">Securities and Exchange Act</a> [materials] prohibits any manipulation or deception in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. The liability associated with the act, according to the court, does not extend to service providers that aided in the selling of securities where misinformation was involved. Janus Investment Fund, a separate legal entity from Janus Capital Group (JCG), issued prospectuses containing misleading statements about measures to curb market timing. First Derivative Traders investors owning JCG stocks sued JCG for reliance damages. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, pointing out that JCG had not "made" any misleading statements. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, agreed with the district court:<blockquote>For purposes of Rule 10b-5, the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it. Without control, a person or entity can merely suggest what to say, not "make" a statement in its own right. One who prepares or publishes a statement on behalf of another is not its maker.</blockquote>The ruling reverses a <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/071607.P.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF].

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissent expressing his disagreement with the majority's interpretation of the word "make." Breyer argued that the majority restricted liability for "making" misrepresentations to those individuals with "ultimate authority" over the statement, or in this case, the board members. He indicated that "[n]othing in the English language prevents one from saying that several different individuals, separately or together, 'make' a statement that each has a hand in producing." Furthermore, Breyer argues, the relationship between JCG and Janus Investment Fund is so close that Janus Investment Fund's involvement in making the statements "could hardly have been greater."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Carrigan</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that a Nevada ethics law that requiring government officials to recuse themselves from votes where they have a conflict of interest is constitutional. The <a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-281A.html#NRS281ASec420">Nevada Ethics in Government Law</a> [text] requires government officials to recuse themselves from a vote where the person in the situation would be "materially affected" by "[t]he public officer's commitment in a private capacity to the interests of others." The opinion of the court by Justice Antonin Scalia said public officials' votes are not protected by the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech:<blockquote>The answer is that a legislator's vote is the commitment of his apportioned share of the legislature's power to the passage or defeat of a particular proposal. The legislative power thus committed is not personal to the legislator but belongs to the people; the legislator has no personal right to it. ... the legislator casts his vote as trustee for his constituents, not as a prerogative of personal power. In this respect, voting by a legislator is different from voting by a citizen. While a voter's franchise is a personal right, the procedures for voting in legislative assemblies ... pertain to legislators not as individuals but as political representatives executing the legislative process.</blockquote> The court also reasoned that since there were similar recusal rules at the time the Constitution was written that it was never intended to be a protected form of speech. The court rejected the argument that the Nevada law was overbroad because it also prevented the official from advocating for other officials to vote a certain way where that official had a conflict of interest reasoning that if the voting is not constitutionally protected speech, then preventing advocating was a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction. Justice Samuel Alito concurred in part and in the judgment arguing that a public official's vote was a form of speech but agreed it was not meant to be protected because such rules were accepted at the Constitution's inception. 

<p>The Supreme Court ruling overturns the decision of the Nevada Supreme Court which, citing <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/citizens-opinion.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>], <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/01-07-Nevada-Commission-opinion-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that preventing an official from casting such a vote violates the First Amendment because voting by an elected public officer on public issues is protected speech. City Councilman Michael Carrigan, an elected local official in Nevada, voted to approve a hotel and casino project that had used his campaign manager and friend as a paid consultant. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Nearly 1,200 people have been killed and 10,000 displaced since protests erupted in February. UN Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href="http://www.unocha.org/about-us/headofOCHA">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] <a href="http://ochanet.unocha.org/p/Documents/Statement%20on%20Syria%2013%20June%202011.pdf">urged</a> [statement] the Syrian government to investigate the killings and praised border nations for their assistance:<blockquote>I call on the Government to respect and protect civilians, and to refrain from the use of force against peaceful demonstrators. It is important that we find out exactly what is happening in Syria so that we can provide help if required. I hope that the Government of Syria will allow an independent assessment to be conducted. I commend the neighbouring states for keeping their borders open and appreciate the assistance they have given. I underscore the readiness of the United Nations to help with this in any way necessary, particularly in light of the recent increase in the numbers of new arrivals.</blockquote> Thousands of Syrians <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/06/13/137153318/thousands-more-syrians-seek-to-enter-turkey">gathered at the Turkish border</a> [NPR report] on Monday seeking refuge from Syrian military forces that continue to use violence against peaceful protestors. 

<p>There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. In June, Syrian and international human rights groups urged the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the hundreds of civilian deaths during protests against Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], in an emergency special session in April, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4dbfe77d2.pdf">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">report</a>] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">called for Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also in April, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued. Earlier in the same month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">stopped medical personnel</a> [JURIST report], sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] in March to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence.

Al-Bashir is scheduled to participate in the <a href="http://lid2011.kln.gov.my/">Langkawi International Dialogue</a> [official website], hosted by Malaysia later this month. The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">issued a warrant</a> for al-Bashir's arrest in 2009 for war crimes, and later <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">charged him with genocide</a> [JURIST reports]. Malaysia is not currently a party to the ICC's <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/english/rome_statute%28e%29.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], and therefore has no obligation to the international community to arrest al-Bashir. However, Malaysia indicated in March that it intended to become a party state, and, as Donna Guest, Deputy Asia Pacific Director at Amnesty International said, "Malaysia's invitation to Omar al-Bashir  flies in the face of its decision to join the ICC."

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a>, the Chief Prosecutor of the ICC said that al-Bashir has <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/6D41CBD9-6EE2-4412-BC6F-94D2D088AD5D/283421/StatementICCProsecutortotheUNSecurityCouncilonthes.pdf">continued to commit crimes against humanity</a> [statement, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-prosecutor-sudan-president-continues-crimes-against-humanity.php">report</a>] in <a href="/currentawareness/darfur.php">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive]. Several countries have been reported for failing to arrest al-Bashir while he has been present inside their borders. In May, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">urged Djibouti to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. In October, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">ICC requested that Kenya arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] while he visited that year for a second time. Previously, al-Bashir had visited Kenya for the signing of the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Following his visit, the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc930979.pdf">reported Kenya</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">report</a>] to the UN Security Council and the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute for the violation in not arresting al-Bashir. Also following his August visit, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Kenya to reaffirm its cooperation with the ICC by <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/annan-questions-kenyas-icc-commitment-after-al-bashir-visit.php">arresting al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. In July, the ICC called for al-Bashir's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-al-bashir-will-be-arrested.php">arrest during his visit to Chad</a> [JURIST report], marking the first visit to an ICC member state since the warrants were issued. The ICC also <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc931075.pdf">reported Chad</a> [decision, PDF] to the Security Council and Assembly of States Parties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Erdogan recently <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-12/early-election-results-from-turkey-show-erdogan-likely-to-win-third-term.html">won his third consecutive term</a> [Bloomberg report] in parliamentary elections, but his <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [official website] <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/06/201161312337875876.html">failed to win a majority</a> [Al Jazeera report] of seats in parliament, leaving the AKP without power to draft a constitution on its own. During his victory speech in Ankara, the country's capital, and throughout his campaign, Erdogan asserted that a new constitution is necessary to promote democracy and ensure human rights. Turkey's current constitution was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13749191">drafted by a military government</a> [BBC report] 30 years ago. Some groups have chastised Erdogan for failing to carry out his promises to ease tension between the Kurdish minority and the government, reform the judiciary and reduce unemployment.

<p>Constitutional reforms are an issue for Turkey's accession to the <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] since its constitution was written under military rule and limits freedom of expression and religion.

The CCR filed the appeal in the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/content/home+page">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on behalf of the two men's families to renew the civil lawsuit against the US and 24 government officials, including former US defense secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive], claiming they are responsible for arbitrary detention, torture, and the death of Al-Zahrani and Al-Salami. US military officials said the two men <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-three-guantanamo.php">committed suicide</a> [JURIST report] in June 2006 while in detention. Al-Zahrani was said to have <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/military-officials-say-guantanamo.php">hung himself</a> [JURIST report] with his bed sheets and clothing. A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia District</a> [official website] granted the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-dismisses-guantanamo.php">defendants' motion for dismissal</a> early last year and later <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-denies-rehearing-guantanamo-wrongful-death-suit.php">denied a motion for reconsideration</a> [JURIST reports] filed after new evidence of eye witness accounts from soldiers suggested the men died while being tortured. The CCR claims that these reports show a high-level cover-up and that the soldiers were ordered not to speak out. 

<p>The judge denied the reconsideration despite the new evidence saying it does not change the reasoning for dismissal that the "special needs of foreign affairs must stay" the court's action. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rumsfeld-sued-for-wrongful-death-of.php">claim was originally brought</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Claims Act</a> [text], which provides that district courts have original jurisdiction to hear claims for torts "committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." The defendants moved to dismiss the suit based on &#167; 7 of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ366.109.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF], which removes the ability of federal courts to hear challenges to the treatment of aliens who have been "properly detained" as enemy combatants. In 2008, officials from the <a href="http://www.ncis.navy.mil/index.asp">Naval Criminal Investigative Service</a> [official website] said notes found in the clothes of two detainees indicated that they were seeking martyrdom. Military investigations of the suicides <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/pentagon-says-no-need-for-independent.php">began</a> [JURIST report] immediately after the men were found in their cells, and the military quickly rejected calls for independent civilian investigations. The military similarly rejected requests by the governments of <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/yemen-calls-for-probe-into-guantanamo.php">Yemen</a> and <a href="paperchase/2006/06/guantanamo-suicides-spark-renewed.php">Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST reports] to reform the investigation process. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/TX%20Complaint%20FIN.pdf">challenge</a> [complaint, PDF] Monday to the newly signed Texas law requiring a sonogram be done before a woman can have an abortion. The CRR filed the lawsuit in the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] on behalf of a class of physicians who perform abortions claiming that the act is unconstitutional because it "profoundly intrudes on the practice of medicine, forces physicians to deliver ideological speech to patients, and treats women as less than fully competent adults." The complaint outlined the ways in which the act intrudes on medical practice:<blockquote>The Act imposes strict liability, criminal penalties, and a mandatory penalty of the non-renewal of a medical license on any physician who fails to comply with any one of myriad requirements for providing government-mandated information to a patient in advance of an abortion. The Act imposes numerous requirements that are contrary to standard medical practice and/or violate standards of medical ethics. For example, the Act will compel physicians to deliver to their patients government-mandated speech including visual and auditory depictions of the fetus that falls outside the accepted standards and practices for medical informed consent. Moreover, given its harsh penalties and vague requirements, the Act will force physicians to deliver this government-mandated speech even where a patient declines to receive it, or else risk losing his or her license.</blockquote>The lawsuit argues that by forcing the physician to deliver government-mandated materials to the patient, it violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] rights of both the patient and of the physician. It forces patients to hear what CRR claims is politically-motivated speech before making a decision and forces physicians to deliver unwanted information. The complaint further argues that the law violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder] "by subjecting women to burdens not imposed on men; by perpetuating patronizing and paternalistic stereotypes of women as in need of special 'protections' and unable to make medical decisions on their own; and by enforcing the notion that a woman's primary and proper role is that of mother." 

<p>Last month, Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/HB00015E.pdf#navpanes=0">bill</a> [HB 15 text; <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=HB15">materials</a>] requiring doctors to conduct a vaginal ultrasound and display the images at least 24 hours prior to an abortion, and stripping them of their medical licenses should they fail to do so. The law also requires doctors to provide "a simultaneous verbal explanation of the results of the live, real-time sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of arms, legs, external members, and internal organs." The Texas law is one of a number of state laws passed recently attempting to restrict abortion rights. Earlier this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">Iowa House passed</a> [JURIST report] what would be the most restrictive law yet, effectively banning abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084138p1.pdf">JS v. Blue Mountain School District</a> [opinion, PDF], a female middle school student created, on her own computer, a MySpace profile mocking the school principal. The principal suspended the student for 10 days, and the student initiated a civil rights suit against the principal and school district. The US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/JSDistCtdecision.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of the school district, holding that the school's punishing the student did not violate the student's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First Amendment</a> [text] right to free speech. The <em>en banc</em> appeals court overruled, holding that, pursuant to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0393_0503_ZO.html">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a> [opinion], the school officials failed to demonstrate that the student's behavior "materially and substantially interfere[d] with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school" such that punishment of her expression of opinion was justified. Though the profile contained lewd and vulgar language, it was not created on the school campus, did not disrupt the school day, nor was disruption reasonably foreseeable. The appeals court did, however, agree with the district court's granting of summary judgment against the student with respect to her parents' Fourteenth Amendment right to raise their children, and that the school handbook was not unconstitutionally vague. The dissenters contend that the ruling undermines the school's discretion to regulate student behavior. The <em>en banc</em> Third Circuit Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion in <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/074465p1.pdf">Layshock v. Hermitage School District</a> [opinion, PDF]. Layshock also used a personal computer to create a profile of his school principal. The appeals court affirmed the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/LayshockOrder.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in favor of the student on the basis that the school violated his First Amendment right.

<p>The Supreme Court has addressed freedom of speech in schools most recently in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2006/morvfre">Morse v. Frederick</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in.php">report</a>]. In June 2007, the Court <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/06-278.ZO.html">held</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/supreme-court-rules-in-student-free.php">report</a>] that public schools do not violate the First Amendment rights of students by punishing them for speech during a school-sanctioned activity that may be reasonably interpreted to promote the use of illegal substances. A high school student was suspended after he displayed a banner with the message "Bong hits 4 Jesus" during a televised parade on a school day. The Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2006/03/09/0335701.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] and held that the "First Amendment does not require schools to tolerate at school events student expression that contributes" to the danger of illegal drug use. The Supreme Court has not ruled on a case related to student speech created outside of the classroom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Vasilyeva brought with her <a href="http://www.echo.msk.ru/blog/echomsk/784249-echo/">documents</a> [text, in Russian] which allegedly show Judge Viktor Danklin's original proposed ruling being crossed out and replaced with the ruling handed down by his superiors. After the questioning, the Committee found there was no evidence of abuse of process. The Committee said that Vasilyeva's claims were <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/06/14/general-eu-russia-khodorkovsky_8515403.html">not supported by objective evidence</a> [AP report]. Last February, Vasilyeva gave an interview to <a href="http://gazeta.ru/">Gazeta.ru website</a> [official website] alleging that Danilkin did not write the verdict and was coerced into reading it. Earlier this month, Khodorkovsky <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Khodorkovsky-reissues-parole-request-after-court-refused-it-for-insufficient-documentation.php">reissued his appeal for release on parole</a> [JURIST report] after the first attempt was returned due to insufficient documentation. Khodorkovsky has served half of a 13-year sentence, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/russia-appeals-court-upholds-khodorkovsky-conviction-reduces-sentence.php">reduced by a year</a> [JURIST report] last month, for fraud, theft and money laundering, which under Russian law makes him eligible for parole.

<p>According to Vasilyeva, Danilkin, a judge for the <a href="http://hamovnichesky.msk.sudrf.ru/">Khamovnichesky District Court</a> [official website, in Russian], was pressured and coached by officials from the Moscow City Court. "When something happened, when something went wrong, he had a duty to provide information to the Moscow City Court and, accordingly, received certain instructions on how to behave," she said. At the end of the trial, Danilkin wrote a verdict, but Vasilyeva said it probably "did not satisfy the higher ups" and he was therefore given a different verdict, which he was ordered to issue. Danilkin responded to Vasilyeva's comments calling them <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2308757.html">slander</a> [RFE/RL report]. In December, Danilkin <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Khodorkovsky and his business partner, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=platon+lebedev">news archive</a>], to six additional years in prison, extending their imprisonment to a total of 14 years. Their defense counsel staunchly criticized the ruling, <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-denfense-team-statement-verdict">claiming</a> [press release] that the court blocked significant amounts of testimony and evidence submitted by the defense and systematically quashed objections to their omission. The verdict drew vehement <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/international-community-critical-of-khodorkovsky-verdict.php">international criticism</a> [JURIST report], including from US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile], who <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/12/153716.htm">said</a> [press release] that the ruling "raises serious questions about selective prosecution."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Both companies agreed to withdraw all complaints filed with the US <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) [official website] and end 46 ongoing patent infringement disputes in various countries around the world. Nokia's statement indicated that the agreement would have a positive financial impact on Nokia's prospectus for the second quarter of 2011. Analysts indicated that, following its recent victory, Nokia would <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/business/2011/06/20116148184938474.html">likely target Google Android phone developers</a> [Al Jazeera report] next.

<p>Nokia and Apple have been embroiled in litigation marked by trading accusations of patent infringement. Nokia announced in March that it <a href="http://press.nokia.com/2011/03/29/nokia-files-second-itc-complaint-against-apple/">filed another complaint</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/nokia-files-new-round-of-patent-suits-against-apple.php">report</a>] against Apple with the ITC in addition to a lawsuit filed in Delaware.

Apple counter-sued last December, claiming Nokia had stolen 13 patents from the company.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court decided to allow broadcast coverage in this particular situation involving the trial of several members of a clan accused of killing 57 people, including 31 journalists, supporting a rival political candidate. But the court's guidelines could pose problems for potential broadcasters. The court will not allow broadcasters to bring in their own cameras, but will instead provide a single, stationary, widescreen camera. No panning or zooming in will be allowed and broadcasters will have to show the entire proceedings from beginning to end each day commercial free. There is also not allowed to be any voiceovers during the proceedings nor will repeat airings be allowed until after the final judgment. The <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/index.php?id1=1">Philippines Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] had implicated Andal Ampatuan Sr., the leader of a Muslim clan in the Philippines' semi-autonomous southern province of Maguindanao, and several of his followers in the November 2009 slayings of campaign workers, journalists and supporters of family political rival Esmael Mangudadatu. The court noted that broadcasting the trial was important because of the impossibility of fitting the large number of interested parties into the courtroom, including the families of those killed and of the witnesses.  

<p>Earlier this month, a Philippine court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/philippines-court-freezes-23-million-assets-of-massacre-suspects.php">froze USD $23 million worth of assets</a> [JURIST report] owned by the Ampatuan family, who are accused of ordering the 2009 slayings, while investigators determine how the Ampatuans accumulated accumulated the assets. In March, a Quezon City court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-clan-leader-cleared-of.php">dismissed rebellion charges</a> [JURIST report] against 24 people, including Ampatuan Sr. Days earlier, a court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/philippines-court-orders-arrest-of-189.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for 189 suspects. The PDOJ had already <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-prosecutors-charge-197-for.php">charged 197 people with murder</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the November 2009 killings. In December 2009, the PDOJ <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/philippines-prosecutors-begin-rebellion.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of more than 600 people charged with rebellion for allegedly interfering with government operations following the killings. Several of Amapuan Sr.'s sons, including Andal Ampatuan Jr., the mayor of the southern Philippine town of Datu Unsay, have also been charged. Amapuan Jr. has <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/philippines-mayor-pleads-not-guilty-to.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 41 counts of murder. The Ampatuans and several of their followers are alleged to have intercepted Mangudadatu's convoy en route to declare his candidacy for governor at a regional election office, ultimately forcing his convoy to a remote hilltop where the Ampatuans' group killed and buried them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court found that the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/14/russia-acquits-activist-slander-chechnya">allegations were hypothetical</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and thus, did not constitute libel. Kadryov brought the charges against Orlov, leader of the <a href="http://www.memo.ru/">Memorial</a> [advocacy website, in Russian] human rights group, after Memorial <a href="http://www.memo.ru/2009/07/15/1507093.htm">accused</a> [press release, in Russian] Kadryov of being responsible for the murder of Chechen rights activist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8152648.stm">Natalia Estemirova</a> [BBC obituary]. She was kidnapped and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/russia-human-rights-advocate-estemirova.php">shot to death</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009. Estemirova was Memorial's representative in Chechnya, and the group has also accused Kadryov of extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, torture and other crimes. Orlov said the decision showed law had won out over politics. He had maintained that the charges were politically motivated. He was facing a potential maximum sentence of three years in prison. 

<p>Orlov has been critical of the Russian government. In February 2010, he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/russia-rights-activists-detained-in.php">arrested along with as many as 100 anti-Kremlin demonstrators</a> [JURIST report] as they protested against the perceived government curtailing of the right to peaceful assembly. The 300-strong group chanted slogans calling for <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=putin">news archive</a>] to step aside. Kadryov <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/chechnya-president-files-criminal-libel.php">filed the libel charges</a> [JURIST report] against Orlov in October 2009 after Orlov had already lost a civil suit brought by Kadyrov resulting in USD $2,300 in fines and an order to remove his accusation from Memorial's website. The charges came less than a week after Orlov won the prestigious <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=en&id=42">Sakharov Award</a> from the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> [official websites] for his work with Memorial. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A legally married same-sex couple filed a joint petition under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/11/usc_sec_11_00001301----000-.html">Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code</a> [11 USC &#167; 1301 text] pursuant to &#167; 302(a) which permits the filing of a joint petition by any eligible individual "and such individual debtor's spouse." DOMA defines "spouse" for purposes of federal law as "a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife." The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ust/">US Trustees</a> [official website] moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the two males were ineligible to file the petition jointly. The couple challenged DOMA on due process and equal protection grounds as established under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">Fifth Amendment</a> [text]. The court used a "heightened scrutiny" standard to invalidate the federal statute, but also indicated that DOMA fails rational basis review:<blockquote>[T]his court concludes that DOMA is gender-biased because it is explicitly designed to deprive the Debtors of the benefits of other important federal law solely on the basis that these debtors are two people married to each other who happen to be men. Further, nothing about the Debtors' gender affects their fitness for bankruptcy protection available to opposite-sex marital partners. Spouses should be treated equally, whether of the opposite-sex variety or the same-sex variety, under heightened scrutiny and the principles announced by the Supreme Court and other lower court rulings discussed above.</blockquote>Twenty bankruptcy judges from the central district of California signed the opinion holding that "no legally married couple should be entitled to fewer bankruptcy rights than any other legally married couple."

<p>Congressional Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">legislation</a> [text] in March to repeal DOMA after House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">Speaker John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/house-speaker-boehner-launches-doma-defense-group.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he is launching a <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=227399">legal advisory group to defend</a> [press release] DOMA. Boehner's proposal came in response to a US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">declaration</a> [JURIST report] that it would <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/February/11-ag-222.html">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [press release] of Section 3 of DOMA, which defines marriage for federal purposes as a legal union between one man and one woman, in court cases challenging the provision. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] acknowledged that the announcement marks a change in policy for the DOJ and the Obama administration, but noted that the change was necessary due to cases pending in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Holder explained that when the DOJ previously defended DOMA it had done so in jurisdictions with binding precedent stating that a permissive standard of review was applicable to laws dealing with sexual orientation. The announcement came just one month after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA. The appeal followed a July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause under the Fifth Amendment and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled 8-1 that HB 1804's denial of bail to illegal immigrants charged with felonies or for driving under the influence was unconstitutional because it infringed on the authority of the trial judge. One judge dissented arguing that HB 1804 was entirely constitutional. What was <a href="http://www.newsok.com/oklahomas-high-court-upholds-states-anti-illegal-immigration-bill/article/3577093?custom_click=pod_headline_crime">validated</a> [<em>The Oklahoman</em> report] were provisions authorizing law enforcement to use concurrent authority with the federal government to control illegal immigration, to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving drivers' licenses or state-issued ID cards, making illegal immigrants inelligible for state assistance, and requiring employers to check the immigration status of its employees. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/oklahoma-immigration-law-facing-new.php">challenge was brought</a> [JURIST report] by Michael Thomas who argued that HB 1804 unconstitutionally delegates authority to the federal government and unconstitutionally appropriates money for the establishment of a department of immigration. But the court concluded that HB 1804 merely cooperates with federal authority and that HB 1804 does not attempt to regulate who may come into the country, but uses the federal government's database to confirm immigration status.

<p>The challenge focused solely on issues of state law as the federal courts have already enjoined portions of the bill from taking effect. Last year, the <a href="http://www.ck10.uscourts.gov/index.php">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-upholds.php">affirmed a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] of HB 1804, but did permit the state to enact a provision whereby businesses would have to check their employment roster against a state list of eligible workers through a pilot program. A district court judge had <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-judge-enjoins-oklahoma.php">originally issued the injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking enforcement in 2008 concluding that it was "substantially likely" that the provisions are preempted by federal immigration law, and that there was a risk of harm to the plaintiffs if the challenged provisions were to come into effect on July 1, 2008. Last month, the US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href = "/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] ruled in <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">uphold an Arizona immigration</a> [JURIST report] law that imposes penalties on businesses that hire illegal immigrants. There are currently federal court challenges over preemption of other immigration bills passed by <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Manadel Al-Jamadi was <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/cia-tried-to-cover-up-death-of.php">captured</a> [JURIST report] by US Navy SEALs on November 4, 2003 and held in Abu Ghraib prison as a "ghost detainee," or unregistered prisoner, for his suspected involvement in the bombing of a Red Cross center in Baghdad that killed 12 people. Ninety minutes after entering <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] custody he was dead and his body was preserved in ice, allegedly to cover up the circumstances of his death. Al-Jamadi's death at the detention center was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/dead-iraqi-prisoner-in-abu-ghraib.php">ruled a homicide</a> [JURIST report] and the US military never revealed the exact circumstances, though reports show he died while suspended by his wrists, which were handcuffed behind his back.

Charles Graner</a> [JURIST news archive]. In February 2010, the same court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/top-military-appeals-court-upholds-abu.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of two soldiers found guilty of offenses committed as guards at Abu Ghraib. Army Spc. Sabrina Harman had been <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/newcaaf/opinions/2009SepTerm/08-0804.pdf">convicted</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-miltary-jury-convicts.php">report</a>] of conspiracy, dereliction of duty and maltreatment of prisoners dating back to November 2003. Sgt.

<a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>] supporters to vacate Judge Vaughn Walker's holding that the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Proposition 8 supporters had sought to have Walker recused for a conflict of interest after he revealed that he has been in a same-sex relationship for more than 10 years. In his ruling Tuesday, Chief District Judge James Ware denounced using sex, sexuality or race as grounds for recusal:<blockquote>In a case that could affect the general public based on the circumstances or characteristics of various members of that public, the fact that a federal judge happens to share the same circumstances or characteristic and will only be affected in a similar manner because the judge is a member of the public, is not a basis for disqualifying the judge under Section 455(b)(4). In applying this conclusion to the present case, the Court finds that Judge Walker was not required to recuse himself under Section 455(b)(4) on the ground that he was engaged in a long-term same-sex relationship and, thus, could reap speculative benefit from an injunction halting enforcement of Proposition 8 in California. In particular, in a case involving laws restricting the right of various members of the public to marry, any personal interest that a judge gleans as a member of the public who might marry is too attenuated to warrant recusal. Requiring recusal because a court issued an injunction that could provide some speculative future benefit to the presiding judge solely on the basis of the fact that the judge belongs to the class against whom the unconstitutional law was directed would lead to a Section 455(b)(4) standard that required recusal of minority judges in most, if not all, civil rights cases. Congress could not have intended such an unworkable recusal statute.</blockquote>Also Tuesday, Ware <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Prop.-8-Ware-order-on-video-6-14-11.pdf">set an August 29 hearing</a> [order, PDF] to determine whether video of the Proposition 8 trial can be released for public broadcast.

<p>The fate of Proposition 8 is still lingering in appeals courts. In March, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ninth-circuit-refuses-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">denied a motion</a> [JURIST report] filed by California <a href="http://oag.ca.gov/">Attorney General Kamala Harris</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/california-ag-asks-ninth-circuit-to-lift-same-sex-marriage-stay.php">lift the stay order</a> [JURIST report] prohibiting gay couples from marrying while the appeal is pending. In February, the <a href = "www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/california-supreme-court-agrees-to-rule-on-prop-8-standing-issue.php">decide a critical procedural issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine if the pending federal appeal can continue. When Walker struck down Proposition 8 last year, then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former attorney general and current Governor <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Jerry Brown</a> [official website], who were originally defendants in the lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/california-governor-ag-seek-immediate-resumption-of-same-sex-marriages.php">refused to continue defending the measure on appeal</a> [JURIST report], leaving defendant-intervenors Project Marriage [advocacy website] and other groups to defend the law. It is unclear whether they have standing to do so.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=167912&ctNode=445">new law requires</a> [<em>Taiwan Today</em> report] that judges be evaluated every three years by a committee that will include two academics and two impartial people from the community to be selected by the Judicial Yuan from recommendations from the <a href="http://www.moj.gov.tw/mp095.html">Ministry of Justice</a> and <a href="http://www.tba.org.tw/">Taiwan Bar Association</a> [official websites]. The committee then recommends disciplinary action, if necessary, to an internal tribunal made up of five senior judges, which has the final say. Victims of a crime or parties in a case may also request evaluation of a judge. A similar 27-member committee made up of 12 judges, 11 Judicial Yuan members, and four outsiders will be responsible for reviewing the appointment, transfer, rewarding, suspension and dismissal of judges. But many critics say that the measure <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i9QcQqcKLLQlAESnliQ72jGctghg?docId=CNG.b80e20ba7a8a0ad5c8dedc098860570c.5c1">removes judicial independence</a> [AFP report] because judges can potentially be fired mid-term. The law was passed in response to corruption in the judiciary and in the wake of judges acquitting alleged child molesters. 

<p>Taiwan has had increasing difficulties with corruption. In November 2010, the Taiwan Supreme Prosecutors Office <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/taiwan-judicial-officials-indicted-on-bribery-corruption-charges.php">indicted 13 people</a> [JURIST report], including three High Court judges, on charges of bribery, corruption and money laundering. The three judges were accused of accepting more than NT $5 million (USD $155,000) from <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ho+Chi">former legislator Ho Chi-Hui</a> [JURIST news archive] in exchange for clearing him of charges related to a corrupt land-development project. Last August, the <a href="http://www.tpc.moj.gov.tw/mp103.html">Taipei Prosecutors Office</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/taiwan-prosecutors-raid-judges.php">conducted raids</a> [JURIST report] on the homes of several High Court judges and 18 other locations searching for evidence related to the bribery deals. The three High Court judges were <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/taiwan-judicial-officials-arrested-for-corruption.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on corruption charges in July 2010 and were suspended from duty following their arrests. The judges' indictments follows the Taipei High Court's <a href="http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?ID=201011080021&Type=aTOD">acquittal</a> [CNA report] of former Taiwanese president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chen+Shui-bian">news archive</a>] on charges of <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-for.php">embezzling USD $20 million from banks</a> [JURIST report] that sought to protect themselves during Chen's financial reform program.

Ruling 4-3, the court stated that lower court Judge Maryann Sumi had "invaded the legislature's constitutional powers."<blockquote>The court's decision on the matter now presented is grounded in separation of powers principles. It is not affected by the wisdom or lack thereof evidenced in the Act. Choices about what laws represent wise public policy for the State of Wisconsin are not within the constitutional purview of the courts. The court's task in the action for original jurisdiction that we have granted is limited to determining whether the legislature employed a constitutionally violative process in the enactment of the Act. We conclude that the legislature did not violate the Wisconsin Constitution by the process it used.</blockquote><a href = "http://www.doj.state.wi.us">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.html?content=html&seqNo=66078">stated</a> [press release], "The Court has vindicated our arguments that the Dane County Circuit Court overstepped its Constitutional authority when it sought to invalidate the Budget Repair Bill on the basis of an alleged violation of the Open Meetings Law." <a href = "http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] was also <a href = "http://whbl.com/news/articles/2011/jun/14/supreme-court-issues-ruling-enacting-collective-bargaining-law/">pleased with the decision</a> [WHBL report]. The law is reported to take effect on <a href = "http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/123921154.html">June 29</a> [<em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em> report].

<p>The Budget Repair Bill requires state employees to contribute a percentage of their salaries to their pension and health care premiums, and eliminates the ability of public employee union members to collectively negotiate anything but wage increase, which will be capped by the Consumer Price Index. In March, Sumi <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">temporarily enjoined the law from being published</a>, and then <a href = "/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-clarifies-ruling-blocking-union-bargaining-law.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST reports] clarifying that the temporary restraining order prohibits not only publication of the bill, but implementation of its provisions as well.

Representatives <a href = "http://kucinich.house.gov">Dennis Kucinich</a> (D-OH) and <a href = "http://jones.house.gov">Walter Jones</a> (R-NC) [official websites] held a press conference <a href = "http://kucinich.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=246711">announcing</a> [press release] the filing in the <a href = "http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website]. Arguing that Obama is in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art1frag7_user.html#art1_sec8cl11">Article 1, Section 8</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the US Constitution, which grants Congress the power to declare war, the representatives are seeking injunctive and declaratory relief:<blockquote>The Libyan operations ordered by President Obama constitute "war" for the purpose of Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution. President Obama prosecuted the war without a declaration of Congress with the use of funds never approved for such a war. These actions have avoided a public vote on a war that is, according to recent poll, only supported by twenty-three percent of Americans. ... Obama's war in Libya is precisely what the Framers opposed&#8212;and thought they had barred&#8212;in requiring an open, public declaration for wars. The Obama Administration has read the mandatory consent of Congress out of the Constitution and replaced it with a purely discretionary power of the President to commence war with or without congressional approval. As members of Congress, the Plaintiffs assert the right to challenge a per se violation of Article I of the Constitution as well as the violation of statutory laws governing the commencement and funding of any undeclared war.</blockquote>The complaint also alleges violations of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_33.html">1973 War Powers Resolution</a> [50 USC &#167; 1541 <em>et seq.</em>]. On Tuesday, Speaker of the House <a href = "http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] sent a <a href = "http://www.speaker.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=246444">letter</a> [text] to Obama warning that he was within five days of violating the War Powers Resolution and demanded an explanation. Later on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed Libya in the <a href = "http://www.c-span.org/Events/White-House-Briefing-with-Press-Secretary-Jay-Carney/10737422293-1/">daily briefing</a> [C-Span report], stating that because there are no troops on the ground, there is no war and thus no violation of the War Powers Resolution. 

<p>In March, US <a target="_blank" href="http://amash.house.gov/">Representative Justin Amash</a> (R-MI) [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://amash.house.gov/press-release/amash-announces-bill-halt-libyan-strikes-until-congress-approves">announced</a> [press release] legislation requiring an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/lawmaker-proposes-halt-to-us-military-action-in-libya.php">immediate halt to military action in Libya</a> [JURIST report] until Congress authorizes its resumption. The <a target="_blank" href="https://amash.house.gov/sites/amash.house.gov/files/RECLAIMAct.pdf">Restoring Essential Constitutional Constraints for Libyan Action Involving the Military (RECLAIM) Act</a> [text, PDF] cites Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution while declaring that Obama must obtain authorization before any further military action is conducted. The bill is still in committee and has <a target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.01212:">yet to be voted on</a> [bill materials]. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/odyssey-dawn.htm">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a US-led military operation, has been conducting air strikes against the government of Libyan leader <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaddafi">news archive</a>] since March. The action began after the UN Security Council approved <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cfr.org/libya/un-security-council-resolution-1973-libya/p24426">Resolution 1973</a> [text], imposing a no-fly zone over the country. The mission, as well as US involvement absent Congressional approval, has been controversial. JURIST Contributing Editor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/kelly/index.php">Michael J Kelly</a> [official profile] has argued that <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-president-does-not-need-congressional-approval-for-libya-no-fly-zone-yet.php">Obama has the constitutional authority</a> [JURIST op-ed] to conduct the operation under the 1973 War Powers Resolution. JURIST Guest Columnist <a target="_blank" href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a> [official profile] has argued that the <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-use-of-force-against-libya-another-illegal-use-of-force.php">operation violates international law</a> [JURIST op-ed] by failing to comport with Article 42 of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a> [text], which requires a determination that "measures not involving the use of force" have failed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38725&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">published</a> [press release] a preliminary <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/17session/A.HRC.17.CRP.1_Englishonly.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] describing human rights violations in Syria and calling for an investigation into government-authorized abuses related to pro-democracy protests that began earlier this year. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] instructed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] to compile a report detailing the human rights conditions in Syria from May 15 to June 15. The report indicates that, initially, protestor grievances focused on corruption, discrimination, freedom of expression, participation in public affairs and the release of political prisoners, but later shifted to concerns about deprivation of basic fundamental rights and Syrian security force protest-control tactics. Pillay's report contains allegations that Syrian security forces used live ammunition against unarmed civilians, arbitrarily detained protestors, and tortured and killed over 1,000 people. The report called for the Syrian government to permit further investigation and reflected Pillay's optimism in collecting more information about the abuses:<blockquote>The material currently before the High Commissioner is a matter of grave concern and reflects a dire human rights situation in the Syrian Arab Republic. The alleged breaches of the most fundamental rights on such a broad scale require thorough investigation and, with respect to the perpetrators, full accountability. The fact-finding mission mandated by the Human Rights Council would contribute substantially toward these ends. The High Commissioner thus renews her call to the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic to grant the access requested. The High Commissioner is hopeful that she will be able to provide a more extensive assessment of the human rights situation in Syria in her follow-up report to the 18th session of the Human Rights Council.</blockquote>The Syrian government claims that armed protestors have killed over one hundred security forces, and continues to prohibit journalists and human rights groups from investigating.

<p>There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. Most recently, the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38702&amp;Cr=syria&amp;Cr1=">expressed concern</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-urges-nonviolence-in-syria.php">report</a>] over violence in Syria and urged the Syrian government to stop using force against protesters. In June, Syrian and international human rights groups urged the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the hundreds of civilian deaths during protests against Syrian <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile]. The UNHRC, in an emergency special session in April, <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4dbfe77d2.pdf">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">report</a>] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">called for Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also in April, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued. Earlier in the same month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">stopped medical personnel</a> [JURIST report], sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. A spokesperson for the group called the practice "both inhumane and illegal." Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] in March to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence. As demonstrations continued throughout the country in March, the government <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/1119018/1/.html">freed 260 political detainees</a> [AFP report] in an overture to the protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He is set to make his initial appearance before the ICTR to answer to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including rape. He is alleged to have recruited, trained and led a militia group that killed and raped Tutsi women during the <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Rwandan+Genocide">news archive</a>].

After taking a week to interview 25 candidates, the <a href="http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=70787">JSC panel selected</a> [KBC report] one woman and four men to present to Kenyan <a href="http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/presidents/kibaki/profile.htm">President Mwai Kibaki</a> [official profile] for appointment. The list of nominations was submitted to Kibaki for direct appointment because Article 166(1)(b) of Kenya's <a href="http://www.kenyalaw.org/klr/fileadmin/pdfdownloads/Constitution_of_Kenya__2010.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF] exempts the appointees from questioning by the <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ke/">Parliament of the Republic of Kenya</a> [official website]. The Chief Justice (CJ), Deputy Chief Justice (DCJ) and Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) had already been nominated by the JSC, appointed by the president, and approved by parliament pursuant to the country's new constitution. The Constitutional Implementation Oversight Committee, in a <a href="http://www.apsea.or.ke/reforms/index.php/component/docman/doc_download/29-parliamentary-report-on-the-nominations-to-the-office-s-of-chief-justice-attorney-general-director-">report</a> [text, PDF] detailing the criteria and process for selecting the CJ, DCJ and DPP, recommended that interview panels evaluating future nominations also create documents describing the methodology for the selection process.

<p>In February, Kenneth Marende, Speaker of the Kenyan <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/">National Assembly</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.bunge.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=190:speakers-ruling-on-proposed-motions-by-house-committees&amp;catid=31:breaking-news&amp;Itemid=46">ruled</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kenya-parliament-speaker-rules-presidential-nominations-unconstitutional.php">report</a>] that the CJ, DCJ and DPP nominations violated a constitutional provision. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/index.php">High Court of Nairobi</a> [official website] also ruled that the nominations were unconstitutional because they <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kenya-high-court-rules-judicial-appointments-unconstitutional.php">violated promises of gender equality</a> [JURIST report]. Kibaki <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">signed a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] into law in August 2010 as part of a reform movement aimed at curbing vast presidential powers. Kenya's new constitution includes numerous checks on presidential authority, among which are the creation of a supreme court and senate. The new constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/opponents-of-kenya-constitution-concede-in-referendum.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by popular referendum earlier that same month. Voting on the constitution took place amid concerns that high turnout and heated debate over the referendum could cause a repeat of the violence seen during the country's <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/kenya-protesters-allege-fraud-in.php">presidential election</a> [JURIST report] in 2007. The creation of a new constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kenya-president-opposition-reach.php">part of a power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] reached in 2009 between Kibaki and opposition leader <a href="http://www.primeminister.go.ke/index.cfm">Prime Minister Raila Odinga</a> [official website] that brought to an end the civil unrest that followed the contested election. Election officials sought to make the referendum as inclusive and peaceful as possible by <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kenya-court-allows-prisoners-to-vote-in-constitutional-referendum.php">allowing prisoners to vote</a> and prosecuting those who <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/kenya-mps-arrested-for-hate-speech.php">suggested violence in reaction to the changes</a> [JURIST reports] under hate speech laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a controversial move, the ECCC closed <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/286">Case 3</a> [materials] in April, one of four Cases supposed to be brought for atrocities committed under the Khmer Rouge regime. Cambodia media reports say that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8oHhoRjZdGmNrIa6WUisV18DNmA?docId=CNG.b3569aafd06fe78f58be73c5faaa97a5.821">five UN staff resigned</a> [AFP report] in protest after a decision by the chamber to not pursue Case 3. In a published <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sgsm13642.doc.htm">statement</a> [press release] a spokesperson for UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] said:<blockquote>the United Nations categorically rejects media speculation that we have instructed the Co-Investigating Judges to dismiss [Case 3]. It similarly follows that the United Nations will not comment on issues which remain the subject of judicial consideration, nor speculate on actions that should or should not be taken by the judges or prosecutors in any case. As is normal practice, the United Nations will also not comment on internal United Nations administrative or staffing processes related to the ECCC. The United Nations will ensure that the international component of the ECCC, including the Office of the Co-Investigating Judges, has sufficient resources to undertake its work.</blockquote>The statement said that the investigations are not to be conducted in public and must remain confidential as is consistent with the civil law system of Cambodia. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13774963">criticized</a> [BBC report] what it called <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/focus/international_justice/articles_publications/publications/cambodia-eccc-20110614/cambodia-eccc-20110614.pdf">"blatant" attempts</a> [report, PDF] by the Cambodian government to influence the proceedings and urged the UN and the international community to do more to defend the judicial independence of the ECCC. Some critics believe that the investigation into ECCC Case 3 was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iK6IPzDJ00_qva04dwECJOQzsKcg?docId=bd9f5f4106f54b4e9a2d83d7acec741e">ended prematurely</a> [AP report] after demands by Cambodian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] to limit the prosecutions.

<p>Doubts about the legitimacy and independence of the ECCC have been raised since the decision to close ECCC Case 3. Last month, a coalition of more than 30 rights groups and development organizations in Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-groups-urge-more-transparency-for-khmer-rouge-tribunal.php">issued an open letter</a> [JURIST report] urging the ECCC to embrace a greater degree of transparency. In the letter, the groups outline "grave concerns" that the highly classified nature of Case 3 and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/98">Case 4</a> [materials] betrays a lack of "genuine" effort to bring the former members of the Khmer Rouge [BBC profile; JURIST news archives] to justice and implicates that the "impartiality, integrity and ... independence of ECCC judges are being tainted." Earlier that week, ECCC judges ordered Co-Prosecutor Andrew Cayley to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eccc-judges-order-prosecutor-to-retract-statement-demanding-further-investigation-into-khmer-rouge-s.php">retract public statements requesting further investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Case 3. Cayley said the information was released pursuant to tribunal rules "to ensure that the public is duly informed about ongoing ECCC proceedings." The judges, however, said Cayley breached the tribunal's confidentiality and ordered the retraction. The only ECCC conviction since its founding in 2006 is of <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/indicted-personpage/kaing-guek-eav">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=kaing">news archive</a>], better known as "Duch," a former prison chief at the notorious Toul Sleng prison under the Khmer Rouge. In March, he <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-khmer-rouge-official-in-court-to-appeal-war-crimes-convictions.php">appealed</a> his 35-year sentence for war crimes and crimes against humanity <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">handed down by the ECCC</a> [JURIST reports] last July. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit, which was filed in the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website], alleges that the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/data/JR1SB-11.pdf">Budget Repair Bill</a> [Senate Bill 11 text, PDF] violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights">First</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [texts]. According to the plaintiffs, the bill discriminates among groups of public employees and eliminates basic union rights, like bargaining, organizing and associating. Phil Neuenfeldt, president of <a href="http://www.wisaflcio.org/">Wisconsin State AFL-CIO</a> [official website], condemned Wisconsin <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] for implementing the law and described the law as unconstitutional:<blockquote>Not only have Scott Walker and his deep-pocketed corporate allies sought to silence the voices of Wisconsin workers, they have also violated those workers constitutional rights. Scott Walker has created two classes of public sector workers and that is unconstitutional. When a legislature discriminates among classes of workers, especially when doing so has more to do with political payback than with any legitimate reasoning, the law has been violated.</blockquote>The lawsuit seeks to enjoin several provisions of the Budget Repair Bill, namely, those that prohibit unions from bargaining and associating freely. The unions do not, however, seek to enjoin the pension and health insurance contribution requirements, acknowledging that "Wisconsin workers would do their part to share in the sacrifice and keep our state moving forward."

<p>The Budget Repair Bill requires state employees to contribute a percentage of their salaries to their pension and health care premiums, and eliminates the ability of public employee union members to collectively negotiate anything but wage increase, which will be capped by the Consumer Price Index. The <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/opinion/DisplayDocument.html?content=html&amp;seqNo=66078">upheld</a> [opinion, text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">report</a>] the Budget Repair Bill on Tuesday, overruling the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">finding</a> [JURIST report] that legislators had violated the "open meetings" rule. In March, the Dane County Circuit Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">temporarily enjoined the law from being published</a>, and then <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-clarifies-ruling-blocking-union-bargaining-law.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST reports] clarifying that the temporary restraining order prohibits not only publication of the bill, but implementation of its provisions as well. The judge's temporary restraining order stemmed from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed earlier in March by District Attorney Ismael Ozanne claiming that Republican legislators passed the bill in violation of Wisconsin's open meetings law. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law by Walker on March 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, "United States Activities in Libya," was released in response to recent criticisms of American intervention in Libya, including: a <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:292:./list/bss/d112HE.lst::">resolution</a> [bill materials] passed in the <a href = "http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] calling for withdrawal without congressional approval; a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=246444">letter</a> [text]  to Obama from House Speaker <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website]  warning that he was within five days of violating the War Powers Resolution; and Representatives <a href="http://kucinich.house.gov">Dennis Kucinich</a> (D-OH) and <a href="http://jones.house.gov">Walter Jones</a> (R-NC) [official websites] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/lawmakers-file-suit-against-obama-for-continuing-actions-in-libya.php">filing a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking an injunction on the Libya action. The report argues that America is merely providing support as is required by several international treaties and does not have enough participation in the conflict to declare war.<blockquote>The President is of the view that the current US military operations in Libya are consistent with the War Powers Resolution and do not under that law require further congressional authorization, because US military operations are distinct from the kind of "hostilities" contemplated by the Resolution's 60 day termination provision. US forces are playing a constrained and supporting role in a multinational coalition, whose operations are both legitimated by and limited to the terms of a United Nations Security Council Resolution that authorizes the use of force solely to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under attack or threat of attack and to enforce a no-fly zone and an arms embargo. US operations do not involve sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces, nor do they involve the presence of US ground troops, US casualties or a serious threat thereof, or any significant chance of escalation into a conflict characterized by those factors.</blockquote>The report endorsed a <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:194:./list/bss/d112SE.lst::">pending resolution</a> [bill materials] that would provide some congressional support for continued efforts in Libya, though not approval of declaring war. The report also detailed that the US has spent USD $716 million and will spend $1.1 billion by the end of September.

<p>In March, US <a href="http://amash.house.gov/">Representative Justin Amash</a> (R-MI) [official website] <a href="http://amash.house.gov/press-release/amash-announces-bill-halt-libyan-strikes-until-congress-approves">announced</a> [press release] legislation requiring an <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/lawmaker-proposes-halt-to-us-military-action-in-libya.php">immediate halt to military action in Libya</a> [JURIST report] until Congress authorizes its resumption. The <a href="https://amash.house.gov/sites/amash.house.gov/files/RECLAIMAct.pdf">Restoring Essential Constitutional Constraints for Libyan Action Involving the Military (RECLAIM) Act</a> [text, PDF] cites Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution while declaring that Obama must obtain authorization before any further military action is conducted. The bill is still in committee and has <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.01212:">yet to be voted on</a> [bill materials]. <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/odyssey-dawn.htm">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], a US-led military operation, has been conducting air strikes against the government of Libyan leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaddafi">news archive</a>] since March. The action began after the UN Security Council approved <a href="http://www.cfr.org/libya/un-security-council-resolution-1973-libya/p24426">Resolution 1973</a> [text], imposing a no-fly zone over the country. The mission, as well as US involvement absent Congressional approval, has been controversial. JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.creighton.edu/law/faculty/kelly/index.php">Michael J Kelly</a> [official profile] has argued that <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-president-does-not-need-congressional-approval-for-libya-no-fly-zone-yet.php">Obama has the constitutional authority</a> [JURIST op-ed] to conduct the operation under the 1973 War Powers Resolution. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://doebbler.net/default.aspx">Curtis Doebbler</a> [official profile] has argued that the <a href="/forum/2011/03/the-use-of-force-against-libya-another-illegal-use-of-force.php">operation violates international law</a> [JURIST op-ed] by failing to comport with Article 42 of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/index.shtml">UN Charter</a> [text], which requires a determination that "measures not involving the use of force" have failed. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> [official profile] argues that the <a href = "/forum/2011/05/jordan-paust-libya-war-powers.php">War Powers Resolution does not limit</a> [JURIST op-ed] the president's options in Libya due to his constitutional authority and international obligations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Assembly <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/Press/20110615a/">passed</a> [press release] the Marriage Equality Act, drafted by <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> (D) [official website], Wednesday evening 80-63, sending it to the Senate. The Assembly has passed same-sex marriage bills before both in 2007 and then twice in 2009. The bill would enable same-sex couples to be married across the state and provide them with equal marriage rights to heterosexual couples. But the bill specifies that no clergy member will be forced to perform a marriage ceremony. Senate majority leader <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/senator/dean-g-skelos">Dean Skelos</a> (R) [official website] sent the bill to conference where it has stalled. Skelos controls whether the bill will come to the Senate floor for a vote. It is unclear whether the bill has enough votes in the Senate to pass.

<p>Though New York has yet to legalize same-sex marriage it does recognize such marriages performed in other states and has previously considered legalizing it. Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/">New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/new-york-appeals-court-allows-surviving-same-sex-spouse-to-inherit-estate.php">upheld</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-surviving.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST reports] allowing the surviving spouse of a same-sex marriage legally performed in Canada to inherit the deceased spouse's estate. Former New York governor <a href="http://www.state.ny.us/governor/bio/index.html">David Paterson</a> (D) [official profile] introduced same-sex marriage legislation in April 2009, and in May 2008, issued a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/new-york-to-recognize-out-of-state-same.php">mandate</a> [JURIST report], requiring that any and all out-of-state same-sex marriages be recognized as legal within the state of New York. The mandate was supported by an intermediate appellate court ruling in <a href="http://www.nyclu.org/files/martinez_decision_020108.pdf">Martinez v. County of Monroe</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/02/new-york-court-rules-that-state-must.php">report</a>], holding that legal same-sex marriages performed outside the state are entitled to recognition in New York. In September of that year, the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/12jd/index.shtml">New York Supreme Court for the Bronx</a> (lowest court) [official website] <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/09/new-york-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to Paterson's directive. In 2007, former New York governor <a href="http://www.ny.gov/governor/">Eliot Spitzer</a> (D) [official website] also introduced a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prosecutors said Bashir <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hvaGDA-PvBBtkaCJg04aMPZcBbkQ?docId=CNG.f35afd4820d245c4cf6bc576e0d51ac3.591">provided more than $62,000 to the group</a> [AFP report], which was allegedly planning attacks modeled after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=" mumbai+attacks""="">2008 Mumbai terror attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] and targeting high-profile members of the Indonesian government. Bashir was <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/d9nstbv80/spiritual-leader-of-bali-bombers-gets-15-years-on-terror-charge-linked-to-new-militant-camp.html">found guilty</a> [AP report] of inciting terrorism in connection with the terrorist training camp. He was not convicted, however, of funding terrorist activities because there was not enough evidence to prove Bashir's money contributed to purchasing guns for use at the training camp. The 72-year-old said he would appeal the sentence because it ignores <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sharia">Sharia law</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>Bashir's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/radical-indonesia-cleric-tried-for-terrorism.php">began in February</a> [JURIST report] in the District Court of South Jakarta.

United States</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder] that a federal sentencing law does not permit sentencing judges to impose or lengthen prison terms for the purpose of fostering the defendant's rehabilitation. Alejandra Tapia was convicted of smuggling unauthorized aliens into the US, for which the guidelines recommended a sentence between 41 and 51 months. The judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of California sentenced Tapia to 51 months with the stated reason that the judge wanted the Tapia to facilitate the completion of the state's <a href="http://www.bop.gov/inmate_programs/substance.jsp">500-hour drug abuse treatment program</a> [RDAP fact sheet text]. The opinion of the court by Justice Elena Kagan held that <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/us/title18/18usc3582.html">18 USC &#167; 3582(a)</a> [text] does not authorize a sentencing judge to impose a sentence in order for a defendant to take part in a rehabilitation program since the provision "recogniz[es] that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation." The court said that Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 in order to reduce the disparities in sentencing for similarly situated defendants when judges were left to their own "almost unfettered discretion." Thus, taken Congress's clear proscription to not consider rehabilitation it is improper for judges to take that into consideration. The court said:<blockquote>We note first what we do not disapprove about Tapia&#8217;s sentencing. A court commits no error by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or training programs. To the contrary, a court properly may address a person who is 
about to begin a prison term about these important matters. ... So the sentencing court here did 
nothing wrong&#8212;and probably something very right&#8212;in trying to get Tapia into an effective drug treatment program. But the record indicates that the court may have done more&#8212;that it may have selected the length of the sentence to ensure that Tapia could complete the 500 Hour Drug Program. ... the court may have calculated the length of Tapia's sentence to ensure that she receive certain rehabilitative services. And that a sentencing court may not do.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotormayor concurred, joined by Samuel Alito, agreeing with the court's holding but expressing reservations of whether the judge violated it. Sotomayor argued that the judge also properly relied on deterring further criminal behavior in imposing a sentence at the high end of the guidelines but ultimately agreed with the court saying, "I cannot be certain that he did not lengthen Tapia's sentence to promote rehabilitation in violation of &#167;3582(a)."

<p>The decision overturns the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], which <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2010/04/16/09-50248.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the trial judge made no error when basing Tapia's sentence on speculation that she could enter and complete the state's rehabilitation program. The <a href="https://ecf.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] has similarly held that a longer sentence to promote rehabilitation is permissible, but the US Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, Eleventh and DC Circuits have held that it is <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/10-05400qp.pdf">prohibited</a> [issue list, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

North Carolina</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-argument-in-miranda-right-to-counsel-cases.php">report</a>] that a court should consider a juvenile's age when determining whether the individual is in custody for purposes of the Miranda warning as set forth in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0384_0436_ZS.html">Miranda v. Arizona</a> [opinion text]. JDB, a middle-school student, was removed from a classroom and questioned by two law enforcement officers about an incident that took place outside the school campus. The juvenile subsequently made incriminating statements, but was not advised of his Fifth Amendment rights pursuant to Miranda. The Supreme Court of North Carolina <a href="http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/sc/opinions/2009/pdf/190-09-1.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the student was not in custody when he made the statements and therefore not entitled to the protections of Miranda or <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_7B/GS_7B-2101.html">North Carolina statute 7B-2101(a)</a> [text]. Miranda warnings are recited to protect a suspect from the inherently coercive nature of police questioning and the Miranda custody analysis requires an examination of the objective circumstances surrounding the interrogation to determine whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the majority, pointed out that children lack the requisite understanding and reasoning skills to make mature judgments:<blockquote>In some circumstances, a child's age "would have affected how a reasonable person" in the suspect's position "would perceive his or her freedom to leave." That is, a reasonable child subjected to police questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit when a reasonable adult would feel free to go. We think it clear that courts can account for that reality without doing any damage to the objective nature of the custody analysis.</blockquote>She indicated that the law has traditionally operated on this assumption and that the court's ruling "does not mean that a child's age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case, but it is a reality that courts cannot ignore." The case was reversed and remanded for further consistent proceedings in the North Carolina Supreme Court.

<p>Justice Samuel Alito, writing on behalf of the dissenters, expressed his discontent with the majority's holding, arguing that considering age tarnishes the clear, prophylactic rule established in Miranda. Age, Alito contends, is a subjective circumstance that forces the evaluator to speculate about the suspect's state of mind, therefore, the new rule places a heavy burden on police. Moreover, the dissent suggests that the new rule unduly expands the otherwise rigid Miranda standard and presents a slippery slope which would permit other subjective circumstances, like intelligence and cultural background, to inform the custody analysis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href = "http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/senate/">New Hampshire Senate</a> [official website] asked for the opinion in reaction to <a href = "http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2011/HB0089.html">HB 89</a> [text], a bill passed by the <a href = "http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/">New Hampshire House of Representatives</a> [official website], which would require Delaney to join "as a plaintiff in the lawsuit pending in federal court captioned State of Florida et al. v. United States Department of Health and Human Services et al." The Supreme Court stated that this was beyond the legislature's function.<blockquote>HB 89 would usurp this essential power because it would divest the executive branch entirely of its authority to decide whether it to initiate a particular civil action on the part of the State. The executive branch, not the legislative branch, is empowered to protect the interests of the people by taking care that the laws are faithfully executed.</blockquote>House Majority Leader DJ Bettencourt stated he believed the bill was <a href = "http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/newsstatenewengland/922885-227/court-attorney-general-cant-be-forced-to.html">protecting New Hampshire citizens</a> [<em>Nashua Telegraph</em> report] from health care reform, rather than usurping executive power. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] heard oral arguments earlier this month in the suit New Hampshire was to join. Florida's lawsuit, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/attorneys-general-of-13-states-file.php">filed</a> in March and joined by <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/georgia-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">20 states</a> [JURIST reports], most recently <a href = "/paperchase/2011/01/kansas-ag-files-to-join-health-care-lawsuit.php">Kansas</a> [JURIST report] and the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> (NFIB) [association website; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/small-business-lobby-group-joins-health-care-lawsuit.php">report</a>], seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against what it alleges are violations of <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Article I</a> and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt10_user.html">Tenth Amendment</a> [texts] of the Constitution, committed by levying a tax without regard to census data, property or profession, and for invading the sovereignty of the states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/sc-oral-arguments.php">JURIST report</a>] that when the law for what constitutes a legal search changes between a search and an accompanying trial, the evidence is not excluded. Justice Samuel Alito's opinion states that because suppression of the evidence would do nothing to deter other officers from committing the same error, there's no reason to enforce the exclusionary rule.<blockquote>Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis's claim. Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield "meaningfu[l]" deterrence, and culpable enough to be "worth the price paid by the justice system." The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things. The officers who conducted the search did not violate Davis's Fourth Amendment rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence. Nor does this case involve any "recurring or systemic negligence" on the part of law enforcement. The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful. Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case. Indeed, in 27 years of practice under Leon's good-faith exception, we have "never applied" the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable, innocent police conduct.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurrence. Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, dissented, arguing that the new standard created in <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/search/display.html?terms=arizona%20gant&url=/supct/html/07-542.ZS.html">Arizona v. Gant</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <A href = "/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-decides-iran-compensation.php">report</a>], which the police unknowingly violated, is enough to find a remedy in suppression of evidence. Breyer believed that had <span class="casename">Arizona v. Gant</span> not been decided, there would have been a similar Fourth Amendment violation regardless in the present case to cause a finding similar to Gant, regardless of whether the police acted in good faith or not.

<p>Relying on the standard created in <a href = "http://supreme.justia.com/us/453/454/">New York v. Belton</a> [text], police arrested Willie Davis and searched his vehicle while he was handcuffed at the scene, finding an unregistered revolver. In the interim between Davis' arrest and trial, <span class="casename">Arizona v. Gant</span> was decided, which overturned <span class="casename">Belton</span> and created  a "rule" that police could only search the vehicle for what was in the immediate grasp of the suspect. The previous <span class="casename">Belton</span> standard had allowed arresting officers to search the passenger compartment. The lower court held that the search was illegal under <span class="casename">Gant</span>, but since <span class="casename">Gant</span> had not been decided, the police were acting in good faith, and thus did not exclude the evidence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontantiabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Alabama <a href="http://governor.alabama.gov/default.aspx">Governor Robert Bentley</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.governor.alabama.gov/news/news_detail.aspx?ID=5264">signed into law</a> [press release] a <a target="_blank" href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/SearchableInstruments/2011RS/PrintFiles/HB18-int.pdf">bill</a> [HB 18 text, PDF] that bans <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive] after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill contains no exceptions for cases of rape or incest, but permits an abortion if necessary to prevent the death of or serious risk of injury to the woman. The bill also requires physicians to report instances of abortions to the <a href="http://www.adph.org/">Department of Public Health</a> [official website] and requires the department to issue an annual public report containing abortion-related statistics. Physicians who perform abortions in violation of the law will face criminal charges, injunctions, as well as actions for actual damages brought by the both the mother and father of the unborn child. Current Alabama state law <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/usa-abortion-alabama-idUSN1510860220110615">permits abortions</a> [Reuters report] prior to the stage of fetal viability, usually between 24 and 26 weeks gestation. The Alabama <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/senate/senate.html">Senate</a> and <a href="http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/house.html">House of Representatives</a> [official websites] handily <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/alabama-legislators-pass-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] in early June. Bentley said in a statement, "I believe that life begins at conception and I signed this bill to further commit my promise to protect the life of an unborn child." The law will go into effect on September 1, 2011.

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy</a> [JURIST report], making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. The Obama administration took a stand earlier this month against a controversial Indiana law that prevents health care providers with abortion services from receiving Medicaid funds, saying the law <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">violates federal law</a> [JURIST report]. Several other states have acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. Last month, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/index.htm">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">lawsuit</a> challenging a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">South Dakota law</a> [JURIST reports] requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota <a href="http://markdayton.org/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] signed into law a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to first <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">get a sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ivory Coast <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110616/wl_afp/icoastpoliticsunrestrightsinquiry_20110616010351">vowed to probe human rights violations</a> [AFP report] and violence that has riddled the nation since the election, after which Ouattara was eventually declared the winner. Former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] had to be forcefully removed from office and is currently <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/11/ivory.coast.crisis/?hpt=T2">under the protection of UN personnel</a> [CNN report]. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11159&LangID=E">presented her report</a> [press release] on the situation in the Ivory Coast before the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (HRC) [official website] and expressed concern over human rights abuses by government forces, including rape, executions, and torture. Also on Wednesday, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/06/15/c-te-d-ivoire-act-swiftly-un-inquiry">reported</a> [text; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/06/15/oral-statement-human-rights-council-c-te-d-ivoire">press release</a>] that it had documented human rights violations by both Ouattara and Gbagbo, and commended the Ivory Coast Commission of Inquiry, established by the HRC, for its investigation. However, HRW criticized the commission for refusing to disclose a list of perpetrators most responsible for the rights violations. Corinne Dufka, senior West Africa researcher at HRW, also urged the Ouattara government to make more progress on its promises:<blockquote>The Ouattara government needs to move beyond vague promises of accountability. While President Ouattara has notably asked for the International Criminal Court's assistance, national trials will also be needed. The Ivorian government should promptly investigate crimes by both sides and ask for donors' assistance so it can hold fair, credible trials.</blockquote>HRW insisted that the commission commence judicial proceedings against suspects and release those who have been detained without being charged, as well as continue investigating the international law violations until September.

<p>Earlier this month, an official for the International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of Gbagbo. Last month, Ouattara asked the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/cote-divoire-president-asks-icc-to-launch-probe-into-crimes-after-disputed-november-election.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections last November. Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] then <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-to-begin-investigation-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">submitted a request to the court</a> [JURIST report] to begin an investigation into the Ivory Coast political conflict, but a formal investigation has yet to begin. In April, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also last month, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bayer Corp.</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-state-secrets-privilege-personal-jurisdiction-and-preclusion.php">JURIST report</a>], allowing a class action lawsuit against the company to proceed. The Court held that under the re-litigation exception of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002283----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [28 USC &#167; 2283], a district court exceeded its authority when it enjoined Smith from seeking class certification in state court after denying certification to a similar class. They also declared issues in the federal case and the state tribunal case different enough to warrant separate trials. Finally, the Court declared that the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over Smith, who was not a member of the initial class, and acted improperly when they denied him the ability to relitigate. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion.<blockquote>This case, indeed, is little more than a rerun of Chick Kam Choo. A federal court and a state court apply different law. That means they decide distinct questions. The federal court's resolution of one issue does not preclude the state court's determination of another. It then goes without saying that the federal court may not issue an injunction. The Anti-Injunction Act's re-litigation exception does not extend nearly so far.</blockquote>The opinion emphasized that there are few and narrow exceptions federal courts to enjoin state courts, and this, particularly, was not one of them.

<p>In the case, Keith Smith filed a class action suit against <a href="http://www.bayer.com/">Bayer</a> [corporate website] in West Virginia state court due to claims arising out of Bayer's sale of an allegedly hazardous prescription drug called Baycol. However, George McCollins had previously sued Bayer in federal court seeking class action certification the month before. Eventually, McCollins' class did not receive certification. Due to this, Bayer argued that Smith's class claim, in state court, should also be denied certification under issue preclusion, and was granted an injunction on Smith's proceedings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII Backgrounder; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-1227.pdf">oral arguments transcript</a>; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-enumerated-powers-speedy-trial-deadlines.php">report</a>] that a private individual can challenge whether a federal criminal law passed to implement an international treaty is valid under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text]. Carol Anne Bond was charged with burning her husband's mistress using poisonous chemicals and was indicted under a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000229----000-.html">federal law</a> [18 USC &#167; 229(a) text] created to stop the distribution and use of chemical weapons passed by Congress to comply with the <a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/dda/WMD/cwc/">1993 Chemical Weapons Convention</a> [UN backgrounder]. After losing on a motion to dismiss the charges on grounds that the law violated the Tenth Amendment, Bond entered a conditional guilty plea and renewed her claim on the same grounds. The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruled that Bond <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/082677p.pdf">lacked standing</a> [opinion, PDF] to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the basis of the Tenth Amendment because she was an individual acting on her own and not with a state, relying on <span class="casename">Tennessee Elec. Power Company v. TVA</span>. However, the 9-0 Supreme Court opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy disagreed, holding that Bond has standing to challenge whether the federal law interferes with the powers left only to the states. The court said: <blockquote>to argue that the National Government has interfered with state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment is to assert the legal rights and interests of States and States alone. That, however, is not so. ... Bond seeks to vindicate her own constitutional interests. The individual, in a proper case, can assert injury from governmental action taken in excess of the authority that federalism defines. Her rights in this regard do not belong to a State.</blockquote>The government initially argued that Bond did not have standing to sue on Tenth Amendment grounds but informed the court that it had changed its position. Instead, the government <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/BriefUS.Bond_.pdf">argued</a> [Brief for Peitioner, PDF] that Bond only had standing to challenge whether a federal law "interferes with a specific aspect of state sovereignty" but not whether Congress by passing the law had exceeded its enumerated powers. But the Court said this argument was flawed because:<blockquote>the principles of limited national powers and state sovereignty are intertwined. While neither originates in the Tenth Amendment, both are expressed by it. Impermissible interference with state sovereignty is not within the enumerated powers of the National Government,  and action that exceeds the National Government's enumerated powers undermines the sovereign interests of States.</blockquote> Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred, joined by Stephen Breyer, arguing that Bond had standing because "Bond, like any other defendant, has a personal right not to be convicted under a constitutionally invalid law." The ruling in this case may also affect Congress's authority to pass laws implementing treaties passed by the President. ]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Georgia bill was <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] last month by <a href="http://gov.georgia.gov/02/governor/home/0,2822,165937316,00.html">Governor Nathan Deal</a> [official website]. HB 87 allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. The law also imposes fines and prison sentences of up to one year for anyone who knowingly transports illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the immigration status of potential employees, providing that workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment could face up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Also last month, the ACLU filed two similar lawsuits to block immigration laws in both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">Utah</a> [JURIST reports].

The appeal is challenging a decision last month by Judge James Cacheris to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-strikes-down-ban-on-corporate-donations-to-candidates.php">dismiss a criminal count</a> [JURIST report] against two men charged with  making illegal campaign contributions, citing the controversial Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html">Citizens United</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>]. Fundraisers, William P Danielczyk Jr, chairman of Virginia-based Galen Capital, and its secretary and treasurer, Eugene R Biagi, were indicted for illegally reimbursing individuals for almost $200,000 in contributions to Hillary Clinton's 2006 senate and 2008 presidential primary campaign.

<p>In dismissing the count, Cacheris stated that <span class="casename">Citizens United</span> had dissolved the legal underpinnings for the federal ban against direct contributions from corporations to a candidate. Commentators have noted that Cacheris' opinion does not address the 2003 Supreme Court decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-403.ZS.html">Federal Election Commission v. Beaumont</a> [opinion], which specifically upheld a ban on corporate contributions to election campaigns. Although Cacheris does acknowledge that another federal judge ruled on the same question but upheld the law, his opinion is silent on the Eighth Circuit's appellate ruling likewise upholding the ban. Cecheris' ruling does not follow the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hFFXHfh0tnIHWKcr6uJHTpaLmuJg?docId=15e08682c72a44f786d8aee89f86a8e4">distinction between expenditures and contributions</a> [AP report] upheld by the Eighth Circuit. Despite strong reactions to the ruling, the net impact is unclear because current election law limit individuals to $2,500 per candidate in each election, while corporate political action committees may contribute up to $5,000.</p>]]></content:encoded>

[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] passed the <a href="http://portal.ohchr.org/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/4242370.PDF">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF] with a vote of <a href="http://www.un.org/webcast/unhrc/archive.asp?go=110617">23-19 and 3 abstentions</a> [UN webcast archive] on Friday. The resolution is the first to call for an end to sexuality discrimination worldwide and to recognize it as a "priority" for the UN. Although the resolution is "binding" to member nations of the UNHRC, it does not address any penalties for violating the act. The resolution "express(es) grave concern at acts of violence and discrimination, in all regions of the world, committed against individuals because of their sexual orientation and gender identity." It also requests a study and panel to investigate international violence against homosexuals and trans-people. The resolution was introduced by South Africa, the only African nation to vote for its passage. Several <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110617/wl_afp/unrightsgay">African and Middle Eastern nations criticized</a> [AFP report] South Africa and the bill, accusing the nation of "westernizing" and breaking from what "90 percent" of South Africans want, and decrying the UN trying to force controversial ideas with no legal basis on their countries.

The UN has faced difficulty passing resolutions on gay rights issues, due to no international consensus on the morality of homosexuality. Last year, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report]. Two years ago, the UN passed a <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/491-1.pdf">gay rights declaration</a> [text, PDF], which the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">US signed and sponsored</a> [JURIST report]. The declaration, a nonbinding measure that does not have the full force of a resolution, called on states to end criminalization and persecution of homosexuals. This declaration was recalled by the new resolution. Although <a href="http://geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/22/lgbtrights/">85 countries signed the declaration</a> [US Ambassador statement], 57 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, signed an opposing statement. The year before, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was divided over the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-divided-over-gay.php">issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [JURIST report] as 66 nations signed a statement calling for decriminalization, and nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement. As of the 2011 <a href="http://ilga.org">International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association</a> (ILGA) [advocacy website] <a href="https://ilga.org/sites/default/files/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2011.pdf">State-Sponsored Homophobia report</a> [text, PDF], 76 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, and five enforce the death penalty against homosexuals.]]></content:encoded>

The council, without voting, <a href="http://ca.news.yahoo.com/un-rights-body-extends-mandate-expert-panel-libya-092949909.html">adopted a resolution</a> [AP report] that orders the investigation of abuses in Libya to continue through the end of the year. The three-person commission appointed to investigate violence in Libya published a report early in June finding that Gaddafi's forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">committed crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] and war crimes under orders from Gaddafi and other high-ranking officials. The commission's 92-page report said Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment, and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances, and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." 

<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) Chief Prosecutor <a  href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official websites] announced he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">seeking arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278">Mummar Gaddafi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] and two others in his inner circle on charges of crimes against humanity. The ICC has also launched a probe to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-to-launch-probe-of-gaddafi-crimes-against-libya-protesters.php">investigate allegations of crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report] by the Libyan government. Moreno-Ocampo specifically identified Gaddafi, his sons and his political allies as targets of the investigation and warned Libyan officials that complicity in such abuses would result in prosecution. Additionally, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-to-probe-gaddafi-over-libya-torture-allegations.php">appointed a team of special prosecutors</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations that Gaddafi ordered forces to torture and abduct opponents. Gaddafi is accused of ordering hospital patients' executions, firing on crowds of protesters and using other extreme tactics against his opponents. The UN General Assembly has voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-suspends-libya-from-rights-council.php">suspend Libya</a> [JURIST report] from the UNHRC in response to the violent suppression of peaceful protesters by forces loyal to Gaddafi. The ICC has also said that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/icc-no-immunity-for-perpetrators-of-crimes-against-humanity-in-libya.php">not grant immunity</a> [JURIST report] to any person perpetrating crimes against humanity in Libya.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Victims have 30 days to file a statement. The statement says Moreno-Ocampo will make an investigation request "shortly," although in May he said he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-to-begin-investigation-into-ivory-coast-violence.php">submitted a request</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] asked the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/cote-divoire-president-asks-icc-to-launch-probe-into-crimes-after-disputed-november-election.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections last November. Violence has been ongoing since last year's disputed election, with factions of Ouattara and ousted former president <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] still engaging in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-reports-violence-continues-in-ivory-coast.php">retaliatory killings</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Earlier this week, the Ivory Coast <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">announced it would establish a commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections last November. An official for the International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of Gbagbo earlier this month. In April, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder gave an address at the <a href="http://www.acslaw.org/">American Constitution Society</a> [official website] national convention saying, "our most effective terror fighting weapon [is] our Article III court system." Holder criticized what he called "fear-mongering" from members of Congress who have suggested that trying terror suspects in civilian courts harm the US's national security. <blockquote>Politics has no place&#8212;no place&#8212;in the impartial and effective administration of justice. Decisions about how, where, and when to prosecute must be made by prosecutors, not politicians. And this is true for every case. ...  So long as I am privileged to serve as the attorney general, I will defend the exclusive right of the executive branch to determine appropriate venues and mechanisms for all criminal trials. And I will continue to point&#8212;one indisputable fact, which has been proven repeatedly by this administration and the previous one, in disrupting potential attacks and effectively interrogating, prosecuting, and incarcerating terrorists, there is quite simply, no more powerful tool than our civilian court system.</blockquote>

<p>Earlier this week, McConnell made a speech on the Senate floor arguing to move terror suspects Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi from Kentucky to Guantanamo. He said:<br />
<blockquote>The administration likes to tout its confidence in the US legal system. Well, I don't believe the American people need to try enemy combatants in our towns and cities to prove that our court system works. Prosecution is important. But let's be clear: prosecution is not our ultimate goal in this war. Our goal is to capture or kill those who want to kill us here and abroad and who are plotting even now&#8212;as this case clearly proves&#8212;to wreak havoc on our troops overseas. This is very simple: those we capture should be interrogated and, if necessary, indefinitely detained and tried in a military setting. Through these interrogations additional intelligence can be derived that leads to additional targets thereby weakening Al Qaeda and other associated terror groups at a moment when they are vulnerable.</blockquote><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/I3fa9m0NFjY&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/I3fa9m0NFjY&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="640" height="390"></embed></object></p>

<p>Holder has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">consistently advocated</a> [JURIST report] that terror suspects should be tried in civilian courts though has not found support from Congress. In April, Holder announced that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2811855.stm">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>] and four other co-conspirators will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried before a military commission</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder, who wanted the accused be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report], referred the cases to the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST report] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US. Holder refused to delay the trial any longer for the sake of the victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families, explaining that the restrictions are not likely to be repealed in the immediate future. The Obama administration changed its position despite repeated appeals from rights groups to utilize civilian courts over military commissions for the trials of suspected terrorists. However, international pressure to use civilian courts remains. Last March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">hold civilian trials</a> [JURIST report] for Mohammed and other suspected terrorists saying that the military commissions system is fatally flawed and cannot be reformed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Bashir is scheduled to meet Chinese <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2404129.stm">President Hu Jintao</a> [BBC profile] and other government officials in China at the end of June. China is not currently a party to the ICC's <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/english/rome_statute%28e%29.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] and therefore has no obligation to the international community to arrest al-Bashir. China is, however, a permanent member of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], which formally referred the Darfur case to <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a>, lead prosecutor for the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites]. In joining the council, China agreed to cooperate with ICC decisions. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">charged al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc907140.pdf">three counts of genocide</a> [warrant, PDF] in relation to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder], in addition to seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity that were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">filed against al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009.

<p>The international community and human rights groups have urged various countries to arrest al-Bashir while he has been present inside their borders. Earlier this week, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/malaysia-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">AI called on Malaysia</a> [JURIST report] to withdraw its invitation to al-Bashir and arrest him if he travels to the country. Similarly, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">urged Djibouti to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in May. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">ICC requested that Kenya arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] during an October visit, his second visit to the country in the same year. Previously, al-Bashir had visited Kenya for the signing of the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Following his visit, the ICC <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc930979.pdf">reported Kenya</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">report</a>] to the UN Security Council and the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute for the violation in not arresting al-Bashir. Also following his August visit, former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Kenya to reaffirm its cooperation with the ICC by <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/annan-questions-kenyas-icc-commitment-after-al-bashir-visit.php">arresting al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report]. In July, the ICC called for al-Bashir's <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-al-bashir-will-be-arrested.php">arrest during his visit to Chad</a> [JURIST report], marking the first visit to an ICC member state since the warrants were issued. The ICC also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc931075.pdf">reported Chad</a> [decision, PDF] to the Security Council and Assembly of States Parties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/lang--en/index.htm#a1">100 Session of the International Labor Conference</a> [official website] came to a close Friday. The convention sets standards for domestic workers in line with basic labor rights as those for other workers, including reasonable work hours, weekly rest of at least 24 consecutive hours, a limit on in-kind payment, clear information on terms and conditions of employment, including other basic rights such as freedom of association and collective bargaining. In the introductory text, the convention says it was passed:<blockquote>[r]ecognizing the significant contribution of domestic workers to the global economy, which includes increasing paid job opportunities for women and men workers with family responsibilities, greater scope for caring for ageing populations, children and persons with a disability, and substantial income transfers within and between countries, and ... domestic work continues to be undervalued and invisible and is mainly carried out by women and girls, many of whom are migrants or members of disadvantaged communities and who are particularly vulnerable to discrimination in respect of conditions of employment and of work, and to other abuses of human rights, and... that in developing countries with historically scarce opportunities for formal employment, domestic workers constitute a significant proportion of the national workforce and remain among the most marginalized.</blockquote>The convention must still be ratified by the countries joining it for it to be binding. It is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/international-labor-organization-passes-domestic-workers-rights-bill/story?id=13856422">unlikely that the US will ratify</a> [ABC News report] the treaty since for the most part labor laws are controlled by the states. The US has only ratified two of the ILO's 189 conventions. 

<p>Last September, <a href="http://hrw.org">Human Rights Watch </a>(HRW) [advocacy website] released a report saying <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/hrw-urges-lebanon-to-protect-rights-of-domestic-workers.php">Lebanon should improve its judicial system</a> [JURIST report] by providing mechanisms to better protect the basic rights of domestic workers and more ardently prosecuting those who violate them. Earlier last year, the ILO reiterated its call on the international community to take a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/un-labor-agency-calls-for-rights-based.php">"rights based approach"</a> [JURIST report] to international migration. The group said that 90 percent of the migration that occurs is driven by the search for employment and that countries should seek to provide "conditions of freedom, dignity, equity and security," to migrant workers. It said that under the right conditions migrant workers, could provide benefits to both their countries of employment and origin, but that they currently face low wages, discrimination, and a lack of social or legal protection. In 2008, HRW reported that migrant and domestic workers still face <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/domestic-workers-facing-abusive.php">abusive and exploitative treatment</a> [JURIST report] throughout Asia and the Middle East. The rights group observed that workers in many nations throughout the region lacked access to judicial systems, and often lacked appropriate redress even when granted access. Earlier that year, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/saudi-arabia-urged-to-improve-domestic.php">urged Saudi Arabia</a> [JURIST report] to institute new legal protections for the country's estimated 1.5 million domestic workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge approved the procedural move, which is typical upon the death of a defendant. The <em>nolle prosequi</em> motion listed the hundreds of charges against Bin Laden and explained the government's proof of his death.<blockquote>Shortly after the Abbottabad Raid, US forces collected DNA samples from the body of the deceased individual assessed to be Bin Laden. Those DNA samples were then transported from Abbottabad, Pakistan to U.S. military facilities in Afghanistan, where they were immediately provided to DoD and CIA personnel for processing and comparison. CIA and DoD conducted DNA tests, during which the sample from the Abbottabad Raid was compared with a comprehensive DNA profile derived from DNA collected from multiple members of BIN LADEN's family. These tests confirmed that the sample from the Abbottabad Raid genetically matched the derived comprehensive DNA profile for Usama Bin Laden. The possibility of a mistaken identification is approximately one in 11.8 quadrillion.</blockquote>Bin Laden was <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">killed</a> [JURIST report] in early May by American military forces in Pakistan. Bin Laden had <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/usama-bin-laden/view">topped the US list of Most Wanted Terrorists</a> [FBI backgrounder] and is believed to have approved or helped plan many notorious terror attacks including those against New York and Washington DC on <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11, 2001</a>, the 2000 bombing of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22uss+cole%22">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archives], <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/embassy_bombing/map.html">attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania</a> [PBS backgrounder] in 1998 and the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.

<p>As founder and leader of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive], Bin Laden represents the highest profile terror target captured or killed by the US. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] announced that alleged former al Qaeda chief in the Arabian Peninsula and accused mastermind of the USS Cole bombing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [JURIST news archive] will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/accused-uss-cole-bomber-to-be-tried-in-military-court.php">tried in a military court</a> [JURIST report] rather than in a civilian criminal court. Also last month, US Attorney General Eric Holder announced that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12964158">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC report; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>], a high-ranking al Qaeda member whom US officials say was principally responsible for planning the 9/11 attacks, will be <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">tried by a military tribunal</a> [JURIST report] as well.

The <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2103&amp;ChapAct=750%C2%A0ILCS%C2%A070/&amp;ChapterID=59&amp;ChapterName=FAMILIES&amp;ActName=Parental%20Notice%20of%20Abortion%20Act%20of%201995.">Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 1995</a> [text], which has <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chibrknews-court-orders-trial-for-abortionnotification-law-20110617,0,918729.story">never been enforced</a> [AP report], mandates that doctors notify the guardians of girls younger than 18 years old 48 hours before the girl gets an abortion. Girls can request a court order from a judge to circumvent the notification requirement. The decision reverses a lower court ruling lifting the injunction on the enforcement of the law. The <a href="http://www.thomasmoresociety.org/">Thomas More Society</a> [advocacy website], a supporter of the law, expressed discontent with the appeal court's decision:<blockquote>We strongly disagree with the Illinois Appellate Court's decision to send this back to the trial court without deciding the legal issues involved. This decision is flawed in so many respects that further trial proceedings would be pointless. Only a prompt review by the Illinois Supreme Court can correct the injustice of this law languishing in legal limbo.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], representing the plaintiffs, praised the appeal court decision. Lorie Chaiten, director of the ACLU of Illinois Reproductive Rights Projects <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/statement-on-court-ruling-in-illinois-parental-notice-of-abortion-challenge/">said the law is harmful</a> [press release] and that "young women who do not tell their parents about their pregnancy or desire to have an abortion, have good reasons, including fear for their personal safety."

<p>An Illinois <a href="http://www.cookcountycourt.net/">Cook County Circuit Court</a> [official website] judge <a href="http://www.thomasmoresociety.org/docs/2010/notice/Hope-Memorandum-Opinion.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/illinois-judge-upholds-abortion.php">report</a>] in May 2010 that the law is constitutional and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/illinois-judge-upholds-abortion.php">lifted the temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] on the law's enforcement. Judge Daniel Riley, however, approved a 60-day grace period, preventing state officials from enforcing the law pending appeal procedures. Riley <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/illinois-court-again-delays-enforcement.php">granted the temporary restraining order</a> [JURIST report] in November 2010, only hours after the Illinois Medical Disciplinary Board ruled to begin enforcing the law. The order was originally sought by the ACLU-IL in support of a suit brought by a local medical doctor and a women's clinic on behalf of themselves and their minor patients. ACLU-IL alleged that enforcement of the law would cause major harm and compromise the privacy of some Illinois teen-aged women. The Illinois <a href="http://www.idfpr.com/">Department of Finance and Professional Regulation</a> (DFPR) [official website] granted doctors a <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/illinois-gives-doctors-90-days-to.php">90-day grace period</a> [JURIST report] for enforcement of the parental notification requirement, following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/7th-circuit-dissolves-injunction.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] that reversed a district court <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-refuses-to-allow-illinois.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] barring the law's enforcement. The 1995 law, which has never been enforced, authorizes state judges to waive the notice requirement if doing so would be in a minor's best interest, but otherwise requires parental notification for minors seeking an abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The panel <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1010595--prostitution-remains-outlawed-until-top-court-rules?bn=1">extended the stay</a> [<em>Toronto Star</em> report], which was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ontario-court-extends-stay-for-prostitution-laws.php">already extended</a> [JURIST report] last December, just before the proceedings in the Court of Appeal ended Friday, keeping it in effect until a ruling that is expected to come sometime in the next six months. Justice David Doherty said the stay will remain in effect until the court says otherwise before the judges retired to discuss their decision. Although prostitution is legal in Canada, virtually all of the acts ancillary to exchanging sex for money are not. Last September, the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Ontario Superior Court of Justice</a> (OSCJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/ontario-court-strikes-down-anti-prostitution-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that provisions <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VI::bo-ga:l_VII//en?page=5&isPrinting=false#codese:210">&#167; 210</a>, <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VI::bo-ga:l_VII//en?page=5&isPrinting=false#codese:212">&#167; 212</a> and <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/C-46/bo-ga:l_VI::bo-ga:l_VII//en?page=5&isPrinting=false#codese:213">&#167; 213</a> of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-46/">Canadian Criminal Code</a> [texts], which prohibit the keeping of a "common bawdy house," engaging in communications for the purpose of soliciting sex and living "on the avails" of the sex trade, were a violation of the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text]. 

<p>The legality of prostitution in Canada is in a state of flux pending legal challenges to the constitutionality of anti-prostitution laws. In March, the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.asp">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] agreed to review a <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/">B.C. Court of Appeal</a> [official website] decision allowing a challenge to the country's anti-prostitution laws. In arguing to extend the stay in this case last December, the government said a stay would be necessary until the court could conduct a full review of the decision, while the party challenging the laws argued that the stay would "perpetuate the law's contribution to violence against a vulnerable population." Justice Marc Rosenberg applied the <span class="casename">RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada</span> test for granting a stay pending appeal, which requires the court to balance convenience and public interest considerations of the issue. He concluded that it is in the public interest that the judgment be stayed for a relatively short period to permit appellate review of the decision. In 2007, the <a href="http://spoc.ca/">Sex Professionals of Canada</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/canada-sex-workers-to-challenge.php">initiated an application with the OSCJ</a> [JURIST report] challenging the three provisions overturned in September's ruling on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the Charter. The challenge came on the heels of the trial of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/pickton/">Robert Pickton</a> [CBC case backgrounder], who was <a href="http://www.missingpeople.net/2005/pickton_indictments.htm">accused of murdering 26 women</a> [indictment text], mostly prostitutes, in the Vancouver area in the 1990s. Pickton was <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/archives/article803199.ece">convicted of six counts of murder</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] in late 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed changes would instill more authority in the country's prime minister, who would be given the power to appoint government officials as the "president of the government." The reforms would also ensure that the prime minister is the leader of the largest party in parliament, as opposed to being selected by the king. Mohammed said that if these reforms were approved, it would represent a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13816974">transition to democratic institutions</a> [BBC report] for Morocco. Mohammed would still <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/06/2011617172114510513.html">retain certain important powers</a> [Al Jazeera report] as chair of the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Security Council, leaving him control over the country's security, military and religious institutions. During his speech, Mohammed also emphasized the promotion of human rights in the reforms:<blockquote>[T]he Moroccan Constitution will be a human rights Constitution as well as a charter for citizenship rights and obligations. In this regard, the draft Constitution provides for the pre-eminence of international covenants&#8212;as ratified by Morocco&#8212;over national legislation, as well as gender equality in civil rights, within the framework of respect for the Constitution, and for the Kingdom&#8217;s laws which are derived from Islam. The draft Constitution also provides for equality between men and women in all political, economic, social, cultural and environment-related rights. The draft Constitution confirms the commitment to all human rights, especially the presumption of innocence and guaranteeing the conditions for a fair trial. It criminalizes torture, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and all forms of discrimination and inhuman, degrading practices. The draft Constitution also upholds freedom of the press and of expression and opinion, as well as the right to access information and to submit petitions, in accordance with norms and criteria specified in an organic law.</blockquote>Mohammed's announcement comes amid protests staring in February, which called for democratic reform in Morocco. The changes are set to appear on a referendum July 1. Shortly following the speech, <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/06/201161810543184895.html">protests were called</a> [Al Jazeera report] against the new constitution, with organizers calling for a more democratic constitution.

<p>The announced reform are a product of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/morocco-king-announces-plans-for-constitutional-reform.php">reform process announced</a> in April following <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/morocco-protesters-seek-radical-constitutional-reform.php">peaceful demonstrations</a> [JURIST reports] demanding democratic reforms as part of the wider protests in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12482311">Middle East and North Africa</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=middle+east+protest">news archive</a>]. Mohammed had previously made some concessions since the outbreak of protests including the release of political prisoners.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.mainjustice.com/files/2011/06/Planned-Parenthood-DOJ-Filing.pdf">urged the court to grant an injunction</a> [brief, PDF] to stop the enforcement of an Indiana abortion <a href="http://www.in.gov/apps/lsa/session/billwatch/billinfo?year=2011&session=1&request=getBill&docno=1210">law</a> [HB 1210], which seeks to deny Medicaid funding to organizations that provide abortion services. The DOJ filed the brief in the  <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] seeking to stop the Indiana law which prevents Medicaid funding from going to <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/index.htm">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] for any reason due to their abortion services. In the brief, the DOJ argued that the law violated Medicaid's freedom of choice provisions by eliminating health care providers from coverage. Urging the court to grant the injunction, the DOJ stated:<blockquote>Preliminary injunctive relief is warranted here not only because Indiana's law violates the Medicaid statute, but also because injunctive relief is in the public interest. Injunctive relief will prevent further injury to Indiana's Medicaid beneficiaries. And although Indiana claims that its law serves the public interest because it prevents "taxpayer dollars from indirectly funding abortion[,] advances the State's goal of encouraging women to choose childbirth instead of abortion ... and ensure[s] that women who choose abortion have all the information necessary 
to make an informed and voluntary decision," Congress, in the Medicaid statute, has already made a different policy judgment:  to ensure that beneficiaries who wish to receive Medicaid services&#8212;particularly family planning services&#8212;may receive those services from providers of their own choosing.</blockquote>US District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt has said she will rule on the issue <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PLANNED_PARENTHOOD_INDIANA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">before July 1</a> [AP report]. The judge gave Indiana a week to respond to the DOJ's brief.

<p>The DOJ brief echoes arguments made earlier this month by the Obama administration, which argued <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">against Indiana's law</a> [JURIST report] in a letter to the state. Last month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-indiana-planned-parenthood-cuts.php">refused to block the law</a> [JURIST report]. Several other states have acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. Last month, Planned Parenthood and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota law requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">first get a sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Proponents of the legislation <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_2beaf0be-dd58-51ea-8716-d55d3e7c6b36.html">argued</a> [<em>St. Louis Times</em> report] that it is necessary to protect against election fraud. The bill also contained an extension on early voting, <a href="http://www.newstribune.com/news/2011/jun/17/nixon-vetoes-missouri-photo-id-early-voting-bill/">long sought-after by Missouri Democrats</a> [AP report]. In a <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/newsroom/pdf/2011/sb3veto.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] explaining his decision, Nixon stated:<blockquote>Disenfranchising certain classes of persons is not acceptable. [SB 3] imposes unnecessary burdens on senior citizens and persons with disabilities. Placing a cloud of uncertainty over ballots cast by qualified voters is inconsistent with an individual's right to vote and have that vote counted.</blockquote>Lamenting the veto, State Senator Bill Stouffer, the bill's sponsor, <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/media/11info/Stouffer/releases/061711SB3Vetoed.htm">stated</a> [press release] that "[w]e have to have a picture ID to rent a movie or send something via UPS, but we don't need one to vote. With his veto today, it's a shame the governor doesn't understand the necessity of this bill to fight voter fraud." Detractors argue that it is unnecessary and the election fraud that the bill attempts to prevent has not been demonstrated to exist. Despite Nixon's veto, the photo ID requirement and extended early voting provisions are still being put before the voters on Missouri's 2012 ballot as constitutional amendments. The legislature can also override the veto by two-thirds majority vote in both houses of the legislature.

<p>In 2006, the <a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=27">Supreme Court of Missouri</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/missouri-high-court-rejects-voter-id.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/06info/pdf-bill/tat/SB1014.pdf">similar law</a> [SB 1014, PDF], holding that requiring voters to present ID cards violates the equal protection and voting-rights clauses of the <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/const/moconstn.htm">Missouri Constitution</a> [text]. Applying strict scrutiny analysis, the court found that requiring Missourians to obtain IDs imposes more than a minimal burden on their voting rights, noting that it requires "time, funds and advance planning." The court also held that the provision was not narrowly tailored to the compelling state interest of preventing voter fraud. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill would take full effect after a 24-month phase in period, after which around 40 percent of the state's businesses and all its cities and counties would be required to use the E-Verify system in all future hires. Detractors of the bill argue that it <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/06/18/1282813/weakened-bill-to-prevent-illegal.html">lacks strong enforcement provisions</a> [<em>News &amp; Observer</em> report] and will result in many false complaints. The bill was previously passed by the state Senate, and will now go to <a href="http://www.governor.state.nc.us/">Governor Beverly Perdue</a> [official website] for her veto or signature.

<p>State laws requiring the use of the E-Verify system have recently been introduced throughout the country despite controversy over the concern that the system is not accurate enough to be made mandatory upon employers. In May, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an Arizona law which required employers to utilize the E-Verify system, finding that it was not preempted by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1324a&url=/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001324---a000-.html">Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> [text] and thus not a violation of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi">Supremacy Clause</a> [text]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ben Ali's trial <em>in absentia</em> before civilian and military courts is <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Trial-of-Former-Tunisia-Leader-to-Begin-Monday-124153119.html">set to begin on Monday</a> [VOA report]. If convicted, Ben Ali could face a long prison sentence. The charges stem mostly from allegations that Ben Ali authorized the use of force against protesters during the Tunisian revolution, resulting in more than 200 deaths. <a href="http://www.businessnews.com.tn/details_article.php?t=525&a=23107&temp=1&lang=">Justice Minister Lazhar Karoui Chebbi</a> [profile, in French] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-former-president.php">issuance of an arrest warrant</a> for Ben Ali in January, though the country has not received a response to its <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tunisia-calls-for-saudi-arabia-to-extradite-ousted-president.php">request to extradite</a> [JURIST reports] the former leader from Saudi Arabia, where he remains in exile.

<p>The charges against Ben Ali came after advocacy groups <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] called for the Tunisian transitional government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-tunisia-protester-abuses.php">investigate incidents of police violence</a> against protesters and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hrw-calls-for-end-to-police-violence-in-tunisia-protests.php">end police brutality</a> [JURIST reports].

The leftist opposition party, known as Waad and aligned with the largest Shi'ite opposition group, was shut down in April during the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">pro-democracy protests</a> [JURIST report]. Waad spokesman Radhi al-Mousawi said the party would reopen its headquarters in the capital, Manama, and later its office in Muharraq. Waad is considering engaging in the political dialogue in July with <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38"> King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa</a> [official profile] regarding the kingdom's state of crisis.

<p>In April, al-Khalifa <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">three-month state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, called on the King to impose martial law under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. The Bahraini government's response to the ongoing protests have prompted international concern. In February, UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region. Ban said that he was "disturbed by all these violent means of trying to disperse demonstrators, the freedom of expression, freedom of access to information, particularly the journalists."<br />

Ben Ali fled Tunisia to Saudi Arabia in January during protests against his 23-year autocratic rule in which his <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE75J0MI20110620?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true">family amassed huge wealth</a> [Reuters report] that many Tunisians say was at their expense. But Ben Ali said Monday that <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&section=middleeast&col=">he was "duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis, according to a statement released through his attorney. He said that he was trying to get his family out of the country after assassination threats and that the plane left him in Saudi Arabia despite orders to wait for him. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges against him</a> [JURIST report] which stem mostly from allegations that he authorized the use of force against protesters during the Tunisian revolution, resulting in more than 200 deaths. <a href="http://www.businessnews.com.tn/details_article.php?t=525&a=23107&temp=1&lang=">Justice Minister Lazhar Karoui Chebbi</a> [profile, in French] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-former-president.php">issuance of an arrest warrant</a> for Ben Ali in January, though the country has not received a response to its <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tunisia-calls-for-saudi-arabia-to-extradite-ousted-president.php">request to extradite</a> [JURIST reports] the former leader from Saudi Arabia, where he remains in exile. The uprisings in Tunisia and ousting of Ben Ali were the beginning of similar uprisings across the Middle East also resulting in the ousting of former Egypt president <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>].

<p>Chebbi announced that Ben Ali had been charged with <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/tunisia-charges-ousted-president-with-protester-abuse.php">18 offenses</a> in April. The announcement came a little over a month after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] called for the Tunisian transitional government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-tunisia-protester-abuses.php">investigate incidents of police violence</a> against protesters and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hrw-calls-for-end-to-police-violence-in-tunisia-protests.php">end police brutality</a> [JURIST reports]. In January, the Tunisian Constitutional Council officially announced that Ben Ali had permanently left the office of the presidency after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] amid nationwide protests, banning public gatherings and allowing police to fire on anyone refusing to obey orders, and fled the country. The leader of the lower house of parliament, Foued Mebezza, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">assumed power as interim president</a> [JURIST report] and is expected to remain in power until elections are held, which <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE70D0MT20110114">Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi</a> [Reuters profile] has indicated will be within the next several months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The results of last week's referendum show that 68 percent of the voters <a href="http://ph.news.yahoo.com/liechtenstein-yes-vote-civil-partnerships-220243116.html">supported</a> [AFP report] the Civil Partnership Act. The <a href="http://www.landtag.li/">Liechtensten Parliament</a> [official website, in German] <a href="http://www.vaterland.li/index.cfm?source=lv&id=12910">unanimously approved the law</a> [<em>Vaterland</em> report, in German] on March 16, but opponents of the civil partnership law, <a href="http://vox-populi.li/">Vox Populi</a> [official website, in German], called for a national referendum. The new law will confer the same tax, inheritance and welfare rights that married couples in Liechtenstein receive, but excludes the right to adoption. The law is scheduled to go into effect on September 1, 2011.

<p>Liechtenstein joins a growing contingent of countries and US States that recognize same-sex partnerships as either full marriage or civil unions and partnerships. The <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br">Supreme Federal Court of Brazil</a> [official website, in Portuguese] unanimously <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=178931">recognized legal rights</a> [press release, in Portugese; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/brazil-supreme-court-recognizes-same-sex-civil-unions.php">report</a>] for partners in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22civil%20union%22">same-sex civil unions</a> [JURIST news archive], though Hungary added a <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">prohibition against gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] to its Constitution one month earlier. Ireland, which legalized homosexuality in 1993, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/ireland-passes-civil-partnership-bill.php">passed a civil partnership bill</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 extending rights to same-sex couples. Although a <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/greece-court-invalidates-first-same-sex.php">Greek court invalidated</a> in May 2009 the first same-sex marriages performed in country, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-parliament-passes-same-sex.php">Swedish parliament passed a same-sex marriage law</a> in April [JURIST reports]. In December 2008, <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/hungary-court-strikes-down-same-sex.php">Hungary struck down</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex partnership law by alleging that it would diminish the importance of marriage. In November 2008, the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/australia-senate-passes-bills-giving.php">Australian Senate approved</a> [JURIST report] a same-sex equal rights law but did not grant the right to marry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a speech before citizens at Damascus University, al-Assad said he wanted citizen input with respect to a new constitution in the form of a national referendum. Al-Assad spent much of his speech addressing an alleged conspiracy, contending that a group of terrorists was responsible for the vandalism, robberies and murders that have taken place since protests erupted in the country early this year, and that he planned to prosecute and hold those individuals accountable. He also said that foreign political entities pressure Syria and interfere with Syrian affairs for their own benefit, and he accused the media of inciting violence and getting involved in protests to get better footage. These forces, he said, were antagonistic to Syria's development. Al-Assad called on Syrian citizens to participate in the reform:<blockquote>The people are the most capable of maintaining security. ... I say that based on experience and reality. ... The one who protected the country during the critical years and who are protecting it now are the  people. ... They are the youths who confronted, initiated and implemented. ... [A] state's strength lies in the strength of the people and their strength lies in their dignity and their dignity lies in their freedom and their freedom lies in the  power of their country.</blockquote>"Equality, justice, transparency and honesty are the future headlines which we aspire for our country," al-Assad said.

<p>There has been a major struggle to put an end to Syrian violence since the protests began earlier this year. In June, Syrian and international human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-groups-urge-icc-probe-into-syria-protest-deaths.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the hundreds of civilian deaths during protests against al-Assad. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], in an emergency special session in April, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4dbfe77d2.pdf">publicly condemned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">report</a>] the violence used by Syrian authorities against peaceful protesters. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-rights-chief-urges-halt-to-syria-killings.php">called for Syria to immediately halt the killings</a> [JURIST report] and violence against civilian protesters in response to the fatal shootings of peaceful anti-government protesters. Also in April, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-ends-48-year-emergency-rule.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] the country's 48-year-old state of emergency, but protests have continued. Earlier in the same month, <a  href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/04/12/syria-security-forces-barring-protesters-medical-care">reported</a> [text] that Syrian security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/syria-forces-preventing-access-to-medical-care-for-protesters-hrw.php">stopped medical personnel</a> [JURIST report], sometimes violently, from attending to injured protesters. Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-for-repression-of-protestors.php">urged the Syrian government</a> [JURIST report] in March to ensure protesters' rights to peaceful expression and to work toward addressing their concerns instead of responding with violence. As demonstrations continued throughout the country in March, the government <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/1119018/1/.html">freed 260 political detainees</a> [AFP report] in an overture to the protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rogers</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-argument-in-miranda-right-to-counsel-cases.php">report</a>] that an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to counsel in civil contempt cases that might result in imprisonment. The court held, however, that this particular defendant's due process rights were violated because he received neither counsel nor access to alternative procedures at his contempt hearing, even though the Due Process Clause of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text] does not necessarily confer the right to counsel in civil cases. The petitioner, Michael Turner, was found to be in civil contempt for failure to pay court-ordered child support payments and was sentenced to 12 months in prison. Turner appealed his sentence, arguing that the court should have provided him with counsel because there was a possibility he would face imprisonment. The respondents first argued that the case is moot because Turner had already finished his 12-month sentence prior to civil litigation. The court ruled, however, that the case is not moot because it falls within a special category of disputes that are "capable of repetition" while "evading review." The court noted that, in determining whether a defendant's due process rights are violated in similar civil contempt actions, a court must consider the defendant's ability to pay child support, whether the opposing party is the government or the custodial parent unrepresented by counsel, and whether there are substitute procedural safeguards in place. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, emphasized the importance of a defendant's due process rights:<blockquote>The "private interest that will be affected" argues strongly for the right to counsel that Turner advocates. That interest consists of an indigent defendant's loss of personal liberty through imprisonment. The interest in securing that freedom, the freedom "from bodily restraint," lies "at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause." And we have made clear that its threatened loss through legal proceedings demands "due process protection."</blockquote>The majority vacated the lower court's ruling and remanded for further consistent proceedings.

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justices John Roberts, Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito, stressed that neither the Fourteenth nor <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentvi">Sixth Amendments</a> [text] confer the right to counsel in civil cases. He also pointed out that the court should not have reached the issue of whether Turner's contempt hearing violated Due Process because that issue was never raised by either party prior to the filing of amicus briefs. Finally, Thomas noted that he would not engage in the majority's balancing test because state legislatures have made their own policy judgments regarding the enforcement of child support laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-218.htm">PPL Montana v. Montana</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Pet.10-218.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine if the proper constitutional test for whether a river is navigable for title purposes requires a trial court to consider whether the river was considered navigable at the time the state joined the Union or whether the court can consider new evidence based on current use. The challenge is being brought by a company that owns a hydroelectric power dam on the Missouri River after the Supreme Court of Montana <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/OpBelow.PPlMT_.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the title to the riverbeds passed to Montana when it became a state in 1889 and that the riverbeds are public trust lands under Article X, Section 11. The Supreme Court of Montana ordered PPL to pay $41 million in back rent and more in future rent for use of the riverbeds. Last November, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-juvenile-miranda-rights.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] the acting solicitor general to submit views on the case.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-708.htm">First American Financial v. Edwards</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Brief-01-13-11-173502.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide whether a plaintiff has standing to sue, on behalf of a nationwide class, claiming a real estate company violated the <a href="http://portal.hud.gov:80/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/rmra/res/respa_st">Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974</a> [text] without claiming that the violation affected the services rendered. RESPA makes it illegal for settlement service companies to receive a kickback involving any federally related mortgage loan. The plaintiff argues that her title agent improperly referred her to <a href="http://www.firstam.com/">First American Financial</a> [corporate website] in violation of RESPA seeking to recover settlement service charges despite not showing that First American Financial was more expensive or provided inadequate service. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Brief-01-13-11-173502.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the payment of he service charges established an injury in fact sufficient to satisfy Article III standing because RESPA's text does not limit liability to cases where the plaintiff is overcharged.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1150.htm">Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Brief-05-31-11-095248.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will here a case over the ability to patent under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_101.htm">35 USC &#167; 101</a> [text] the observed correlations between natural metabolite reactions of the body to different dosages of a certain type of drug. <a href="http://www.prometheuslabs.com/">Prometheus Labs</a> [corporate website] patented the tests doctors use for determining the appropriate dosage of drugs for treating Crohn's disease and other autoimmune diseases. Mayo Collaborative argues that the tests look at "natural phenomenon" and that doctors violate the patents simply by mentally recognizing the correlation regardless of what the doctor does with this knowledge. The Supreme Court accepted a case on this issue before in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/labvmet.html">Laboratory Corp. of America v. Metabolite Laboratories</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/supreme-court-hears-patent-case.php">report</a>] but dismissed it as "improvidently granted" because the petitioner had not adequately preserved the question.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1024.htm">Federal Aviation Administration v. Cooper</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/osg/briefs/2010/2pet/7pet/2010-1024.pet.aa.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the Supreme Court will decide whether a pilot who lost his license for a failure to disclose he had HIV can sue the federal government for mental and emotional damages. The pilot, Stanmore Cooper, did not tell the <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) that he had HIV but did disclose it to the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Administration </a>(SSA) [official websites] in order to receive disability benefits. This fact was discovered during a government investigation to streamline agencies. Coopers pilots' license was revoked after a determination that he would not have been medically certified to fly if it was known he had HIV. Cooper admitted to delivering a false writing and was sentenced to a fine and probation. Cooper is suing the government claiming that the sharing of documents between the two agencies during the investigation violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552---a000-.html">Privacy Act of 1974</a> [5 USC &#167; 552a] seeking "actual damages" for mental and emotional distress. But the government claims the Privacy Act's "actual damages" does not cover such distress. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10323505693202904826&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">held</a> [opinion text] the SSA violated the Privacy Act and that the Cooper could sue for emotional distress damages. Justice Elena Kagan, former solicitor general for the US, recused herself from consideration of this case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Connecticut</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-global-warming-case.php">report</a>] that the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> [text] displace claims made under the federal common law of nuisance regarding whether electric utilities contributed to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22global+warming%22">global warming</a> [JURIST news archive]. The court ruled that at least one plaintiff had standing by an equally divided court as Justice Sonia Sotomayor did not take part in the decision. On the merits, all eight justices agreed in rejecting the claims by eight states, New York City, and three private land trusts brought invoking the federal common law for public nuisance against four power companies and the <a href="http://www.tva.gov/">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (TVA) [official website]. The plaintiffs sought to control greenhouse gas emissions by creating a annually declining cap on emissions. The court held that to challenge greenhouse gas emissions the plaintiffs may file petitions for rulemaking with the EPA to set emissions standards. Currently, the EPA is undergoing rulemaking on the issue and is set to issue new standards by May 2012. The court said: <blockquote>It is altogether fitting that Congress designated an expert agency, here, EPA, as best suited to serve as primary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions. The expert agency is surely better equipped to do the job than individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case injunctions. Federal judges lack the scientific, economic, and technological resources an agency can utilize in coping with issues of this order. Judges may not commission scientific studies or convene groups of experts for advice, or issue rules under notice-and-comment procedures inviting input by any interested person, or seek the counsel of regulators in the States where the defendants are located. Rather, judges are confined by a record comprising the evidence the parties present. Moreover, federal district judges, sitting as sole adjudicators, lack authority to render precedential decisions binding other judges, even members of the same court. </blockquote> In <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2006/masvenv.html">Massachusetts v. EPA</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in_29.php">report</a>] the court found that the EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act and its failure to set applicable standards without reason was no in accordance with law. 

<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in 2009 that <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/second-circuit-rules-states-may-sue.php">states can sue power companies for emitting carbon dioxide</a>, reversing a district court <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/environmental-brief-federal-judge.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] that found the plaintiffs' claim was a non-justiciable political question. The lawsuit was brought by eight states&#8212;California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin&#8212;as well as New York City and three land trusts, against coal-burning utilities <a href="http://www.aep.com/">American Electric Power</a>, <a href="http://www.southerncompany.com/">Southern Company</a>, <a href="http://www.xcelenergy.com/Company/Pages/Home.aspx">Xcel Energy</a>, <a href="http://www.duke-energy.com/residential.asp">Cinergy Corporation</a> [corporate websites] and the TVA].

Dukes</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-walmart-class-action-witness-tampering-law.php">report</a>] that a group of women seeking to recover damages from Wal-Mart failed to meet the requirements for class certification. The case, a <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm">Title VII</a> [text] gender discrimination class action lawsuit estimated to include more than 1.5 million women, was filed in 2001 by <a href="http://www.walmartclass.com/public_home.html">female Wal-Mart employees</a> [class website] who contend that Wal-Mart's nationwide policies result in lower pay for women than men in comparable positions and longer waits for management promotions than men. Wal-Mart <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/wal-mart-appeals-class-action-certification-to-supreme-court.php">appealed</a> to the Supreme Court in August after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/ninth-circuit-affirms-class.php">upheld class certification</a> [JURIST reports] in April. The Supreme Court held that the class action did not satisfy <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/Rule23.htm">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(2)</a> [text], which requires a class to prove that class members have common "questions of law or fact." The court distinguished between an employee's claim that she was individually discriminated against and a claim that the company has a policy of discriminating against a class of individuals:<blockquote>Quite obviously, the mere claim by employees of the same company that they have suffered a Title VII injury, or even a disparate-impact Title VII injury, gives no cause to believe that all their claims can productively be litigated at once. Their claims must depend upon a common contention&#8212;for example, the assertion of discriminatory bias on the part of the same supervisor. That common contention, moreover, must be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution&#8212;which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.</blockquote>The plaintiffs failed to provide "significant proof" that Wal-Mart's promotion program, though granting wide discretionary authority to store management, "operated under a general policy of discrimination." Wal-Mart also claimed that class certification was improper under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2), which does not authorize certification of claims seeking monetary relief, because the class sought primarily monetary compensation in the form of back pay. The Supreme Court agreed and ultimately reversed the appeal court ruling.

<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, along with Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, concurred in part and dissented in part. Ginsburg argued that the majority conflates the 23(a) commonality requirement with the 23(b)(3) "predominance" criteria, a much higher standard to satisfy. She wrote that the class does in fact satisfy 23(a)'s threshold requirements but fails to meet the 23(b)(2) certification category. The issue of whether the class satisfies 23(b)(3), Ginsburg said, is a matter that should be left to the lower court on remand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Guarnieri</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-retaliation-protection-attorneys-fees.php">report</a>] that state and local government employees may not sue their employers for retaliation under the <a href="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/petition/overview.aspx">Petition Clause</a> [FAC backgrounder] of the First Amendment when they petition the government on matters of private concern. To show that an employer interfered with rights under the Speech Clause of the First Amendment, an employee must show that his speech related to a matter of public concern. The court held that this test also applies when the employee invokes the Petition Clause. Respondent Charles Guarnieri filed a union grievance after being terminated as chief of police for the borough of Duryea. An arbitrator found that the borough council committed procedural errors and ordered that Guarnieri be reinstated as chief of police. The council instituted several directives that Guarnieri complained lacked a "warm welcome feeling," a complaint that the court deemed "private." Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, indicated that using one test for both the Speech and Petition Clauses of the First Amendment is appropriate:<blockquote>Articulation of a separate test for the Petition Clause would aggravate potential harm to the government's interests by compounding the costs of compliance with the Constitution. A different rule for each First Amendment claim would require employers to separate petitions from other speech in order to afford them different treatment; and that, in turn, would add to the complexity and expense of compliance with the Constitution.</blockquote>Because respondent Charles Guarnieri's petition was related to a matter of private concern, the Supreme Court reversed the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruling.

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia disagreed with the majority with respect to the "public concern" requirement, stating that the doctrine "frustrates the principal purpose of the Petition Clause." Scalia also would have held that the Petition Clause does not apply to petitions directed to the government acting as the petitioner's employer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The groups claim Secure Communities undermines public safety, invites racial profiling and pulls non-citizens into what they call a "dangerous" system of detention and deportation. ICE <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/ice-reforms-secure-communities-program/2011/06/17/AGMJkaZH_story.html">announced changes</a> [WSJ report] Friday to its program that requires local law enforcement to turn over fingerprints to federal immigration officials after booking arrested individuals to check for immigration violations. The changes include the creation of an Advisory Committee and Minor Traffic Offenses to provide recommendations on how to focus on those illegal immigrants who pose a legitimate threat to public safety. ICE also issued a <a href="http://www.ice.gov/doclib/secure-communities/pdf/prosecutorial-discretion-memo.pdf">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] promoting prosecutorial discretion by looking at considerations such as the individual's length of time in the US, whether they are pursuing an education and their prior immigration history. The rights groups said they commend ICE for trying to make changes in response to an outcry against the program but called the changes merely "cosmetic." 

<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/DefaultE.htm">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> (IACH) [official website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-criticizes-us-immigrant-detention-system.php">report</a> [JURIST report] arguing that US immigration enforcement agencies are overly reliant on a flawed detention system. The IACH investigated six immigrant detention centers based throughout Arizona and Texas. The report expressed concern over increased use of detention by the US government, citing a doubling in detention of non-citizens by ICE.  It criticized the US government for viewing detention as a necessity and not as an exception in its enforcement. Absent comprehensive reform at the federal level, illegal immigration continues to be a concern for local governments as well. There are currently federal court challenges over preemption of state immigration bills passed by <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Oklahoma Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/oklahoma-high-court-upholds-most-of-state-immigration-law.php">upheld an immigration law</a> [JURIST report] authorizing law enforcement to use concurrent authority with the federal government to control illegal immigration, preventing illegal immigrants from receiving drivers' licenses or state-issued ID cards, making illegal immigrants ineligible for state assistance, and requiring employers to check the immigration status of its employees. Last month, the US <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href = "/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] ruled in <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v.

The two were <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/20/zine-el-abidine-ben-ali-former-tunisia-president-jail-sentence-_n_880696.html">sentenced to 35 years in prison</a> [Reuters report] and fined USD $65.6 million. The sentencing came just hours after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/trial-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-begins-in-absentia.php">trial  began</a> [JURIST report]. The two were also charged with illegal possession of drugs and weapons, but the verdict for those charges would not be announced until June 30. Ben Ali fled Tunisia to Saudi Arabia in January during protests against his 23-year autocratic rule in which his <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE75J0MI20110620?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">family amassed substantial wealth</a> [Reuters report] that many Tunisians say was at their expense. But Ben Ali said Monday that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=">he was "duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis, according to a statement released through his lawyer. He said that he was trying to get his family out of the country after assassination threats and that the plane left him in Saudi Arabia despite orders to wait for him. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges against him</a> [JURIST report] which stem mostly from allegations that he authorized the use of force against protesters during the Tunisian revolution, resulting in more than 200 deaths. <a href="http://www.businessnews.com.tn/details_article.php?t=525&amp;a=23107&amp;temp=1&amp;lang=">Justice Minister Lazhar Karoui Chebbi</a> [profile, in French] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-issues-international-arrest-warrant-for-former-president.php">issuance of an arrest warrant</a> for Ben Ali in January, though the country has not received a response to its <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/tunisia-calls-for-saudi-arabia-to-extradite-ousted-president.php">request to extradite</a> [JURIST reports] the former leader from Saudi Arabia, where he remains in exile. The uprisings in Tunisia and ousting of Ben Ali were the beginning of similar uprisings across the Middle East also resulting in the ousting of former Egypt president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>].

<p>Chebbi announced that Ben Ali had been charged with <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/tunisia-charges-ousted-president-with-protester-abuse.php">18 offenses</a> in April. The announcement came a little over a month after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] called for the Tunisian transitional government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-tunisia-protester-abuses.php">investigate incidents of police violence</a> against protesters and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hrw-calls-for-end-to-police-violence-in-tunisia-protests.php">end police brutality</a> [JURIST reports]. In January, the Tunisian Constitutional Council officially announced that Ben Ali had permanently left the office of the presidency after he <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-declares-state-of-emergency-leaves-office.php">declared a state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] amid nationwide protests, banning public gatherings and allowing police to fire on anyone refusing to obey orders, and fled the country. The leader of the lower house of parliament, Foued Mebezza, <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">assumed power as interim president</a> [JURIST report] and is expected to remain in power until elections are held, which <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/tunisiaNews/idAFLDE70D0MT20110114">Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi</a> [Reuters profile] has indicated will be within the next several months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Plaintiff <a href="http://www.wifamilyaction.org/">Wisconsin Family Action</a> [advocacy website] challenged the <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0770.pdf">Domestic Partnership Registry</a> [Wisc. Stats. 770 text, PDF] as unconstitutional pursuant to the Marriage Amendment of Wisconsin's <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/wisconst.pdf">Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. Dane County Circuit Judge Daniel Moeser granted summary judgment to defendant <a href="http://fairwisconsin.com/">Fair Wisconsin</a> [advocacy website], finding that the defendant had made a <em>prima facie</em> case. Moeser indicated that, based on plain language, constitutional debates, and earliest interpretations by the legislature, the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=domestic+partnership">domestic partnership</a> [JURIST news archive] legal status is not "substantially similar" to marriage such that the Marriage Amendment preempts the same-sex domestic partnership designation:<blockquote>[T]he sum total of domestic partners' legal rights, duties, and liabilities is not identical or so essentially alike that it is virtually identical to the sum total of spouses' legal rights, duties, and liabilities. The state does not recognize domestic partnership in a way that mirrors how the state recognizes marriage. Moreover, the state confers drastically different benefits, rights, and responsibilities to domestic partners solely by virtue of their domestic partnership status in comparison to the benefits, rights, and responsibilities given to spouses because of their marriage status.</blockquote>Though the registry does not bestow equal rights to individuals in civil partnerships and marriages, it grants same-sex couples legal rights including hospital visitation, end of life decision, and property inheritance rights. Republican <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> and <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> (R) [official websites] have refused to defend the registry.

<p>Several states have addressed same-sex domestic partnership and civil union laws in recent years. Hawaii <a href="http://hawaii.gov/gov/about/governors-bio">Governor Neil Abercrombie</a> (D) [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-governor-signs-same-sex-unions-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2011/bills/SB232_HD1_.pdf">same-sex civil unions bill</a> [SB 232 text, PDF] into law in February, legalizing same-sex civil unions in the state. That same month, Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing same-sex civil unions. Washington voters <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">narrowly approved</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://wei.secstate.wa.gov/osos/en/PreviousElections/2009/GeneralElection/Pages/OVG_20091103.aspx#ososTop">Referendum 71</a> (R-71) [text], expanding the state's domestic partnership law in November 2009.

Sanader's lawyers said that the former prime minister dropped the appeal after media speculation suggesting the appeal process <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15175038,00.html">could tarnish Croatian accession</a> [DW report] to the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. Sanader is currently being held in Austria. The Salzburg Provincial Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/austria-court-rules-croatia-ex-prime-minister-can-be-extradited.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May that Sanader's extradition of could proceed. Sanader was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/croatia-ex-pm-arrested-on-suspicion-of-corruption-fraud.php">arrested by Austrian officials</a> [JURIST report] in December on charges of abuse of power, corruption and fraud for taking nearly <a target="_blank" href="http://www.croatiantimes.com/news/General_News/2010-12-10/15781/Sanader_facing_several_charges_of_fraud">&#8364;4 million from public firms and state institutions</a> [<em>Croatian Times</em> report]. Counsel for Sanader announced that they would <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15062173,00.html">immediately appeal</a> [DW report] the ruling to the High Provincial Court in Linz and argued that it would be impossible for Sanader to receive a fair trial in Croatia. Croatian <a target="_blank" href="http://www.predsjednik.hr/PRESIDENT">President Ivo Josipovic</a> [official website] said that Sanader would be entitled to a fair trial.

<p>Croatian officials have been under serious pressure to the tackle the issue of corruption in order to gain <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/croatia/index_en.htm">accession</a> [EU materials] to the EU by 2012. On the same day Sanader was arrested, former interior ministry official Tomislav Mercep was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/top-croatia-official-arrested-for-war-crimes.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] on charges of committing war crimes. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGPRE201012081974&amp;lang=e">press release</a>] calling for the prosecution of individuals responsible for war crimes the day before Mercep's arrest. In November, a Croatian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/croatia-court-sentences-6-men-for-2008-death-of-journalist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six men to 15 to 40 years in prison for their roles in the killing of a Croatian journalist in 2008. In 2008, AI called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ICTY">news archive</a>] investigating war crimes in the area. The entry talks were resumed in October of that year after the ICTY declared that Croatia was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/icty-says-croatia-now-cooperating-on.php">fully cooperating</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pentagon general counsel <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=173">Jeh Johnson</a> and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/meet-olc.html">Caroline Krass</a> [official profiles] acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel told the President that they believed that US activities in Libya constituted "hostilities" under the War Powers Resolution. Under such an interpretation, US forces would have to have been pulled out by May 20 without further authorization from Congress. The president however, relied on the interpretations of White House counsel <a href="http://www.perkinscoie.com/rbauer/">Robert Bauer</a> [professional profile] and State Department legal advisor <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/143262.htm">Harold Koh</a> [official profile] in determining that US activities did not amount to "hostilities" because they are only playing a supporting role in the NATO-led mission pursuant to and limited by the UN Security Council Resolution authorizing military action in Libya to protect civilians. Usually, interpretations of the Office of Legal Counsel are the last word, but the president does have the authority to override them. After threats to defund the operations from Congress, a group of 37 conservative leaders, including former deputy assistant secretary of state Liz Cheney, former deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz, and former Bush administration advisor Karl Rove, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/conservatives-warn-house-republicans-not-to-defund-libyan-mission/2011/06/20/AGqgcNdH_blog.html">sent an open letter</a> [WSJ report, letter text] to House Republicans Monday urging them not to cut funding:<blockquote>Such a decision would be an abdication of our responsibilities as an ally and as the leader of the Western alliance. It would result in the perpetuation in power of a ruthless dictator who has ordered terrorist attacks on the United States in the past, has pursued nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and who can be expected to return to these activities should he survive. To cut off funding for current efforts would, in short, be profoundly contrary to American interests. ... The United States should be leading in this effort, not trailing behind our allies. We should be doing more to help the Libyan opposition, which deserves our support. We should not be allowing ourselves to be held hostage to UN Security Council resolutions and irresolute allies.</blockquote> Last week, Speaker of the House <a href = "http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/boehner-obama-has-not-sufficiently-answered-questions-on-libya/2011/06/17/AGbDmaZH_blog.html">threatened</a> [WSJ report] that the House would defund operations in Libya arguing that it is outside the president's authority. Still, Obama's action <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jL7RHZ1YrLLug-KYso6Qde9hkQ9A?docId=f32ccb3fc5bb41b3b51c85bc16726340">found support</a> [AP report] from outgoing Defense Secretary <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Robert Gates</a> [official profile] who called US activities "a limited kinetic operation."

<p>Last week, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-releases-report-justifying-actions-and-cost-in-libya.php">released a report defending the legality of US operations</a> [JURIST report] in Libya in a report released in response to recent criticisms of American intervention in Libya, including: a <a href = "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:292:./list/bss/d112HE.lst::">resolution</a> [bill materials] passed in the <a href = "http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] calling for withdrawal without congressional approval; a <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=246444">letter</a> [text]  to Obama from Boehner warning that he was within five days of violating the War Powers Resolution; and Representatives <a href="http://kucinich.house.gov">Dennis Kucinich</a> (D-OH) and <a href="http://jones.house.gov">Walter Jones</a> (R-NC) [official websites] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/lawmakers-file-suit-against-obama-for-continuing-actions-in-libya.php">filing a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking an injunction on the Libya action.

The Puerto Montt court approved three petitions challenging government authorization of the dam construction and granted the plaintiffs' petition for injunction. The plaintiffs allege that the project's approval process was rife with conflicts of interest and tainted by Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpete, who intervened in the approval deliberation process. Authorities also allegedly overlooked negative reports about the project by various government agencies. Senate President Guido Girardi, opponent of the dam project, said the approval process was <a href="http://www.latercera.com/noticia/nacional/2011/06/680-374493-9-ecologistas-emplazan-al-gobierno-a-paralizar-definitivamente-hidroaysen.shtml">arbitrary and guided by corporate entities</a> [<em>La Tercera</em> report, in Spanish], and that the project was not in the country's interest.

Recent polls indicate that over 74 percent of the Chilean population are opposed to the dam project. Plebiscites, or citizen petition initiatives, are being conducted in several small towns to change local land-use ordinances in an effort combat further approval of the dam project. Chileans took to the streets and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13445300">protested the project</a> [BBC report] in May arguing that "the dams will have dramatically negative effects on an important wilderness."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Minister of Justice Judge Tayseer Qala Awwad said the decree pardons those serving sentences who are suffering with terminal illnesses except for serious crimes such as smuggling arms and narcotics. However, Awwad said that some of the most serious felonies against individuals and society were not covered in the pardon. Also, the amnesty does not apply to cases where there is a private prosecution or personal claim against individual. This is the second amnesty decree al-Assad has issued in the past three weeks in attempt to defuse the now 13-week uprising pushing for al-Assad to either institute reforms or step down. On Tuesday, tens of thousands took part in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2006243/Syrian-government-announces-amnesty-crimes-committed-violent-protests.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">pro-government rallies</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] in Syrian cities, but critics claimed that the rallies were composed of government service workers forced to attend wearing civilian clothing. 

<p>On Monday, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/syria-president-promises-reform-alleges-conspiracy.php">made a much-hyped speech</a> [JURIST report] at Damascus University where he announced that he would soon introduce reforms and present a new constitution, but he spent much of the speech claiming that the protests were part of a conspiracy against Syria. He contends that a group of terrorists is responsible for the vandalism, robberies and murders that have taken place since protests erupted in the country early this year, and said that he planned to prosecute and hold those individuals accountable. Earlier this month, al-Assad <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/syria-president-grants-amnesty-for-political-prisoners.php">granted amnesty to political prisoners</a> [JURIST report] including all members of the previously banned <a href="http://www.ikhwanweb.com/articles.php?pid=10005">Muslim Brotherhood</a> (MB) [party website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Muslim+Brotherhood">news archive</a>]. But opposition leaders dismissed the move and met in Turkey to discuss Syria's future. Syria has come under international scrutiny for using force to suppress the protests across the country. Earlier this month, the UN expressed concern over violence in Syria and urged the Syrian government to stop using force against protesters. Also, Syrian and international human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-groups-urge-icc-probe-into-syria-protest-deaths.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to investigate the hundreds of civilian deaths during protests against al-Assad.Nearly 1,200 people have been killed and 10,000 displaced since protests erupted in February. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit has been underway for 15 years, with a federal judge approving of the <a href="http://missoulian.com/news/national/article_a9cc2be8-bd77-599e-97a1-72c983b10013.html">most expensive class-action settlement against the US government</a> [AP report] ever approved. The <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> (DOI) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] applauded the settlement reached between American Indians and the US government. <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Interior Secretary Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] stated that "Judge Hogan's decision is another milestone in empowerment and reconciliation for the American Indians." Plaintiff Elouise Cobell delivered a statement for the hearing through the phone, from her home in Montana. Cobell <a href="http://kgvo1290.com/elouise-cobell-statement-at-fairness-hearing/">stated</a> [statement]: <blockquote>The terms of settlement bring a measure of justice to some of the most vulnerable people in this country. The settlement isn't perfect. I do not think it compensates all for all the losses sustained, but I do think it is fair and it is reasonable. That is what matters&#8212;a fair resolution has been achieved. I am convinced that it is the best settlement possible. I am convinced also that if this settlement failed, there would be many more years of litigation with little possibility of a more favorable resolution.</blockquote> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/06/20/statement-president-approval-cobell-settlement-us-senior-district-judge-">expressed hope</a> [statement] that this settlement will improve the relationship between the US government and American Indians and promised to "engage in government-to-government consultations" with the tribes over the land consolidation part of the settlement.

<p>In October 2010, Hogan <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-extends-deadline-for-congress-to-approve-indian-trust-settlement.php">extended the deadline</a> [JURIST report] for Congress to approve the $3.4 billion settlement concerning the US government's alleged <a href="http://www.doi.gov/archive/indiantrust.html">mismanagement of funds</a> [DOI materials] held in trust for American Indian landowners. Hogan set a new deadline for January 7, 2011, reasoning that this would allow the lame-duck session of Congress a final chance to approve the settlement. This is the seventh time an extension has been granted since the settlement was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/obama-administration-announces-34.php">agreed upon</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. The House of Representatives has twice approved the settlement, but the US Senate, which will reconvene on November 15, has yet to vote on the issue. Hogan urged Congress to accept the settlement and meet the January extension, warning that costly litigation for both parties would follow further delay. The plaintiffs had <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/indian-trust-plaintiffs-reject-7.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a $7 billion settlement offer in 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A settlement was reached when JPMorgan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/21/us-jpmorgan-sec-settlement-idUSTRE75K5A420110621">agreed to pay</a> [Reuters report] a $133 million fine, in addition to $20.6 million for fraudulent profits and interest. This settlement is one of the most significant lawsuits against Wall Street for its role in the mortgage crisis. The press release stated:<blockquote>The SEC alleges that J.P. Morgan structured and marketed a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) without informing investors that a hedge fund helped select the assets in the CDO portfolio and had a short position in more than half of those assets. As a result, the hedge fund was poised to benefit if the CDO assets it was selecting for the portfolio defaulted.</blockquote>At this time, no individual bankers are being charged in the JPMorgan case.

<p>In July 2010, <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=goldman+sachs">news archive</a>] agreed to a <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/consent-pr2010-123.pdf">$550 million settlement</a> [text, PDF] with the SEC to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/goldman-sachs-reaches-record-550-million-settlement-with-sec.php">resolve charges</a> [JURIST report] that they marketed a subprime mortgage product and made misleading statements and omissions to investors in early 2007. Of the $550 million settlement, $300 million will be paid to the US Treasury and $250 million will be distributed to harmed investors. The penalty was the largest against a financial company in SEC history. In May 2010, <a href="http://www.lehmanbrothers.com/">Lehman Brothers Holdings</a> [corporate website] filed <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/lehmansuit0526.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/lehman-brothers-sues-jpmorgan-for-billions-over-collapse.php">report</a>] against JPMorgan for allegedly "siphoning" off billions of dollars in "critically-needed" assets days before the investment bank filed for a record-breaking bankruptcy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

An electrical substation at the base of 7 World Trade Center (7WTC) was destroyed when the building collapsed during the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attack. The substation was operated by <a href="http://www.coned.com/">Con Edison</a> [corporate website], a company that leased property from the Port Authority. Con Edison brought the action against PANYNJ for negligence in construction and design and breach of contract in 2002, arguing that the diesel fuel tanks PANYNJ had improperly allowed its tenants to use <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/21/us-wtc-negligence-idUSTRE75K61120110621">accelerated the building's collapse</a> [Reuters report]. The <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] granted summary judgment to PANYNJ, and Con Edison appealed. The appeals court reversed the lower court decision, indicating Con Edison's negligence claim was proper because it arose out of the Port Authority's "independent duty, as owner of the leased premises, to exercise reasonable care to avoid damage to persons or property thereon." The appeals court did, however, agree with the lower court's ruling that the lease agreement between the two companies provided only for no-fault reimbursement related to damage caused by active construction or maintenance of the building. The appeals court remanded the negligence claim for further consistent proceedings.

<p>PANYNJ is also battling a lawsuit related to a separate terror attack. In June, PANYNJ <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/summaries/Daily/June%201.pdf">argued in an appeal</a> [case summary, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-court-hears-appeal-on-liability-for-1993-world-trade-center-attack.php">report</a>] before the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov">New York Court of Appeals</a> [official website] that they were not liable for negligence in the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2008/february/tradebom_022608">1993 WTC attacks</a> [FBI backgrounger; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/26/newsid_2516000/2516469.stm">backgrounder</a>]. The Port Authority seeks to overturn the <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2008/2008_03991.htm">2008 decision</a> [text] that upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/ny-port-authority-found-negligent-in.php">2005 jury verdict</a> [JURIST report] apportioning 68 percent of the fault to the Port Authority and 32 percent to the terrorists who committed the attack. The 1993 bombing of the WTC by Islamic radicals killed six and injured 1,000 through a car bomb placed in the basement parking garage. Five men were captured and sentenced to life in prison for the attack. After the bombing, 648 plaintiffs filed 174 negligence actions against the Port Authority for "alleged breach of its proprietary duty to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition." Negligence was assessed against the Port Authority after documents revealed that the WTC garage had been ignoring safety fears since 1984. The Port Authority police superintendent, at the time, stated the parking areas "[we]re accessible to the public and are highly susceptible to car bombings." </p>]]></content:encoded>

A trial court in the city of Beja <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/politics/3467-sofiane-ben-ali-sentenced-in-absentia-to-15-years-in-jail-for-issuing-uncovered-cheques.html">issued the cumulative sentence</a> [TAP report] against Sofiane Ben Ali for multiple cases in which he wrote bad checks totaling more than USD $430,000. Tunisia has been cracking down on the family of Ben Ali since the ousted president fled the country in January amidst protests ending his 23-year autocratic rule in which his family amassed substantial wealth that many Tunisians say was at their expense. On Saturday, a Tunisian court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/07/us-tunisia-leader-nephew-idUSTRE74629A20110507">convicted the nephew of Ben Ali's wife</a> [Reuters report], businessman Imed Trabelsi, and sentenced him to two years in jail for drug use. He had admitted to using drugs before but said he had not used since 2000. He was arrested after Ben Ali fled the country to Saudi Arabia in January. 

<p>On Monday of this week, Ben Ali and his wife were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-35-years-in-absentia.php">convicted <em>in absentia</em></a> and sentenced to 35 years in prison on charges of theft and unlawful possession of money and jewelry after only an hours-long trial that <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/trial-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-begins-in-absentia.php">began that morning</a> [JURIST reports]. The two were also charged with illegal possession of drugs and weapons, but the verdict for those charges would not be announced until June 30. Ben Ali said <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=">he was "duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis, according to a statement released through his lawyer. He said that he was trying to get his family out of the country after assassination threats and that the plane left him in Saudi Arabia despite orders to wait for him. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges against him</a> [JURIST report] more of which stem from allegations he authorized the use of force against protesters during the protests, resulting in more than 200 deaths.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN Under-Secretary-General for <a href = "http://www.un.org/en/humanitarian/">Humanitarian Affairs</a> [official website] and Emergency Relief Coordinator <a href = "http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=145">Valerie Amos</a> [official profile] said that the UN knows of more than 70,000 people who have been displaced by the conflict, many of whom are subject to violence and targeting due to their ethnic heritage.<blockquote>I am also concerned that the overall security situation in Sudan is deteriorating at an alarming rate, with severe humanitarian consequences. Civilians are increasingly bearing the brunt of the volatile and uncertain political climate. The conflict has also prevented sowing at the beginning of the agricultural season which will cause food shortages. We could be facing a worst case scenario, with millions of civilians in both North and South Sudan in need of protection and critical humanitarian assistance.</blockquote>Last week, the UN reported that several <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38798&Cr=Kordofan&Cr1=">peacekeepers had been held and tortured</a> [UN News Centre report] in the region, and that those providing humanitarian relief are vulnerable. On Wednesday, US President Barack Obama released a <a href = "http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/06/22/statement-president-sudan">statement praising Sudan</a> [text] for its efforts toward building peace, but also echoing Amos' concerns: "The situation in Southern Kordofan is dire, with deeply disturbing reports of attacks based on ethnicity. The United States condemns all acts of violence, in particular the Sudanese Armed Forces aerial bombardment  of civilians and harassment and intimidation of UN peacekeepers."

<p>South Kordofan is a state in the center of Sudan, and has been a disputed territory between Sudan and South Sudan, due to its oil reserves. South Sudan is scheduled to become independent next month and its forces, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), have held South Kordofan since the 2005 peace deal that stifled Sudan's civil war. Sudan's army, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), took over Abyei, a district in the state in May, causing a <A href = "paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-urges-peaceful-resolution-of-sudan-conflict.php">rebuke</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/un-security-council-demands-removal-of-sudan-troops-from-disputed-region.php">demand for withdrawal</a> [JURIST reports] by the UN. The UN confirmed reports of bombing and shelling in and around Abyei by the SAF, as well as widespread looting and burning of houses. Aid workers <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13549157">estimate 40,000 people have fled the area</a> [BBC report]. While the UN has said that attacks on its peacekeepers amount to war crimes under international law, both the UN and the US have called on the northern troops to withdraw from Abyei. From the northern capital of Khartoum <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/related%20cases/icc02050109/icc02050109?lan=en-GB">ICC case materials</a>; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bashir">news archive</a>] has stated he will not withdraw troops from the region and insisted that the area belongs to the north.

The plaintiffs <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/rights-groups-sue-rumsfeld-over.php">sued in 2005</a> [JURIST report] claiming Rumsfeld and three other high-ranking military officers were directly responsible for violations of the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth Amendments</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Torture Statute</a> (ATS) [28 USC &#167; 1350] for authorizing their illegal detention and torture by US authorities at Bagram Air Force Base and Abu Ghraib. They alleged that Rumsfeld and the officers formed the policies and practices that led to the unlawful conduct and when they had reason to know it was happening failed to take action to stop it. The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in March 2007 holding that government officials had immunity from liability for such conduct overseas. The DC Circuit ruled 2-1 that Rumsfeld and the military officers had qualified immunity from the <span class="casename">Bivens</span> claims for Fifth and Eighth Amendment violations since the plaintiffs did not allege any violations of clearly established law. The plaintiffs argued that the Supreme Court case in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/06-1195">Boumediene v. Bush</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-guantanamo.php">report</a>] established rights for detainees that were violated. But the court said that this was not established law at the time and even if the plaintiffs could claim constitutional violations the court "would decline to sanction a <span class="casename">Bivens</span> cause of action because special factors counsel against doing so." Further, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' ATS claims because they alleged only violations of the law of nations and not a violation of US law to satisfy the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002679----000-.html">Westfall Exception</a> [28 USC &#167; 2679(b)(2)(B)] to civil liability for federal employees. The court said that the ATS is only a jurisdictional statute and thus, does not create a cause of action in of itself. Since the court found no cognizable claim it refused to grant the plaintiffs' request for declaratory relief that Rumsfeld and the officers violated the Constitution, military rules and guidelines, and the law of nations.

<p>Judge Harry Edwards dissented over the dismissal of the plaintiffs' ATS claims. He said, "[i]t is ironic that, under the majority's approach, <em>United States officials</em> who torture a foreign national in a foreign country are not subject to suit in an action brought under section 1350, whereas <em>foreign officials</em> who commit official torture in a foreign country may be sued under section 1350." Rumsfeld has been the target of a number of lawsuits over alleged unlawful detention and torture of suspected terrorists and US enemies. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] appealed a case over two <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees, Yasser Al-Zahrani of Saudi Arabia and Salah Al-Salami of Yemen, who committed suicide while in detention in 2006, claiming the US and 24 government officials including Rumsfeld, are responsible for their arbitrary detention, torture, and deaths. Also this month, US citizen and convicted terrorist <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">Jose Padilla</a> [JURIST news archive], represented by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-appeals-dismissal-of-padilla-unlawful-detention-suit.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against government officials, including Rumsfeld, over his detention in a military prison arguing that he has a valid <span class="casename">Bivens</span> action. Rumsfeld has also faced possible criminal charges in Europe, when, in 2007, a <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/rumsfeld-war-crimes-complaint-filed-in.php">war crimes complaint was filed against him</a> [JURIST report] in Germany for his involvement in detainee treatment. The <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">case was later dismissed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The complaint argues that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. In presenting the complaint, her lawyer, Sergey Vlasenko, said:<blockquote>We ask to recognise that in the process of opening a criminal case against Ms Tymoshenko, during the investigation of criminal charges there has been a violation of sub-paragraph C of paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which suggests that a person can be detained only given sufficient evidence and given that a suspicion that a person committed a crime is well grounded. ... I would like to remind you that on 24 May the Prosecutor General's Office detained Tymoshenko, respectively, it detained her without sufficient reason because the case against her was opened on fanciful charges. It is precisely this that we would like the European Court of Human Rights to rule on.</blockquote>Vlasenko also asked the the ECHR look at rules 39, 40 and 41 of the <A href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/6AC1A02E-9A3C-4E06-94EF-E0BD377731DA/0/RulesOfCourt_April2011.pdf">Rules of the European Court</a> [text, PDF], which involve procedural errors he believes the Ukrainian <a href="http://www.gp.gov.ua/">Prosecutor General's Office</a> (PGO) [official website, in Ukrainian] has made. Last month, EU official <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ashton/index_en.htm">Catherine Asthon</a> [official profile] <A href = "http://en.rian.ru/world/20110526/164245015.html">expressed concern</a> [RIA Novosti report] that the latest charges against Tymoshenko were politically motivated.

<p>In May, the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/ukraine-ex-prime-minister-charged-with-abuse-of-office.php">PGO charged Tymoshenko</a> [JURIST report] under <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16257/preview">Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine</a> [text] with <a href="http://www.gp.gov.ua/ua/news.html?_m=publications&_c=view&_t=rec&id=93242">abuse of office</a> [press release, in Ukrainian] in connection with signing gas import contracts with Russia. In Feburary, the PGO <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ukraine-prosecutors-combine-charges-against-former-pm-tymoshenko.php">combined two separate criminal cases</a> [JURIST report] against her and concluded the pre-trial investigation. The combined cases against Tymoshenko include charges initiated in December for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ukraine-prosecutors-charge-ex-pm-tymoshenko-with-misusing-state-funds.php">allegedly misappropriating state funds</a> during her time as prime minister from 2007-2010 and new charges in January alleging that she <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ukraine-prosecutors-launch-new-investigation-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">abused her authority and exceeded her official duties</a> [JURIST reports] while in office by purchasing "1000 Opel Combo" medical vans at a 20 percent mark-up. Tymoshenko said the vans were successful in providing medical services to rural villages. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Australian <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/www/ministers/mcclelland.nsf/Page/Home">Attorney General Robert McClelland</a> and <a href="http://www.ministerhomeaffairs.gov.au/">Minister for Home Affairs and Justice Brendan O'Connor</a> [official websites] announced that the Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill of 2011 aims to provide Australian agencies with better access to international Internet information collections, facilitate cybercrime investigations and align current cybercrime offenses with those punishable by an international cybercrime treaty. If the laws are approved by parliament, the country will be poised to make its accession to the Council of Europe (COE) <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/html/185.htm">Convention on Cybercrime</a> [text], the international treaty on cybercrime. McClelland emphasized the importance of the legislation as it relates to the international treaty, as well as maintaining a safe domestic environment for Internet use:<blockquote>While Australian law substantially complies with the obligations in the Convention, the Government believes there is more we can do to ensure Australia is in the best position to tackle cyber threats that confront us, both domestically and internationally. The increasing cyber threat means that no nation alone can effectively overcome this problem and international cooperation is essential. Australia must have appropriate arrangements domestically and internationally to be in the best possible position to fight cybercrime and cyber security threats.</blockquote>More than 40 nations have signed or become a party to the Convention. 

<p>Several countries have attempted to bolster cymbercrime security enforcement in recent years. In early June, US authorities announced that they are <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-investigating-google-allegations-of-china-hacking.php">investigating claims by Google</a> [JURIST report] that hundreds of personal Gmail accounts were breached by hackers in China. In November 2009, the Iranian government <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/iran-sets-up-committee-to-fight.php">announced the establishment of a new police unit</a> [JURIST report] to fight Internet crime, though opposition leaders said its true purpose was to crack down on protesters and voices of dissent, who rely on the Internet to get their message out. The Finnish legislature passed the <a href="http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2003/en20030460.pdf">Exercise of Freedom of Expression in Mass Media Act</a> [unofficial translation, PDF] in December 2008 that now <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-finds-finland-violated.php">provides a remedy to victims of Internet crime</a> [JURIST report], but it was not in effect at the time of an incident of Internet pedophilia. The <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/us-senate-ratifies-coe-cybercrime.php">US Senate ratified</a> [JURIST report] the COE Convention on Cybercrime, which is intended to improve information- and evidence-sharing  between national governments to prevent crimes on the Internet, in August 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The immigration reform <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess119_2011-2012/bills/20.htm">bill</a> [SB 20 text] allows police officers to check a suspect's immigration status during a lawful stop, seizure, detention, or arrest, and mandates businesses to participate in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system, which confirms a person's employment eligibility.

Immigrant advocacy groups, like the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/what-we-do/immigrant-justice">Southern Poverty Law Center Immigrant Justice Project</a> [advocacy website] argue that the South Carolina laws and other similar laws invite racial profiling and infringe on human rights:<blockquote>It is extremely disappointing to see the South Carolina state legislature following in these ill-fated footsteps by passing this legislation that will sacrifice citizens&#8217; safety, cost the state an untold amount in taxpayer dollars and perpetuate bigotry. If Gov. Haley signs this legislation, SPLC will join our counterparts in fighting this unconstitutional and racist law to protect the civil rights of every South Carolinian.</blockquote>The legislation will now proceed to South Carolina <a href="http://www.nikkihaley.com/">Governor Nikki Haley</a> [official website] for signing.

<p>Several other state legislatures have acted recently to implement so-called "Arizona style" immigration laws. The <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/house/house.html">North Carolina House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/north-carolina-passes-bill-requiring-use-of-everify.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] in June to pass a <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2011/Bills/House/PDF/H36v7.pdf">bill</a> [HB 36 text, PDF; <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2011&amp;BillID=H36">materials</a>] requiring all employers with 25 or more employees to check the immigration status of their hires using the E-Verify system.

Last month, <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] asked the ICC to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/cote-divoire-president-asks-icc-to-launch-probe-into-crimes-after-disputed-november-election.php">launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections last November. Violence has been ongoing since last year's disputed election, with factions of Ouattara and ousted former president <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] still engaging in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-reports-violence-continues-in-ivory-coast.php">retaliatory killings</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The Ivory Coast <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">announced it would establish a commission</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month, to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections last November. Thsi investigation may take <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE75L02M20110622">up to two years</a> [Reuters Africa]. An official for the International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of Gbagbo earlier this month.

According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March.

The law, passed by the Dutch Parliament's lower house, the <a href="http://www.tweedekamer.nl/">Tweede Kamer</a> [official website, in Dutch], will prevent operators including <a href="http://www.kpn.com/corporate/aboutkpn/Company-profile.htm">KPN</a>, <a href="http://www.vodafone.com/content/index.html">Vodafone</a> and <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> [corporate websites] from imposing extra fees for free services like Skype. The Netherlands is the <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/article?a=807182&single=1&f=24">second country to enact a network neutrality law</a> [NYT report]. Consumer advocates praised the legislation, comparing network neutrality to freedom of speech and press, and indicating that the law sets a positive precedent for other nations. Opponents of the law argue that the restrictions will deter investment and innovation, and possibly lead to higher prices for basic Internet service. Patrick Nickolson, a spokesman for KPN, expressed concern that the Dutch Parliament, which adopted the law after just two months of deliberation, did not spend more time discussing the implications of the new law.

<p>Chile became the first country to implement network neutrality laws when the Chilean Parliament passed the laws in July 2010. In April, the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-house-votes-against-net-neutrality-regulations.php">voted to overturn regulations</a> [JURIST report] aimed at preserving the Internet as a free and open platform of communication after the <a href="http://fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/fcc-approves-net-neutrality-rules.php">approved the regulations last year</a> [JURIST report], which prevent Internet providers from selectively blocking web access. Just days before, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-fcc-net-neutrality-rules.php">granted a motion by the FCC to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a challenge to the new net neutrality rules. The court dismissed the appeal for improper timing because the challenged rulemaking document has yet to be published in the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/">Federal Register</a> [official website]. The challenges were filed by <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/verizon-files-lawsuit-challenging-fcc-net-neutrality-regulations.php">Verizon</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/cell-phone-company-sues-fcc-over-net-neutrality-rules.php">MetroPCS</a> [JURIST reports] in January out of concern over the broad authority the regulations would grant to the FCC. A previous court ruling found that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-fcc.php">FCC lacks the power to enforce net neutrality</a> [JURIST report]. Net neutrality is thought by supporters to be essential to the goal of an open flow of information over the Internet regardless of the amount of revenue generated by the information.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The organization filed an appeal after a judge for the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-new-jersey-health-care-suit.php">dismissed the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in December, ruling that the health care reform law does not cause the alleged harms and does not violate the Constitution. Wednesday's <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=13905462">arguments</a> [AP report] focused primarily on whether or not the plaintiffs had standing to sue since the law is not being implemented until 2014 and, therefore, the plaintiffs have not yet suffered economic harm.

<p>Similar cases regarding the constitutionality of PPACA are being heard in federal courts across the nation. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eleventh-circuit-hears-arguments-on-constitutionality-of-new-health-care-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of the individual mandate. The appeal was brought by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Deparment of Justice</a> (DOJ) after the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] struck down the entire health care law after it determined that the individual mandate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">exceeds Congress' authority</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause. Also this month, the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/sixth-circuit-hears-challenge-to-health-care-law-individual-mandate.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a similar challenge to the constitutionality of the individual mandate brought by the <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?682648548">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website]. The appeal stems from a ruling <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/federal-judge-upholds-health-care-law.php">upholding</a> [JURIST report] PPACA and the contested requirement. Also this month, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decided it can rule on two challenges to PPACA after the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/fourth-circuit-questions-authority-to-hear-health-care-law-challenge.php">requested briefs</a> [JURIST report] from all parties on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> (AIA) [text], which prevents injunctions against taxes before the tax is imposed, would bar review of PPACA until it is implemented. The Fourth Circuit already <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in May to resolve a split decision between the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against the individual mandate</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdeathpenalty.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="http://apublicdefender.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/evans-mcneil.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that Florida's procedure for imposing the death penalty is unconstitutional. Florida's <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/FileStores/Web/Statutes/FS08/CH0921/Section_0921.141.HTM">death penalty statute</a> [Fla Stat Ann &#167; 921.141 text] provides that the jury in a capital case is to make an "advisory sentence" to the court based on whether certain aggravating factors exist that would warrant a sentence of either life imprisonment or death. These aggravating factors include whether the offense was for pecuniary gain, especially heinous or cruel, or whether the homicide was cold, calculated, and premeditated.  The court either accepts or rejects this recommendation and then makes findings of its own regarding the existence of sufficient aggravating circumstances. In a 94-page decision, Judge Jose Martinez found that the method by which a death sentence is imposed in Florida violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial because the jury should be making these findings, not the judge, due to the risk that the judge will base his decision on factors that were not even considered by the jury. To support his decision, Martinez cited <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=ring+v.+arizona&hl=en&as_sdt=2,7&case=13989927396342823081&scilh=0">Ring v. Arizona</a> [opinion text], a 2002 Supreme Court case ruling that a similar scheme in Arizona was unconstitutional. The <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/index.cfm">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> (ACLUFL) <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/index.cfm?action=viewRelease&emailAlertID=3933">applauded the decision</a> [press release]:<blockquote>This is yet another sign of the systematic injustices that make up Florida's death penalty system&#8212;which is already plagued by wrongful convictions, racial inequities, the highest rate of exonerations and inadequate legal representation. ... It is past time to end state-sponsored executions and replace the unfair, unjust, and unconstitutional death penalty system with mandatory life in prison.</blockquote>
The case at issue is a 1991 murder-for-hire case involving Paul Evans, who was convicted of killing a woman's spouse in exchange for a camcorder, stereo and insurance money.  After trial proceedings had concluded, the jury recommended 9-3 that Evans be sentenced to death and the court accepted the recommendation.

<p>The death penalty remains a controversial issue worldwide. In March, Illinois <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Pat Quinn</a> [official website] signed <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/fulltext.asp?DocName=09600SB3539ham001&GA=96&LegID=51489&SessionId=76&SpecSess=0&DocTypeId=SB&DocNum=3539&GAID=10&Session=">Senate Bill 3539</a> [text] into law, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">abolished the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] in the state. The law is set to take effect on July 1. According to an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2010/en/17348b70-3fc7-40b2-a258-af92778c73e5/act500012010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">report</a>], the number of countries using the death penalty dropped in 2009, but more than 700 people were executed in 18 countries, with the most executions carried out in Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the US. Last August, the <a href="http://www.gasd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia</a> [official website] heard a <em>habeas</em> petition from Troy Davis, who was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering an off-duty Savannah, Georgia police officer. In a rare move, the federal court heard the habeas petition after Davis had exhausted his state remedies under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=104_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ132.104">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> [text], but the court sided against Davis saying that he failed to prove his innocence. <a href="http://www.schr.org/">Law Offices of the Southern Center for Human Rights</a> [official website] Executive Director Sarah Totonchi <a href="/hotline/2010/09/uncertainty-in-davis-highlights-problems-with-death-penalty.php">argues</a> [JURIST commentary] said that "Troy Davis' case illustrates that US courts simply cannot provide the certainty necessary to impose an irreversible punishment; therefore the death penalty must be abolished."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lieutenant General Ziya Guler and officer Bulent Akalin were <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/06/22/Turkish-general-arrested-in-coup-probe/UPI-94501308765140/">arrested after appearing in court</a> [UPI report] to testify about documents related to the coup that were discovered last year. The <a href="http://www.taraf.com.tr/">Taraf</a> [media website] newspaper revealed last year that the plot included plans to bomb Istanbul mosques and provoke Greece into shooting down a Turkish plane in order to undermine the government. 

<p>The alleged coup plot highlights the continuing power struggle between Turkey's ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish] and the country's secular nationalist establishment, the <a href="http://www.tsk.tr/INDEX.html">Turkish Armed Forces</a> (TAF) [official website, in Turkish]. Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-police-detain-more-than-40-in.php">detained more than 40 people</a> in connection with the plot in February 2010 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">continued to bring charges</a> against alleged perpetrators, but <a href="/paperchase/2010_02_25_indexarch.php">released three high ranking military officials</a> [JURIST reports] just days later. The "Sledgehammer" plot is similar to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] conspiracy, in which the secular group is suspected of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">planning to overthrow</a> [JURIST report] the AKP. The Ergenekon group is also alleged to be involved in bombings, political assassination plots and the death of journalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6279907.stm">Hrant Dink</a> [BBC obituary]. The probe into the Ergenekon conspiracy has been criticized as an attempt by the AKP to silence opposition and further its <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1001934.html">imposition of Islamic principles</a> [DPA report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">report</a>] in violation of Turkey's secular <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/tu00000_.htmll">constitution</a> [text]. <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">Trials against the Ergenekon group</a> [JURIST report] opened over two years ago with more than 200 suspects in custody.

Wilders has made several "anti-Islam" comments as a political official, including: several comments similar to "I don't hate Muslims, I hate Islam"; comparing the <em>Koran</em> to <em>Mein Campf</em> and calling for it to be banned; proposing a tax on wearing a hijab, or burqa; proposing a halt to Muslim immigration to the Netherlands; and creating the film <a href = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1198399/"><em>Fitna</em></a> [IMDB backgrounder], where terrorist attack images are juxtaposed with quotations from the <em>Koran</em>. The court's judgment stated that in the larger context of the immigration debate, statements against Islam were permissible, especially since his statements were not made against individuals or even groups of people, but the religion itself.<blockquote>[S]uspect, as a politician, made the remarks that through his eyes, there are evil aspects of Islam and the <em>Koran</em>. When the alleged statements ... are viewed, both the wording and in conjunction with other statements, most of these statements that can only be seen as on Islam and the <em>Koran</em>. The suspect in these statements directed them against the faith and not against people (Muslims) and it can not be proven legally and convincingly that he incites hatred with these statements and/or discrimination against Muslims, as he was charged with. Regarding several statements, the court considers that these statements also include criticism of individuals, especially politicians, who in the opinion of the accused, do not recognize evil aspects of Islam. These (parts of) the statements can not therefore also be brought under incitement to hatred or discrimination against people because of their religion.</blockquote>

<p>The original parties are planning to <a href = "http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/06/23/wilders-vrijgesproken-van-groepsbelediging/">sue the Netherlands in an international court</a> [NRC report] in reaction to the verdict. Reactions from Dutch figures has been <a href = "http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2011/06/23/reacties-op-vrijspraak-geert-wilders-overwegend-positief/">mixed</a> [NRC report], with equal amounts praising the decision as a victory for free speech and decrying the legitimization of hate speech. The Wilders case was analyzed by <a href=http://www.kaveity.nl/professionals/Gerolf_Hagens.htm>Gerolf Hagens</a> [Teamleider, <a href=http://www.kaveity.nl/>Kaveity and Kaveity</a>] in <a href = "/hotline/2011/04/the-trial-against-geert-wilders.php">Geert Wilders trial explores new frontiers of Dutch politics, society and jurisprudence</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>

<p>In May, the court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/netherlands-court-rules-hate-speech-case-can-continue.php">rejected claims by Wilders</a> [JURIST report] that the hate speech <a href="http://www.om.nl/actueel-0/strafzaken/strafzaak_tegen/">charges</a> [prosecution materials, in Dutch] against him should be dropped over claims of bias. Wilders claimed that one of the judges had <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gMCzMdfhehjAmFHA8rsnMO_780vw?docId=CNG.88fd56d674abda860b0428dc480c8b1d.3a1">tried to convince</a> [AFP report] the defense's expert witness to support the claims at a 2010 dinner party. While the court allowed prosecution to continue for any statements Wilders made likening Islam to Nazism, it dropped a complaint against him for referring to the <em>Koran</em> itself as "fascist," holding that prosecutors were precluded from including statements comparing Islam to fascism alone. In March, an Amsterdam court rejected Wilders' claims of improper venue, ruling that the Amsterdam court has the authority to judge the case, given that the alleged statements were committed within its jurisdiction. In February, the court granted Wilders the right to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12456693">set out the objections</a> [BBC report] he had made during the initial trial, which was postponed following the <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-dismisses-judges-for-bias-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">dismissal of the original panel of judges</a> [JURIST report] amidst allegations of bias. Prior to their dismissal, the original panel members heard the prosecution's case, which culminated in a request that Wilders be <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-prosecutor-requests-politicians-acquittal-for-anti-islamic-statements.php">acquitted on all charges</a> [JURIST report]. The prosecutors based their request on determinations that the politician's statements were directed at Islam and not Muslims themselves and additionally, that the evidence failed to establish that he intended to incite violence. The presentment of the prosecution's case followed an order from a panel of Dutch judges to resume the trial after initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-court-rejects-bias-allegations-in-politicians-trial-for-anti-islam-statements.php">rejecting claims of judicial bias</a> [JURIST report]. The trial had previously been <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/dutch-politicians-trial-suspended-soon-after-it-begins.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] after a lawyer representing Wilders accused one of the judges of making a statement which cast him in an unfavorable light to the jury.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice David Taliano of Ontario's <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Superior Court of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ontario-court-finds-canada-medical-marijuana-laws-unconstitutional.php">invalidated</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-227/index.html">Marihuana Medical Access Regulations</a> (MMAR) [text] in April, finding that the program's mechanisms for licensing patients to access <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medical+marijuana">medical marijuana</a> [JURIST news archive] are insufficient. These inadequate licensing procedures led Taliano to strike down portions of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38.8/">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> [text] that criminalize marijuana growth and possession. The Crown <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Feds+appeal+Ontario+marijuana+ruling/4650951/story.html">appealed</a> [<em>Montreal Gazette</em> report] the Superior Court decision and the appeals court is currently waiting to hear that appeal. Taliano had ordered that Ottawa fix the medical marijuana program within 90 days or face the possible legalization of medical marijuana. The suspension of the lower court ruling effectively prevents these results from going into effect until the appeal court rules on the matter, which will likely <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/22/medical-marijuana-law-gets-reprieve">take place in the fall</a> [<em>Toronto Sun</em> report].

<p>US Courts have also been forced to interpret medical marijuana statutes in recent years. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-rejects.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state's <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials]. Earlier that month, New Jersey became the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">fourteenth US state</a> [JURIST report] to legalize medical marijuana. In November, voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an expansion of the state's existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine the fifth state to allow dispensaries, following California, Colorado, Rhode Island and New Mexico. California's Fourth District Court of Appeal ruled in 2008 that the MMP is <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/california-court-rules-medical.php">not in conflict with the Supremacy Clause</a> [JURIST report] and does not violate the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa.html">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA) [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2011/HB0329.html">legislation</a> [HB 0329 text] requiring healthcare providers to notify parents or a judge 48 hours before performing an <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] on a minor. <a href="http://www.governor.nh.gov/">Governor John Lynch</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.governor.nh.gov/media/news/2011/061511-hb329.htm">vetoed the bill last week</a> [press release], but it was <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/northeast/view/20110622nh_abortion_notification_bill_to_become_law/">passed</a> [AP report] by a vote of 266-102 in the <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/">House of Representatives</a> and 17-7 in the <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/senate/">Senate</a> [official websites]. While the bill includes an exception in the case of a "medical emergency," Lynch said he was "troubled by the lack of an exception for the victims of rape, incest and abuse." 

<p>The bill, to take effect January 1, passes just days after an Illinois appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/illinois-appeals-court-orders-lower-court-to-rule-on-abortion-notification-law.php">ordered a lower court</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether a similar law requiring a girl's guardians to be notified before she has an abortion should be enforced. The New Hampshire bill is the latest in a variety of abortion-related legislation this year. Last month, Planned Parenthood and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota law requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">first get a sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Head of the special court Sediqullah Haqiq <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110623/wl_nm/us_afghanistan_election_court">announced the ruling</a> [Reuters report] that 62 out of the 249 legislators in the <a href="http://wj.parliament.af/english.aspx">Wolesi Jirga</a> [official website] elected last year have to vacate their seats and be replaced, sending the government into turmoil just as the US announced a major troop withdrawal. Afghan <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/index_eng.aspx">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamid+karzai">news archive</a>] set up the special court by decree, which critics claim was to invalidate election gains made by his political opponents. Karzai's ethnic group and the base of the Taliban was underrepresented in the elections. Furthermore, the constitutional authority for the special court is in question, and it is unclear whether there can be any appeal. Haqiq announced the ruling as "final" but ousted legislators are submitting letters to the country's Supreme Court. Enforcement of the ruling is also unclear as it orders the <a href="http://www.iec.org.af/eng/">Independent Election Commission</a> (IEC) [official website] to disqualify the legislators whose elections it deems invalid, but the IEC <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h4ibnZbAs9Zx2_igQ05EeycBcrSg?docId=CNG.24c01f7b9ff53959e522b5434198c816.3d1">does not recognize the legitimacy</a> [AFP report] of the special court. Last September's election was marred by widespread allegations of fraud, as was the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=afghanistan+election">2009 presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] in which Karzai came to power.

<p>With the US withdrawing troops, ongoing disputes over irregularities in last September's parliamentary elections have raised doubts about the stability of the Afghan government. Last January, Karzai <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-president-orders-delay-in-seating-of-new-parliament.php">postponed the seating</a> [JURIST report] of Parliament following a request by the special court for more time to look into allegations of fraud surrounding the elections. Karzai had <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/afghanistan-high-court-to-investigate-election-complaints-possibly-changing-results.php">promised</a> [JURIST report] to have the special court review the election results in time to seat the election by the original January deadline. But the IEC claims that the special does not have legal authority to question the results that it certifies because the law says it has the final say in determining the elections results. In November, the Afghanistan <a href="http://www.ecc.org.af/en/">Electoral Complaints Commission</a> (ECC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/afghanistan-officials-disqualify-21-parliamentary-candidates-for-fraud.php">disqualified 21 candidates</a> [JURST report] for electoral fraud after finding widespread voting irregularities in 12 provinces. Of the disqualified candidates, 19 had either won or were leading in their districts, seven of which were incumbents, and two were second place finishers in districts where the first place finisher was also disqualified. In October, the IEC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/afghanistan-officials-invalidate-13-million-votes-following-fraud-investigation.php">invalidated 1.3 million votes</a> [JURIST report], nearly a quarter of the 5.6 million votes cast nationwide, due to findings of fraud. The IEC found that the 2,543 polling stations where the votes had been cast did not follow IEC procedures. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation of Human Rights</a> [advocacy website], the Tunisian League of Human Rights and the National Council for Freedoms in Tunisia <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/2/8/14889/World/Region/Rights-groups-find-fault-with-Ben-Ali-conviction.aspx">expressed approval</a> [AFP report] of the 35-year jail sentences and $65.6 million fine <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-35-years-in-absentia.php">handed down earlier this week</a> [JURIST report] but also criticized the trial proceedings for not including Ben Ali and his wife, who are currently in exile in Saudi Arabia, for not including victims involved in the case, and for the unusually brief deliberations. The groups ultimately advocated reforms for "greater respect of the rights of the defense." "The opening of the trial of the former dictator," the groups stated, "conforms with the aspirations of the Tunisian people to justice, but the importance of this trial demanded that all conditions for a right to a fair trial should have been met first." The sentences will take effect despite the couple's exile and even though Saudi Arabia has ignored demands for extradition.

<p>Ben Ali and his wife were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/trial-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-begins-in-absentia.php">also charged</a> [JURIST report] with illegal possession of drugs and weapons, but the verdict for those charges will not be announced until June 30. Ben Ali fled Tunisia to Saudi Arabia in January during protests against his 23-year autocratic rule in which his <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE75J0MI20110620?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true">family amassed substantial wealth</a> [Reuters report] that many Tunisians say was at their expense. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges against him</a> [JURIST report] which stem mostly from allegations that he authorized the use of force against protesters during the Tunisian revolution, resulting in more than 200 deaths. The uprisings in Tunisia and ousting of Ben Ali were the beginning of similar uprisings across the Middle East also resulting in the ousting of former Egypt president <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Hosni+Mubarak%27">news archive</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Marshall</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-state-secrets-privilege-personal-jurisdiction-and-preclusion.php">JURIST report</a>], agreeing that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction in this instance. The opinion, delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts, explained that the bankruptcy court judge has a limited role beyond bankruptcy's core proceedings, even as defined in <A href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/157.html">28 USC &#167; 157(b)(2)(C)</a> [text], and found the core proceeding listed in this case unconstitutional. Although one of the core proceedings is counterclaims, and the court found there was a statutory basis for the decision, they found that portion of the statute unconstitutional under <A href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [text]. Since bankruptcy judges do not enjoy the tenure or salary stated under Article III, the Court ruled they cannot go beyond bankruptcy proceedings.<blockquote>We recognize that there may be instances in which the distinction between public and private rights&#8212;at least as framed by some of our recent cases&#8212;fails to provide concrete guidance as to whether, for example, a particular agency can adjudicate legal issues under a substantive regulatory scheme. Given the extent to which this case is so markedly distinct from the agency cases discussing the public rights exception in the context of such a regime, however, we do not in this opinion express any view on how the doctrine might apply in that different context. What is plain here is that this case involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power: the entry of a final, binding judgment by a court with broad substantive jurisdiction, on a common law cause of action, when the action
neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime. If such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the Article III Judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous "public right," then Article III would be transformed from the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers we have long recognized into mere wishful thinking.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in the opinion, stating that he believes "an Article III judge is required in all federal adjudications, unless there is a firmly established historical practice to the contrary," rather than the "public right" analysis Roberts utilized. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, stating he believed the statute was constitutional.

<p>The case involved deceased model Anna Nicole Smith's (Vickie Lynn Marshall) bankruptcy proceedings. The beneficiary of her late husband's estate, Pierce Marshall, attempted to collect as a creditor in her bankruptcy, claiming defamation. She filed a counterclaim for tortious interference in the gift her late husband, J. Howard Marshall, had attempted to bequeath her, to try and recover the $88 million that had been denied to her in prior estate proceedings. The US Court of the Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/19/02-56002.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the bankruptcy court exceeded its jurisdiction in ruling on the case. The case had returned to the Ninth Circuit after the Supreme Court's 2006 ruling in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/marvmar.html"><span class="Marshall v. Marshall">Marshall v. Marshall</span></a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/supreme-court-hears-dispute-over.php">report</a>] that federal courts can in some cases decide disputes which involve state probate laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

New Mexico</a> that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag6_user.html">Confrontation Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] does not allow laboratory reports containing testimonial certification to be entered into evidence against a defendant without the testimony of the analyst who personally observed the test and certified the report. Donald Bullcoming was arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). A forensic laboratory report of a machine-generated blood test showed his blood alcohol content (BAC) was above the legal limit. The court reversed the <a href="http://nmsupremecourt.nmcourts.gov/">Supreme Court of New Mexico</a> [official website] which allowed the laboratory report, despite holding that it was "testimonial," because another analyst familiar with the testing device and procedures used, but had neither participated in nor observed the testing, was called to validate the report. The state never asserted that the analyst who conducted the tests was unavailable, but the record showed he was placed on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. The majority opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that the laboratory report depended on live in-court testimony as to its veracity. The other analyst did not satisfy this requirement because he did not take part in the actual testing. The court also noted that this prevented the defense from cross-examining the testing analyst as to why he was placed on unpaid leave. The court also rejected the state's argument that the laboratory report was not testimonial because it was was merely the results of a machine-generated test. Ginsburg's opinion held the laboratory report was testimonial under the Court's holding in <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/forensic-lab-reports-are-testimonial.php">Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts</a> [JURIST report] because of the certification formalities attending the report. However, Justice Anthony Kennedy argued in the dissenting opinion that the majority makes the "misstep" of extending the holding from <spanclass="casename">Melendez-Diaz</span>, in which there was no one present to testify at trial, to this situation where "a knowledgeable representative of the laboratory was present to testify and to explain the lab's processes and the details of the report." He said: <blockquote>The procedures followed here, but now invalidated by the Court, make live testimony rather than the solemnity of a document the primary reason to credit the laboratory's scientific results. Unlike Melendez-Diaz, where the jury was asked to credit a laboratory's findings based solely on documents that were quite plainly affidavits, here the signature, heading, or legend on the document were routine authentication elements for a report that would be assessed and explained by in-court testimony subject to full cross-examination. The only sworn statement at issue was that of the witness who was pre-sent and who testified.</blockquote> Justice Sonia Sotomayor, with whom Justice Elena Kagan joined, filed a concurring opinion disagreeing with Ginsburg's holding that lab report was testimonial because of its formalities and because applying the Confrontation Clause to forensic evidence is not an undue burden on the State. Sotomayor argued instead that laboratory reports are testimonial when in addition to formality, they are created with the purpose of use at trial against the defendant. 

<p>During <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-10876.pdf">oral arguments</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST report] last March, the justices repeatedly questioned counsel for New Mexico regarding their assertion that there is a difference between an affidavit offered by an analyst, as in <spanclass="casename">Melendez-Diaz</span>, and a purely machine-produced report. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, focusing on the certification of both documents, pressed counsel as to how they could be considered distinguishable, saying, "I'm sorry, could you tell me what that means? Why is it different than the affidavit? It's certified, and my understanding of the dictionary meaning of certification is that that's an attestation as to the truth of the statements contained therein. That's the common definition." Justice Antonin Scalia, focusing on the fact that the analyst had been placed on leave without pay during the trial, stated perhaps the most important reason why the defendant should have been permitted to cross examine the analyst, "Does the defense know why it was leave without pay? Could the defense have found out in cross-examination that the reason he was leave without pay because he was&#8212;had shown himself to be incompetent, and they were in the process of firing him? I don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be important to the defense?"</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the opinion of the court, except for Part III-B-2, which only Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Antonin Scalia join. The court found impossibility in meeting both the state's higher standard and the FDA's standard of identical labels between brand name and generic drugs and denied plaintiffs' claim under their respective states' tort laws. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent decrying the broadening of the impossibility standard.<blockquote>We have traditionally held defendants claiming impossibility to a demanding standard: Until today, the mere possibility of impossibility had not been enough to establish pre-emption. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) permits&#8212;and, the Court assumes, requires&#8212;generic-drug manufacturers to propose a label change to the FDA when they believe that their labels are inadequate. If it agrees that the labels are inadequate, the FDA can initiate a change to the brand-name label, triggering a corresponding change to the generic labels. Once that occurs, a generic manufacturer is in full compliance with both federal law and a state-law duty to warn. Although generic manufacturers may be able to show impossibility in some cases, petitioners, generic manufacturers of metoclopramide (Manufacturers), have shown only that they might have been unable to comply with both federal law and their state-law duties to warn respondents Gladys Mensing and Julie Demahy. This, I would hold, is insufficient to sustain their burden.</blockquote>She went on that the opinion is dangerous and holds a multitude of consequences for current tort law surrounding drugs. Justice Thomas responded in a footnote that the situation is too rare to impact the drug industry significantly.

<p><span class="casename">PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing</span> was a consolidated case with <span class="casename">Actavis Elizabeth, LLC v. Mensing</span> and <span class="casename">Actavis v. Demahy</span>. In all the cases, petitioners were prescribed a brand name drug and instead received the generic version. The drugs, created to treat digestive tract disorder, sometimes caused a severe nervous system disorder with continued use. At the time, in 2001, this did not appear on the brand name label, and thus, due to FDA regulations that require generic drugs to match the brand name, did not appear on the generic label. The manufacturers claims this prevented them from creating more accurate warnings. Petitioners took the generic drug manufacturers to court, citing a higher standard in their state laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

IMS Health</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-freedom-of-speech.php">report</a>], finding <a href = "http://www.leg.state.vt.us/statutes/fullsection.cfm?Title=18&Chapter=091&Section=04631">Vermont's Prescription Confidentiality Law</a> [text] a violation of freedom of speech under the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The law attempted to stifle the common practice of drug manufacturers gathering prescription records from pharmacies and using them to target advertisements to doctors. The pharmacies release the information freely and publicly, although any identifying information for patients is redacted. The Vermont law made it illegal for pharmacies to do this without the patient's consent. Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion ruled that this was both a content and speaker based restriction on free speech and does not pass a "heightened" scrutiny standard, primarily because the statute allows records to be used for educational and state purposes, but not marketing.<blockquote>The capacity of technology to find and publish personal
information, including records required by the government, presents serious and unresolved issues with respect to personal privacy and the dignity it seeks to secure. In considering how to protect those interests, however, the State cannot engage in content-based discrimination to advance its own side of a debate. If Vermont's statute provided that prescriber-identifying information could not be sold or disclosed except in narrow circumstances then the State might have a stronger position. Here, however, the State gives possessors of the information broad discretion and wide latitude in disclosing the information, while at the same time restricting the information's use by some speakers and for some purposes, even while the State itself can use the information to counter the speech it seeks to suppress. Privacy is a concept too integral to the person and a right too essential to freedom to allow its manipulation to support just those ideas the government prefers.</blockquote> The Court also rejected arguments that "heightened" scrutiny is inappropriate due to the law being characterized by Vermont as "mere commercial regulation."

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, writing that "this effect on expression is inextricably related to a lawful governmental effort to regulate a commercial enterprise." He rejected the Court's use of "heightened" scrutiny, including a long history of intermediate scrutiny applied when the government directly restricts commercial speech. Breyer cautioned the Court not to return to the era of <span class="casename">Lochner v. New York</span>, when the Court judged every individual regulation or State law that could interfere with a business' "liberty." He also characterized the harm in the case as "modest at most."</p>]]></content:encoded>

McBride</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-rules-against-government-in-freedom-of-information-case.php">report</a>] that a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode45/usc_sec_45_00000051----000-.html">Federal Employers' Liability Act</a> (FELA) [text] railroad negligence claim does not require proof of proximate cause. Respondent Robert McBride worked as a railroad engineer for petitioner <a href="http://www.csx.com/">CSX Transportation</a> [corporate website]. McBride initiated a FELA claim, alleging that CSX negligently required him to use unsafe switching equipment and failed to train him to operate that equipment, both of which, he claims, led to a debilitating hand injury he sustained while on the job.  At trial, the jury was not instructed on "proximate cause" because FELA renders railroads liable for employees' injuries or deaths "resulting in whole or in part from [carrier] negligence." CSX appealed after the jury found in favor of McBride. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court decision, declining to <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/11-23-CSX-Opinion-Below.pdf">hold</a> [opinion, PDF] that common-law proximate causation is required to establish liability under FELA. The Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court decision. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority, noted that its decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/352/500/case.html">Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co.</a> [text] could not have been read to implement a "proximate cause" standard of causation in FELA lawsuits. Rather, the <span class="casename">Rogers</span> court announced the "any part" test, which asks whether "negligence of the employer played any part at all" in bringing about the injury:<blockquote>[T]he understanding of Rogers we here affirm "has been accepted as settled law for several decades." ... Countless judges have instructed countless juries in language drawn from Rogers. To discard or restrict the Rogers instruction now would ill serve the goals of "stability" and "predictability" that the doctrine of statutory <em>stare decisis</em> aims to ensure.</blockquote>The court also looked at the statutory history of FELA and other precedential cases interpreting FELA's language to reach its conclusion.

<p>Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito, argued in his dissent that the majority creates a limitless standard of causation for FELA claims and that the standard adopted by the majority is akin to a "but-for" test. Roberts pointed out that the Supreme Court has previously explained that in FELA cases, "[a]bsent express language to the contrary, the elements of a FELA claim are determined by reference to the common law." Because recovery for common law negligence has always required a showing of proximate cause, the same standard should apply to FELA claims. Furthermore, the dissent contends that the majority misinterpreted the <em>Rogers</em> decision, which, according to Roberts, was limited to cases of contributory negligence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-sentence-reduction-patent-infringement-cases.php">report</a>] that an individual whose sentence is imposed under a plea agreement may be eligible for a reduced sentence if the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/">US Sentencing Commission</a> (USSC) [official website] subsequently alters the sentencing guidelines. The <a href="http://law.onecle.com/uscode/18/3553.html">Sentencing Reform Act of 1984</a> (SRA) [text] allows the USSC to create and amend <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/Guidelines/2010_guidelines/index.cfm">Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials], and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00003582----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 3582(c)(2)</a> [text] permits a defendant to move for a sentence reduction if the USSC reduces the sentencing guideline after the defendant was sentenced. The Supreme Court, in a plurality, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, held that this section of the SRA also permits an individual who agreed to a plea bargain to move for a sentence reduction if the sentencing court "based" the sentencing on the guideline recommendations. Petitioner William Freeman was indicted for several crimes, including possession with intent to deliver cocaine base, and agreed to serve eight years and eight months in prison in exchange for his guilty plea. The district court accepted that agreement, and, pursuant to <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/CR2009.pdf">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C)</a> (FRCP) [text, PDF], the sentence followed federal sentencing guidelines and was binding on the court. Three years into Freeman's sentence, the USSC retroactively reduced the sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine possession in order to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that defendants who enter into 11(c)(1)(C) agreements cannot benefit from retroactive guideline amendments. In reversing the appeals court's decision, the Supreme Court looked at the SRA, FRCP and sentencing guideline policy statements to conclude that defendants can move to reduce sentences imposed pursuant to a plea bargain. The plurality reasoned that because courts typically accept plea agreements based on an evaluation of the guideline's recommended sentence, the SRA applies to 11(c)(1)(C) agreements. In Freeman's case, the court did in fact rely on the sentencing guidelines, and Freeman is permitted to move for a reduction of his sentence. 

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her concurring opinion, argued that courts do not necessarily factor in sentencing guidelines when determining whether to implement a plea agreement. However, when a court "expressly" or "evidently" relies on the sentencing guidelines, as in Freeman's case, defendants should be permitted to move for a reduced sentence. Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas, dissented, agreeing with Stomayor's controlling opinion and suggestion that courts do not accept plea agreements "based on" sentencing guidelines, but disagreed with Sotomayor and the plurality's conclusion that Freeman could petition for a reduced sentence, concluding that "parties entering a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement must take the bitter with the sweet."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo said that <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/F9AF01D6-28E5-4533-9398-3F4B616BB7DB.htm">thousands have been killed</a> [ICC press release] and hundreds detained and raped in the months-long struggle between ousted leader <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] and rival <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] after Gbagbo refused to give up power. If Moreno-Ocampo is allowed to investigate, this would be his seventh inquiry into African conflicts and the first investigation into a state not party to the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/index.html">Rome Statute</a> [official website], which gives the ICC jurisdiction upon referral by the <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=sc">Security Council</a> [official profile]. The Ivory Coast, however, after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/cote-divoire-president-asks-icc-to-launch-probe-into-crimes-after-disputed-november-election.php">lettered appeal</a> [JURIST report] by Ouattara to the ICC to open an investigation, has given the ICC jurisdiction. Moreno-Ocampo will send a security assessment team to the Ivory Coast on Monday and has not yet determined who is at fault for the violence.

<p>The Ivory Coast announced  earlier this month <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">it would establish its own commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections. This investigation may take <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE75L02M20110622">up to two years</a> [Reuters report]. Also, an official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of Gbagbo earlier this month. In April, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">urged Ouattara to conduct an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged atrocities carried out by his forces in its attempts to secure the presidency. According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Pre-Trial chamber will deliver is decision on the application for warrants against Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam, and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi in a public hearing Monday in The Hague. Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official websites] said <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-16/world/libya.gadhafi_1_saif-al-islam-arrest-warrants-moammar-gadhafi?_s=PM:WORLD">his office has gathered "direct evidence"</a> [CNN report] that the men committed crimes against humanity in connection with efforts to quell the three-month old Libyan revolt. Moreno-Ocampo said the evidence shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protestors and that his forces used live ammunition on crowds, attacked civilians in their homes, used heavy weapons against people in funeral processions and placed snipers to shoot those leaving mosques after prayer services. Libya has said it does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC and will ignore the warrants if issued. Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] last month that his office was pursuing arrest warrants against Gaddafi and the two others in his "inner circle." He said Saif al-Islam was acting as Gaddafi's "defacto Prime Minister" and called al-Sanussi Gaddafi's "right-hand man" and "executioner." At that time, Moreno-Ocampo said his office was almost prepared for trial, having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya. 

<p>There have been numerous allegations of war crimes and human rights violations over the Libyan revolt which has persisted since February. Last week, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports] earlier this month on its findings. The report said Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack." Also this month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] expressed concern over the arrests of dozens of civilians by Libyan opposition authorities. HRW called on the National Transitional Council (NTC), the opposition ruling body in Libya with de facto control over eastern Libya, to provide civilian detainees with full due process rights, access to counsel and the ability to challenge their detention before independent judicial authorities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Geele had already been sentenced to <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/denmark-court-sentences-muhammad-cartoonist-attacker-to-9-years.php">nine years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for the attack. In Denmark, crimes involving an additional infliction of terror typically attach a 12-year sentence, but the court lowered Geele's sentence to 10 years because he had attacked one individual rather than a group of civilians. Geele was <a href="http://www.cphpost.dk/component/content/50908.html?task=view">convicted</a> [<em>Copenhagen Post</em> report] on charges of attempted murder and terrorism for <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/denmark-prosecutors-add-terrorism.php">breaking into</a> [JURIST report] Westergaard's home and threatening him with an axe and knife. 

<p>Westergaard's 2005 picture of the Muhammad was one of a series of caricatures published by a Danish newspaper that infuriated Muslims around the world. Many Muslims consider depictions of Muhammad offensive, and when other newspapers reprinted the caricatures in 2006 it triggered violence in several countries, leading to multiple <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/muhammad-cartoons-furor-kills-15-in.php">deaths</a>, the <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/muslim-cartoon-protestors-burn-danish.php">burning of Danish embassy buildings</a> [JURIST reports] and boycotts of Danish goods.

Cherbeya, a member of the activist group Voice of the Voiceless, was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10223564">found dead in his own car</a> [BBC report] in June 2010. Eight men, all DRC policemen, were accused of being involved in the murder and were subsequently arrested. The trial for five of the men <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/drc-court-begins-trial-over-death-of-rights-activist-chebeya.php">began in November</a> [JURIST report], while three remained at large. The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13895771">court sentenced</a> [BBC report] one of the eight to life in prison, acquitted three, and sentenced the three at-large individuals to death. The Chief of Police Intelligence at the time of the murder, Colonel Daniel Mukalay, was the highest ranking of the suspects and was sentenced to death for planning the assassination. 

<p>The assassination of a prominent rights activist by law enforcement is merely the latest in the ongoing human rights issues facing the DRC. In February, a military court found Lt Col Kibibi Mutware <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/drc-colonel-sentenced-to-20-years-imprisonment-for-mass-rapes.php">guilty of involvement in mass rapes</a> [JURIST report] that took place on New Year's Day and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment, dismissing him from the military. In early October, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">called for the DRC government</a> [JURIST report] to arrest general Bosco Ntaganda pursuant to an outstanding warrant for war crimes issued by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. Earlier that same week French authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/france-authorities-arrest-drc-war-crimes-suspect-under-icc-warrant.php">arrested a leader</a> [JURIST report] of the Democratic Force for the Liberation of Rwanda for crimes committed by that group in the DRC. In October, UN peacekeeping forces and the DRC government <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-forces-arrest-rebel-leader-for-drc-mass-rapes.php">arrested Mai Mai Cheka</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly leading a rebel group responsible for mass rapes in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Renzi is under indictment for allegedly using his political office to profit from a real estate deal in 2005. He argued that negotiations regarding the deal, entered as evidence to a grand jury, were privileged "legislative acts" under the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei">Speech or Debate Clause of Article I</a> [text] of the US Constitution and therefore the evidence must be excluded and the case dismissed. The Ninth Circuit did not agree:
<blockquote>We recognize, as we must, that the Speech or Debate Clause is a privilege that "has enabled reckless men to slander and even destroy others with impunity." But the Supreme Court has made equally clear that the Speech or Debate Clause does not "make Members of Congress supercitizens, immune from criminal responsibility." Because we cling to "the precise words" of the Court's own Speech or Debate jurisprudence and "the sense of those cases, fairly read," we conclude that Renzi's actions fall beyond the Clause's protections. We therefore deny Renzi the relief he seeks.</blockquote>The decision also added a racketeering charge that had previously been removed. Renzi's trial date has not yet been scheduled.

<p>In June 2010, the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] <a href="http://azdailysun.com/news/local/state-and-regional/article_6af5aeb8-7460-11df-b00c-001cc4c03286.html">threw out recorded conversations</a> [<em>Arizona Daily Sun</em> report] of Renzi and one of his attorneys, ruling that the recordings were a violation of <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii">Article III</a> [text] and the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. The court, though, ruled that the indictment would remain. When <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/arizona-congressman-indicted-for-fraud.php">Renzi was indicted in 2008</a> [JURIST report], prosecutors alleged he used his position on the <a href="http://resourcescommittee.house.gov/">House Natural Resources Committee</a> [official website] to block federal land transfer deals unless land owned by Texas real estate investor James W Sandlin was included. In exchange, Renzi allegedly received over $700,000 in payoffs. Sandlin was also indicted on charges of extortion, fraud, money-laundering and conspiracy and has since pleaded guilty.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court sentenced the <a href="http://byshr.org/wp-content/List-of-Defendants-BYSHR.pdf">protestors</a> [profiles, PDF] to lengthy prison sentences, including life terms. Ban urged Bahraini authorities to comply with international human rights obligations such as ensuring the right to due process and a fair trial and permitting the defendants to appeal their sentences. A spokesperson for the secretary-general <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=5372">relayed Ban's sentiments</a> [text] about how Bahraini authorities should proceed:<blockquote>The Secretary-General hopes that the Bahraini authorities will do everything possible to create an environment conducive for the start of a concrete national dialogue announced by His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa Al Khalifa, and believes that it should be genuine, inclusive and lead to tangible outcomes which address the legitimate aspirations of all Bahrainis.</blockquote>The sentences were imposed as a result of Bahrain's crackdown on the recent wave of demonstrations calling for democracy in the country.

<p>Bahrain's Lower National Safety Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-military-court-sentences-eight-activists-to-life-in-prison.php">sentenced the 21 activists</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday for anti-government protests conducted earlier this year. The convicted were <a href="http://byshr.org/wp-content/Charges-and-Articles.pdf">charged</a> [charges, PDF] with "plotting to topple the leadership of the Kingdom of Bahrain," but rights organizations have denied this, stating that all convicted were protesters exercising freedom of speech. The National Safety Courts, special military tribunals, were instituted in mid-March under <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&amp;id=38">King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa's</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">three-month state of emergency</a> [JURIST report] and have been internationally criticized, most <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">recently</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-sentences-shiite-cleric-8-others-for-police-kidnapping.php">sentenced nine citizens</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in prison for kidnapping a police officer in May. In April, the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">sentenced four protestors to death</a>, a rarity in Bahrain, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bahrain-court-upholds-2-death-sentencess-for-police-killings--dnp.php">upheld the sentences</a> [JURIST reports] for two of the men, who were accused of murdering police officers.

Representatives <A href = "http://www.house.gov/frank/welcome.html">Barney Frank</a> (D-MA) and <a href = "http://paul.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1">Ron Paul</a> (R-TX) [official websites] wrote the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011 to amend the <a href = "http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/21C13.txt">Controlled Substances Act</a> [text], removing marijuana, hemp and cannabis from the schedule. Currently, marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug, which the government believes has a high potential for abuse, no medical merit and is unsafe to use with medical supervision. If the bill passes, like alcohol and tobacco, states would be able to regulate the substance or prohibit it completely. In a <a href = "http://reason.com/blog/2011/06/23/more-on-the-frankpaul-marijuan">conference call</a> [<em>The Reason</em> blog], Frank expressed that the bill's passage is unlikely, but felt its introduction represented progress. He also noted that the public is receptive to marijuana legalization while the government is not. Recently, the US government has released several statements renewing their commitment to the "War on Drugs" in reaction to the <a href = "http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org">Global Commission on Drug Policy</a> [official website] releasing a <A href = "http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/Download.ashx?File=Global_Commission_Report_English.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] recommending <a href = "paperchase/2011/06/international-commission-recommends-legalizing-marijuana.php">international legalization of cannabis, marijuana and other drugs</a> [JURIST report]. The US <a href = "http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov">Office of National Drug Policy</a> (ONDCP) [official website] released a statement in response, <a href = "http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/news/press11/060211.html">denouncing the report</a> [text]: "Legalization remains a non-starter in the Obama Administration because research shows that illegal drug use is associated with voluntary treatment admissions, fatal drugged driving accidents, mental illness, and emergency room admissions."

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/Senate.asp">Connecticut Senate</a> [official website] approved <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/AMD/S/2011SB-01014-R00SA-AMD.htm">SB 1014</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&bill_num=1014&which_year=2011&SUBMIT1.x=6&SUBMIT1.y=9">materials</a>] which provides for the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/connecticut-senate-approves-marijuana-decriminalization-bill.php">decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, Arizona <a href = "http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> (R) [official website] filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-file-lawsuit-over-controversial-state-medical-marijuana-law.php">federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] seeking a declaratory judgment over the legality under federal law of the state's <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/arizona-voters-approve-medical-marijuana-law.php">legalization of medical marijuana</a> [JURIST report] passed in November 2010. Medical marijuana is currently legal in 14 US states. In October 2009, US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] issued <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">guidelines for a new policy</a> [JURIST report] for investigating and prosecuting state-sanctioned medical marijuana use. Those guidelines reflect a pledge made by Holder in March to <a href = "/paperchase/2009/03/doj-to-end-raids-on-medical-marijuana.php">stop federal raids</a> [JURIST report] on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state laws. However, Holder has emphasized that if a state legalizes drugs for recreational use, <a href = "http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/16/local/la-me-marijuana-holder-20101016">federal law will be enforced</a> [<em>LAT</em> report], as California <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/western-voter-reject-propositions-to-expand-access-to-legalized-marijuana.php">attempted to legalize marijuana last year</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/urbina">Ricardo Urbina</a> [official profile] denied a petition for writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> initiated by Khairullah Khairkhwa, a Taliban government media spokesman, governor and Cabinet minister. While the government contends that Khairkhwa provided material support to the Taliban, the detainee maintains he was merely a civilian administrator and did not participate in military operations. Urbina held that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Khairkhwa participated in clandestine meetings to discuss Iranian weapon and military support related to operations against the US, and had specialized knowledge about locations of personnel and military operations. Urbina also indicated that Khairkhwa's involvement with the Taliban was prolonged:<blockquote>Despite the petitioner's efforts to portray himself as a reluctant, marginal figure within the Taliban, the record indicates that the petitioner rose to the highest level of the Taliban and had close ties to Mullah Omar, who repeatedly appointed the petitioner to sensitive, high-profile positions. Indeed, even after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, the petitioner remained within Mullah Omar's inner circle, despite the fact that Mullah Omar had limited his contacts to only his most trusted commanders.</blockquote>Afghanistan's Peace Council, a commission set up by Afghan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3135938.stm">President Hamid Karzai</a> [BBC profile, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hamid+karzai">news archive</a>], <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8306978/Afghan-peace-council-risks-angering-US-by-demanding-release-of-Taliban-leader-Khairullah-Khairkhwa-from-Guantanamo.html">asked that Khairkhwa be returned to Kabul</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] in February to facilitate peace talks between the government and Taliban leaders. Khairkhwa has been at Guantanamo for more than nine years.

<p>There have been over 200 writs of <em>habeas corpus</em> filed on behalf of  Guantanamo Bay detainees. In June, a judge for the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/87F8BA8DC6EA1F67852578AB004EC213/$file/10-5291-1312587.pdf">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-overturns-release-of-yemeni-guantanamo-detainee.php">report</a>] the release of Yemeni Guantanamo Bay detainee <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/1015-hussein-salem-mohammed">Hussein Salem Mohammed Almerfedi</a> [NYT profile], an alleged <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] supporter. A <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-denies-habeas-for-guantanamo-detainee.php">federal appeals court denied <em>habeas corpus</em></a> [JURIST report] to Guantanamo Bay detainee Musa'ab Omar al-Madhwani in May, concluding that he was lawfully detained for being part of al Qaeda. In March, an appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-appeals-court-overturns-release-order-for-yemeni-guantanamo-detainee.php">blocked the release</a> [JURIST report] of Guantanamo detainee Uthman Abdul Rahim Mohammed Uthman by <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/727BF5F867C51399852578620051FD30/$file/10-5235-1300403.pdf">overturning</a> [opinion, PDF] a district court decision that claimed the government had failed to prove prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Uthman had received and executed orders from al Qaeda. In September, Kuwaiti Guantanamo detainee Fawzi Khalid Abdullah Fahad al Odah <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Al-Odah-cert-petition-9-28-10.pdf">petitioned</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/guantanamo-detainee-appeals-to-supreme-court-for-habeas-relief.php">report</a>] the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to reverse a federal appeals court decision that denied him <em>habeas corpus</em> relief.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsame-sex.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A Maryland court ruled Thursday that the spousal privilege preventing spouses from being compelled to testify against one another applies to a lesbian couple married in Washington DC, recognizing the rights of  <a href="<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22same-sex+marriage%22">same-sex married</a> [JURIST news archive] couples though Maryland does not allow the practice. Judge Donald Beachley of the <a href="http://www.courts.state.md.us/clerks/washington/index.html">Maryland Washington County Circuit Court</a> [official website] ruled that the <a href="http://www.herald-mail.com/news/hm-judge-rules-that-samesex-spouse-can-invoke-spousal-privilege-20110623,0,6149400.story">spouse of a same-sex married couple was privileged</a> [<em>Herald-Mail</em> report] from testifying against her spouse in a criminal domestic violence case. Maryland does not allow same-sex marriages, but the couple was married in Washington DC, where such marriages are legal, in August 2010. Deborah Snowden was charged with assault and reckless endangerment for allegedly threatening Sha'rron Snowden with a knife. When called to the stand, Sha'rron refused to testify against Deborah invoking the spousal privilege. Beachley then suspended the proceedings to hear arguments on whether the privilege could be invoked. Beachley ruled under the "principle of comity" between states, following Maryland's law which usually recognizes valid marriages from other states even if those marriages would not be valid if performed in Maryland. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="http://www.aclu-md.org/aPress/Press2011/Snowden.pdf">joint brief</a> [text, PDF] arguing that Sha'rron should not be compelled to testify by virtue of the spousal privilege. Susan Sommer, Director of Constitutional Litigation at Lambda Legal, <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/md_20110623_aclu-and-lambda-legal-laud.html">lauded</a> [press release] the decision: "Long-standing Maryland law recognizes a valid marriage even if it had not been entered in Maryland. The court's ruling treats this couple like any other married Maryland couple and should guide the way for other Maryland courts."

<p>Earlier this month,  the <a href="http://www.cacb.uscourts.gov/">US Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/california-bankruptcy-court-rejects-federal-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=DOMA">news archive</a>], a federal law barring same-sex marriage, is unconstitutional. The same-sex couple had tried to file for Chapter 13 joint bankruptcy for married couples. The court applied a "heightened scrutiny" standard but found it did not even meet rational basis review. Same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial issue among states. Also this month, a federal judge in California <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-refuses-to-vacate-california-same-sex-marriage-ruling.php">refused to vacate</a> [JURIST report] an earlier ruling finding that <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], California's ban on same-sex marriage, was unconstitutional. In April, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/delaware-house-passes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">Delaware</a> House of Representatives voted in favor of same-sex civil unions while the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] Senate approved an amendment to its state constitution banning same-sex marriage. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tymoshenko <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/oe4a4z3w">criticized the judiciary herself</a> [press release] several times: "This is a real gang of criminals. Some people wear prosecutor's uniforms, while others sit in black gowns. I appeal to you, slaves in gowns&#8212;remember that you are a court." The defense also filed motions to <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_24_6_sud2">permit access to the press</a>, to have a <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/z6nem3uz">jury trial</a>, to <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/3uosxou8">dismiss the case</a>, to <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/5239nc6x">remove</a> Judge Rodion Kirieyev and <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_24_6_sud11">for an extra month to review the case materials</a> [press releases]. The motion for press access was <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/8ss96x3o">granted</a>, but Kirieyev <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_24_6_sud10">refused to recuse</a> [press releases] himself twice. The motion for more time was denied. The motion for a jury trial was not ruled on. Tymoshenko's website also reported that the EU is <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/5cz4azse">watching the case closely</a> [press release]. No one in the EU has released an official statement commenting on the trial, but last month, EU official <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ashton/index_en.htm">Catherine Asthon</a> [official profile] <A href = "http://en.rian.ru/world/20110526/164245015.html">expressed concern</a> [RIA Novosti report] that the latest charges against Tymoshenko were politically motivated. The court was <a href = "http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/yulia_tymoshenko_24_6_sud1">recessed until Saturday</a> [press release].

<p>Earlier this week, Tymoshenko <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ukraine-ex-pm-tymoshenko-files-complaint-with-europe-rights-court.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], alleging violations of the <A href = "http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The complaint argues that the charges against Tymoshenko are politically engineered by current Ukrainian <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/">President Viktor Yanukovych</a> [official website, in Ukrainian], Tymoshenko's political rival. In May, the <a href="http://www.gp.gov.ua/">Prosecutor General's Office</a> (PGO) [official website, in Ukrainian] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/ukraine-ex-prime-minister-charged-with-abuse-of-office.php">charged Tymoshenko</a> [JURIST report] under <a href="http://legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/16257/preview">Article 365 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine</a> [text] with <a href="http://www.gp.gov.ua/ua/news.html?_m=publications&_c=view&_t=rec&id=93242">abuse of office</a> [press release, in Ukrainian] in connection with signing gas import contracts with Russia. In Feburary, the PGO <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ukraine-prosecutors-combine-charges-against-former-pm-tymoshenko.php">combined two separate criminal cases</a> [JURIST report] against her and concluded the pre-trial investigation. The combined cases against Tymoshenko include charges initiated in December for <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ukraine-prosecutors-charge-ex-pm-tymoshenko-with-misusing-state-funds.php">allegedly misappropriating state funds</a> during her time as prime minister from 2007-2010 and new charges in January alleging that she <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ukraine-prosecutors-launch-new-investigation-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">abused her authority and exceeded her official duties</a> [JURIST reports] while in office by purchasing "1000 Opel Combo" medical vans at a 20 percent mark-up. Tymoshenko said the vans were successful in providing medical services to rural villages. The current combined case against her is not the first time she has been prosecuted. Last May, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/ukraine-prosecutors-reopen-criminal-probe-of-ex-pm-tymoshenko.php">reopened a separate criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that Tymoshenko attempted to bribe Supreme Court judges. Tymoshenko's government was dissolved in March 2010 after she narrowly lost the presidential election to Yanukovych. Tymoshenko had alleged that widespread voter fraud allowed Yanukovych to win the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The six were charged with conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity including extermination, murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The court also charged Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, former Minister of Women's Development and first female genocide criminal, and her son Arsene Shalom Ntahobali with rape. The court determined that the systematic killing of thousands of ethnic Tutsi authorized and facilitated by the individuals during the genocide amounted to crimes against humanity. Nyiramasuhuko was sentenced to life in prison based on the finding that she was guilty of seven of the 11 charges against her. The varying sentences for the other individuals range from 25 years in prison to life sentences. The six, who were arrested 16 years ago, will receive credit for time served.

<p>The ICTR has tried a number of genocide suspects since its 1994 inception. The court <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case%5CEnglish%5CHategekimana%5Cjudgement%5C101206-summary.pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment summary, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ictr-convicts-former-military-officer-of-genocide.php">report</a>] former Rwandan Armed Forces lieutenant <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=3&amp;mnid=2">Ildephonse Hategekimana</a> [case materials] in December to life imprisonment after convicting him on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. In November, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ictr-convicts-former-rwanda-businessman-on-genocide-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former Rwandan businessman Gaspard Kanyarukiga on charges of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity and sentenced the 65-year-old to 30 years in prison. The ICTR's work has recently been hampered by a lack of resources, leading the tribunal to <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/un-war-crimes-tribunals-ask-general-assembly-for-more-resources.php">ask the UN for assistance</a> [JURIST report] in October. The tribunal has faced adversity since its creation, including the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ictr-defense-lawyer-shot-dead.php">shooting death</a> [JURIST report] of one of the senior defense lawyers in July. Earlier this year, Joseph Nzirorea, former president of the Rwanda National Assembly and secretary general of the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rwanda-ex-official-dies-while-facing-genocide-trial-at-ictr.php">died while on trial</a> [JURIST report] for conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide, genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and serious violations of Common Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions/">Geneva Conventions</a> [text].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The case was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">transferred to military commission</a> despite Obama's and US Attorney General Eric Holder's plan to try 9/11 suspects in civilian courts, after Congress <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">imposed a series of restrictions</a> [JURIST reports] barring the transfer of detainees to the US. 

<p>In March, a judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] allowed a lawsuit against the <a href="http://www.loc.gov">Library of Congress</a> (LOC) [official website] to continue on behalf of former Guantanamo prosecutor and former LOC employee <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/Jan2006/d20060111Davis.pdf">Col.

He argues that his termination by the LOC violated his constitutional rights, alleging it was due to his outspoken criticism of the military commissions, writing articles, giving speeches and testifying before Congress that the system is fundamentally flawed, specifically a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704402404574525581723576284.html">high-profile piece</a> [text] for the <a href="http://online.wsj.com">Wall Street Journal</a> [official website].

If the bill passes it would replace the current "first inventor to use" system with a "first inventor to file" system, making US patents more like the European and Japanese systems. In turn, it also changes the way other inventors can challenge a patent, including revising the appeals system. A similar <a href = "http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-23">bill</a> [bill materials] passed the Senate in January. The America Invents Act now goes to reconciliation where differences will be negotiated over between the House and Senate, and then to President Barack Obama, who is <A href = "http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/24/technology/patent_reform_bill/">expected to sign the bill</a> [CNN report].

<p>There have been several significant legal decisions in patent law in the last few months. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] unanimously <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-290.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] against <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> [corporate website], holding that a patent will be invalidated only if the challenging party meets the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules-against-microsoft-in-patent-infringement-case.php">"clear and convincing evidence" standard</a> [JURIST report]. The court also held in a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/us-supreme-court-rules-in-case-over-stanfords-rights-to-hiv-testing-invention.php">separate decision</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/35/usc_sup_01_35_10_II_20_18.html">Bayh-Doyle Act</a> [35 USC &#167;&#167; 200-212], which vests patent rights to universities for inventions from federally funded research, did not give <a href="http://stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> [academic website] superior rights to the invention of its employee and thus, the employee could transfer his invention rights to a third party. In May, the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-6.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that induced patent infringement <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-in-patent-infringement-case.php">requires knowledge</a> [JURIST report] that the induced acts constitute patent infringement. Also in May, the <a href = "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1511.pdf">restricted</a> [opinion, PDF] the use of the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-restricts-inequitable-conduct-defense-for-patent-law.php">"inequitable conduct" defense</a> [JURIST report] for invalidating patents. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission will compile recommendations for Yemeni officials and the international community and publish the report at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in September.

<p>Rights groups have criticized Yemen for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have persisted since February. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] in April urging the international community to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate protestor deaths.

General Hector Mario Lopez Fuentes, former chief of staff of Guatemalan armed forces from 1982-1983, is accused of directing military attacks against citizens, namely indigenous Mayans. Villages were destroyed and women and girls were systematically raped under his authorization. Fuentes was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13819853">arrested last week</a> [BBC report] and charged for his involvement in Guatemala's <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/guatemala.htm">36-year civil war</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. Margot Wallstrom, the Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, applauded the arrest:<blockquote>The apprehension of General Lopez Fuentes sends a strong signal to all perpetrators that conflict-related sexual violence is not acceptable, and that justice will ultimately prevail. Sexual violence thrives on silence and impunity. Women have no rights if those who violate their rights go unpunished.</blockquote>The UN also indicated that "the arrest sends a strong signal that justice can prevail in the Central American country."

<p>The Guatemalan civil war resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala's large indigenous population. According to a UN report released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. In response to these violations, the Guatemalan government founded the National Compensation Program (PNR) in 2003 to deal with claims by civilians affected by the civil war. The PNR, after setting up its administrative structure, has begun to use its $40 million budget to work through a backlog of more than 98,000 civilian complaints. More than 1,000 complaints were filed in 2008. The PNR hopes to file the majority of the complaints within the next year. The <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.gt/">Congress of Guatemala</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/guatemala-congress-establishes-body-to.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to create the <a href="http://cicig.org/index.php?page=home-page">International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala</a> (CICIG) [official website] in April 2007, <a href="http://www.congreso.gob.gt/gt/ver_noticia.asp?id=4115">establishing an independent body</a> [press release, in Spanish] to investigate organized crime and official corruption, including the country's civil war. In February 2008, the Guatemalan government announced <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/guatemala-panel-to-declassify-documents.php">plans to declassify documents</a> [JURIST report] describing human rights abuses committed by its military during the civil war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

First, the House overwhelmingly <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll493.xml">voted down 123-295</a> [roll call vote] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.J.RES.68:">resolution</a> [HJ RES 68] that would have authorized further operations in Libya. Then hours later, it <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll494.xml">voted down 180-238</a> [roll call vote] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.2278:">measure</a> [HR 2278] that would have defunded the operations, save for rescue and intelligence efforts to assist NATO. Even if the House had passed the measure, it had <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-congress-libya-20110624,0,1213107.story">little chance of passing</a> [LAT report] the Democratically controlled <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website], as Majority Leader <a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Harry Reid</a> (D-NV) [official website] has already expressed support for the operations in Libya. Speaker of the House <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a> (R-OH) [official website] had threatened to defund the mission after sending <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] a letter earlier this month warning him that he was within five days of violating the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_33.html">1973 War Powers Resolution</a> [50 USC &#167; 1541 <em>et seq.</em>].

<p>Obama disagrees with certain members of Congress regarding his legal authority to continue military operations in Libya. Obama's position is that he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-releases-report-justifying-actions-and-cost-in-libya.php">not in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the War Powers Resolution. His office maintains that US activities in Libya do not amount to "hostilities" because the US is only playing a supporting role in the NATO-led mission pursuant to and limited by the UN Security Council Resolution authorizing military action in Libya to protect civilians. But earlier this week, it was reported that Obama came to this conclusion <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-lawyers-divided-over-legality-of-us-operations-in-libya.php">overriding the legal interpretations</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel</a> [official websites]. <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> [academic profile] of the University of Houston Law Center <a href="/forum/2011/05/jordan-paust-libya-war-powers.php">has argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that Obama is not violating the War Powers Resolution because that was only meant to limit his authority as Commander-In-Chief but in this case Obama is acting pursuant to his Executive authority under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II</a> [text]. He argues: "given the fact that treaties of the United States (such as the UN Charter) are supreme federal laws, it is evident that the President has constitutionally-based authority to faithfully execute US competencies under the Charter outside of the President's independent authority as Commander-in-Chief."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision <a href="http://www.delhrv.ec.europa.eu/?lang=en&content=3441">calls for negotiations to close</a> [press release] by the end of the month and the accession treaty to be signed by year's end, allowing for the country to become the 28th member of the EU on July 1, 2013. In the interim, EU leaders strongly encouraged Croatia to continue pursuing crucial reform initiatives. Announcing the development, Council president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8358504.stm">Herman Van Rompuy</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.delhrv.ec.europa.eu/files/file/articles-Copy%20of%20HVR%20on%20political%20agreement%20on%20accession%20of%20Croatia-1308925634.pdf">remarked</a> [press release]:<blockquote>[Croatia] has turned the fundamentals of the State inside out to be fully aligned with European standards. It performed impressively through the past months&#8212;even up until the last weeks and days. Moreover, we are confident that you will continue to pursue the necessary reforms with the same vigor until the accession date, and beyond. Croatia's achievement serves as an inspiring example for the other countries of the Western Balkans. Croatia demonstrates that with political will, a strong national consensus and dedicated work, it is possible to overcome the shadows of the past and to move towards membership of the European Union.</blockquote>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] formally <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-to-join-european-union-in-2013.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] Croatia for accession earlier this month. Countries still in formal negotiations for acceptance into the EU include <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/iceland/index_en.htm">Iceland</a>, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/the_former_yugoslav_republic_of_macedonia/index_en.htm">Macedonia</a>, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/montenegro/index_en.htm">Montenegro</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/index_en.htm">Turkey</a> [EC materials]. It was also announced earlier this month that <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidates/serbia/index_en.htm">Serbia</a> [EC materials] will become a <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2011&mm=06&dd=10&nav_id=74853&version=print">candidate country next year</a> [B92 report], with talks slated to open in the spring.

<p>Croatia has been increasing efforts to reform their judiciary in order to gain accession to the EU. Earlier this month, Croatian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/croatia-indicts-former-interior-minister-for-war-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] former military commander and senior interior minister <a href="http://www.biografije.org/mercep.htm">Tomislav Mercep</a> [official profile, in Croatian] for war crimes committed against Serbians during the 1990s conflict in the Balkans. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR64/003/2010/en/81544213-9880-4a5e-acea-d5269d0bc8ad/eur640032010en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] calling for the prosecution of individuals responsible for war crimes a day prior to Mercep's arrest. In 2008, AI called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes. In March 2005, the EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/eu-to-delay-entry-talks-for-croatia.php">suspended entry talks</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that Croatia was failing to fully cooperate with the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] investigating war crimes in the area. The entry talks resumed in October of that year after the ICTY declared that Croatia was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/icty-says-croatia-now-cooperating-on.php">fully cooperating</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.nysenate.gov/">New York State Senate</a> [official website] had passed the Marriage Equality Act 33-29 earlier that day following weeks of negotiations. The act eliminates any legal distinctions between opposite-sex and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=marriage">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive] and specifies that no clergy member will be forced to perform a marriage ceremony and that any refusing clergy member will not be subject to legal action. The New York State Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-assembly-again-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill,-stalls-in-senate.php">passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the month 80-63. The law will go into effect on July 25, 2011. In a <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/062411passageofmarriageequality">press release</a> [text], Cuomo praised the passage of the bill:<blockquote>New York has finally torn down the barrier that has prevented same-sex couples from exercising the freedom to marry and from receiving the fundamental protections that so many couples and families take for granted. With the world watching, the Legislature, by a bipartisan vote, has said that all New Yorkers are equal under the law. With this vote, marriage equality will become a reality in our state, delivering long overdue fairness and legal security to thousands of New Yorkers.</blockquote>

<p>The New York State Assembly had passed same-sex marriage bills before in <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/new-york-assembly-passes-spitzer-gay.php">2007</a> and in <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/new-york-state-assembly-approves-same.php">2009</a>, but the bills were <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/new-york-senate-rejects-same-sex.php">unable to pass the Senate</a> [JURIST reports]. Before the passage of the Marriage Equality Act, New York recognized such marriages performed in other states. Earlier this year, the New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/new-york-appeals-court-allows-surviving-same-sex-spouse-to-inherit-estate.php">upheld</a> a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-surviving.php">lower court decision</a> [JURIST reports] allowing the surviving spouse of a same-sex marriage legally performed in Canada to inherit the deceased spouse's estate. With the legislation, New York becomes the seventh US jurisdiction to allow same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is also legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

EU High Representative <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/ashton/about/cv/index_en.htm">Catherine Ashton</a> [official profile] commended the move, noting the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/EN/foraff/123114.pdf">positive effects that ratification will have</a> [press release, PDF] on prosecuting war crimes. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] offered <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/tunisia-joins-international-criminal-court-2011-06-24">similar praise</a> [press release] and encouraged the country's regional neighbors in North Africa to follow suit. Ambassador Christian Wenaweser, Permanent Representative of Liechtenstein and President of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Statement/PASP-TUN-24062011-ENG.pdf">remarked</a> [press release]:<blockquote>Ratifying this founding document of the International Criminal Court has become a symbol of a country's commitment to the rule of law and the fight against impunity. I am very pleased to see that Tunisia has decided to send this strong message as an expression of a future on the basis of the rule of law. This is especially true for the most serious crimes under international law: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. Tunisia's accession to the Rome Statute is also a testament of the profound changes brought about by the "Arab Spring," which started in Tunisia. It fulfills a central demand of peoples everywhere for societies guided by clear rules and the principle of equality before the law.</blockquote>Tunisia becomes the 116th signatory to the treaty since 1998.

<p>The ICC has been one vehicle through which the international community has attempted to hold accountable leaders in the Middle East and North Africa who have used violent means to quell protests during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tunisia+OR+libya">Arab Spring</a> [JURIST news archive]. In February, the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-security-council-unanimously-imposes-sanctions-on-libya.php">referred the situation in Libya to the ICC</a> [JURIST report], following allegations of violence against protesters by the government of Muammar Gaddafi. Earlier this week, the ICC said it will decide whether to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">issue arrest warrants for Gaddafi</a> [JURIST report] and two high-ranking officials on allegations of war crimes. Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] said his office has gathered "direct evidence" that the men committed crimes against humanity in connection with efforts to quell the three-month old Libyan revolt. Libya has said it does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC and will ignore the warrants if issued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging the two provisions, one which authorized state and local police officers to make warrantless arrests of persons who have an immigration court removal order against them or who they have probable cause to believe have been indicted or convicted of aggravated felonies. The second challenged provision created a new infraction for anybody other than police officers to knowingly or intentionally accept consular identification as a valid form of identification. Judge Sarah Baker rejected the police officers authority to arrest based on the concession by the defendants that nothing under Indiana law makes the receipt of a removal order, a notice of action or a person's having been indicted for or convicted of an aggravated felony a crime. Baker also expressed concern that the statute contains no reference to <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag1_user.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] protections nor does it include a requirement that power to arrest be granted only if the officer has a separate lawful reason for the arrest. Baker also faulted the statute for failing to provide due process: <blockquote>Apart from the exclusion of Fourth Amendment requirements regarding probable cause to arrest, Section 19 bestows no authority on law enforcement officers beyond the power to arrest for the noncriminal conduct enumerated therein, leaving a deafening silence as to what happens to the arrestee post his arrest. There is no mention of any requirement that the arrested person be brought forthwith before a judge for consideration of detention or release. There is in fact a complete void within the new statute regarding all other due process protections.</blockquote>The order rejected the state's authority to make warrantless arrests based on preemption, finding that the states have no authority to assist the federal government in enforcing immigration laws on their own accord without any agreement with the federal government.   

<p>Similar immigration laws have been enacted across the country. In April, the Georgia General Assembly approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/georgia-legislature-passes-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">requiring police to check the immigration status</a> [JURIST report] of anyone they have probable cause to believe has committed a criminal offense and requiring businesses to use E-Verify to check the immigration status of potential employees. Similar legislation has also been approved in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">Utah</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports]. Arizona's law is also currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">enjoined</a>, and Arizona Governor Jan Brewer (R) has <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-ask-supreme-court-to-lift-injunction-on-controversial-immigration-law.php">pledged to appeal to the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports]. In May, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">upheld an Arizona law</a> [JURIST report] requiring employers to utilize the E-Verify system, finding that it was not preempted by federal law and thus not a violation of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art6_user.html#art6_hd7">Supremacy Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. This decision could have an impact on lawsuits challenging legislation in other states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The panel, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/hamdan-appeal-to-be-reviewed-en-banc-by-us-court-of-military-commission-review.php">decided to hear the appeal</a> [JURIST report] in September, ultimately <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-25/news/29703603_1_conviction-military-commission-review-war-crimes">rejected</a> [AP report] the defense's argument that Hamdan's charge of providing material support to terrorism is not a war crime capable of being prosecuted by a military tribunal, stating: <blockquote>It is not appellant's conduct in isolation that constitutes a law of war violation triable by military commission. Rather, it is his knowledge, intent, and conduct, in support of terrorism, and in the specific context of a conflict triggering application of U.S. treaty obligations per Common Article 3, which make it cognizable under the 2006 M.C.A. In enacting the 2006 M.C.A., Congress circumscribed the capacity of the military to unilaterally interpret the law of war and craft law of war offenses and punishments in connection with al Qaeda and terrorism offenses. The charges at bar are not the exercise of fiat or expediency by the executive branch; they are the product of closely prescribed statutes of limited application encompassing the peculiarities of the modern geopolitical environment.</blockquote> Hamdan was originally <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-found-guilty-by-guantanamo.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in August 2008 on <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/May2007/Hamdan_Charges.pdf">charges</a> [charge sheet, PDF], which stemmed from his employment as Bin Laden's driver, and sentenced to 66 months of imprisonment, but given credit for 60 months he had already spent in US custody.

<p>In November 2008, Hamdan was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-to-transfer-hamdan-to-yemen-before.php">released</a> [JURIST report] to his native country Yemen to serve the last month of his prison sentence and is now living freely in Yemen. His release alleviated concerns that arose when government lawyers said he could be <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-seeking-extended-sentence-for.php">held indefinitely</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2008, a US military judge <a href="http://media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2008/10/30/16/hamdan-sentence-ruling.source.prod_affiliate.56.pdf">denied</a> [ruling, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-military-judge-denies-prosecution.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/us-motion-re-hamdan-sentence-9-24-08.pdf">request</a> [motion, PDF] by prosecutors that he reconsider a decision that reduced Hamdan's <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/hamdan-sentence-could-mean-fewer-than.php">sentence</a> [JURIST report] from five-and-a-half years to six months because of credit for time already served. Hamdan was initially taken into custody in 2001, and in 2006 he successfully challenged President George W. Bush's military commission system when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that the commission system as initially construed violated US and international law.

The first, <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1127/BillText/Filed/PDF">HB 1127</a> [text, PDF], requires that an ultrasound be performed prior to an abortion and that the individual performing the procedure offer the woman the opportunity to view the live ultrasound images and hear an explanation of the images. The bill also provides that a woman has the right to decline to view the images but only after signing a form acknowledging that the opportunity was presented to her. Additionally, there is an exception to the requirement that a woman be informed of her right to view the images if she is seeking an abortion as a result of having been the victim of rape, incest, domestic violence, or human trafficking. The second bill signed by Scott, <a href="http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/1247/BillText/Filed/PDF">HB 1247</a> [text, PDF], relates to parental notice of abortions sought by minors. In addition to revising the definition of constructive notice required if actual notice of a parent is not possible, the bill also affects the ability of a minor to obtain a court waiver from the parental notification law. Prior to passage of the bill, a court was required to rule on the minor's petition within 48 hours. Now, however, the court has three business days after the petition is filed to hand down its ruling. If it fails to rule within the three day period, the minor can petition for a hearing, which may require another 48 hours of waiting. Just over one year ago, former Governor Charlie Crist <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/florida-governor-vetos-bill-requiring-ultrasounds-for-abortions.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a bill with requirements similar to that of HB 1127.

<p>Florida is not alone in its quest to restrict access to abortions. Earlier this month, the Iowa House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">voted in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy, making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. The House's bill significantly amends a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/SF534_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [SF-534 text, PDF] previously introduced by the state Senate and would ban abortions after the beginning of the gestation period, which occurs at a woman's last period before her pregnancy, thus potentially banning abortions as early as 18 weeks. There is no exception in the bill for the health of the mother, although there is for her life. In May, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/index.htm">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota <a href="http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2011/Bill.aspx?Bill=1217">law</a> [HB 1217 materials] requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. The law, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://sd.gov/governor/">Governor Dennis Daugaard</a> [official website] in March, is set to take effect July 1 and would impose the longest waiting period in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision handed down by <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/judges/bio_TWP.htm">Judge Tanya Walton Pratt</a> [official profile] prevents application of the portion of the law that bans contracts between state agencies and any entity that performs abortions or maintains a facility where abortions are performed. This ban includes disbursement of grant money, including federal Medicare funds, a provision PPIN claims is not legal under the federal Medicaid Act's "freedom of choice" provision, which allows states to disallow Medicare funding for medical providers based on deficiencies in quality of service. The court's decision is not the final word in the case, but it finds that PPIN has demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success for its contention that HEA 1210 is illegal under federal law:<blockquote>Unquestionably, states have authority to exclude medical providers from participating in Medicaid under some circumstances. The question then becomes whether this is one of those circumstances. ... [I]t is well-settled that the "freedom of choice" provision does not give Medicaid recipients an absolutely unfettered right to choose their healthcare provider. ... The defunding provision, however, renders PPIN "unqualified" to serve as a Medicaid provider because, separate and apart from its basic health care services, PPIN also performs abortions. Thus, the question arises: Can Indiana pick and choose Medicaid providers based on the range of medical services they provide?</blockquote> In her opinion Pratt noted that PPIN's likelihood of success is supported by the language of various provisions in the Medicaid statutes and applicable case law, along with the federal government's recent rejection of Indiana's proposed amendment to its Medicaid plan.

<p>Last month, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-indiana-planned-parenthood-cuts.php">refused to block the law</a> [JURIST report] upon passage. But Friday's ruling is in line with a recent US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] brief that <a href="http://www.mainjustice.com/files/2011/06/Planned-Parenthood-DOJ-Filing.pdf">urged the court to grant an injunction</a> [brief, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-indiana-ban-on-medicaid-funds-to-abortion-providers-violates-federal-law.php">stop the enforcement of the Indiana law</a> [JURIST report], which went into effect in May. The brief echoed arguments made earlier this month by the Obama administration, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">argued against the law</a> [JURIST report] in a letter to the state, which is one of several to have acted recently to tighten restrictions on abortions. Last month, Planned Parenthood and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging a South Dakota law requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that would have restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas Governor Rick Perry signed a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">first get a sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/iowa-house-passes-ban-on-abortions-performed-after-20-weeks.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontisrael.jpg " alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Israel issued a warning to the international media on Sunday, threatening deportation and a 10-year ban from the country for any foreign journalist caught on board an aid flotilla headed for the Gaza Strip. The Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/PM+Office/Departments/GPO.htm">Government Press Office</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jDPIeiu3Nejj6-YNgfSo9n8fttSQ?docId=c9bd6524eae44f2fbc55b410d902c073">issued a letter to foreign journalists</a> [AP report] reportedly calling the flotilla a dangerous provocation by extremists and an intentional violation of Israeli law. The letter warned that in addition to a ban from the country, participants in the flotilla may face equipment seizures and other sanctions. The aid flotilla will violate Israel's naval blockade and thus the Israeli government considers it a threat to national security. The Gaza naval blockade began in 2007 after <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8968/">Hamas</a> [CFR backgrounder], designated as a <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm">terrorist organization</a> [text] by the US State Department, was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2006/01/palestinian-pm-resigns-after-hamas.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] as the ruling party of the Palestinian Authority. The blockade was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-rights-council-condemns-israel-attack-and-calls-for-independent-investigation.php">violated last year by a similar aid flotilla</a> [JURIST report], resulting in an Israeli commando raid that left nine dead and many wounded. The Turkish ship on which the violence <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/International/israeli-commandos-storm-gaza-aid-convoy-international-condemnation/story?id=10788664">occurred</a> [ABC report] was one of six <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/31/q-a-gaza-freedom-flotilla">organized</a> [<em>Guardian</em> backgrounder] by the <a href="http://www.freegaza.org/">Free Gaza Movement</a> [advocacy website] to carry protesters and humanitarian supplies to the isolated Palestinian enclave. Journalist groups have responded with condemnation of the Israeli government's warning against participating in this year's flotilla, demanding that the government rescind its threats and allow journalists to cover a legitimate news event.

<p>Israel has faced ongoing criticism from the UN and international human rights groups for its action in the Palestinian territories, which have been under Israeli military control since 1967. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] this month <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11117&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press release] the killings of between 30 and 40 protesters had been killed by Israeli security forces along the ceasefire line between occupied borders. Nearly <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/israeli-forces-kill-18-protesters-syrian-tv-043810558.html">20 civilian protesters were reportedly killed</a> [Reuters report] during a protest on June 5 marking the anniversary of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/mideast/history/history4.html">1967 Middle East war</a> [NPR backgrounder]. In January, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/un-official-expresses-concern-over-violence-against-palestinians.php">UN official alleged</a> [JURIST report] that Israeli authorities had <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=10633&LangID=E">committed several illegal acts</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/oPt.html">Palestinian territories</a> [UNICEF backgrounder] since the start of the year, making the prospect of a viable Palestinian state unlikely. In June 2010, Israeli human rights group <a href="http://www.btselem.org/">B'Tselem</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/palestinian-rights-advance-in-2009-but-need-improvement-report.php">released its annual report</a> [JURIST report], noting an advancement in the rights of Palestinians, but calling for greater improvement. The report found that fatalities had declined by 80 percent compared to the previous year, and the quality of life had improved in the West Bank. The report called on Israel to dismantle all settlements, saying that merely halting new settlements is insufficient. The rights organization also chided Israeli security forces for not adequately protecting Palestinians from violence at the hands of Israelis, criticizing a "history of leniency" against the perpetrators of that violence. In March 2010, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-illegal-west.php">called Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank "illegal"</a> [JURIST report], and supported a plan by Palestinian Authority <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6757273.stm">Prime Minister Salam Fayyad</a> [BBC profile] to build the institutions of an independent state by 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/structure%20of%20the%20court/chambers/pre%20trial%20division/pre%20trial%20division?lan=en-GB">Pre-Trial Chamber I</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/CIS-Gaddafi-Eng.pdf">issued warrants</a> [press release] for <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099321.pdf">Gaddafi</a>, his son <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a>, the "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister," and his brother-in-law <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099332.pdf">Abdullah al-Sanussi</a> [warrants, PDF], the head of intelligence, for alleged crimes against the people of Libya to quell the revolt that began last February. Based on the materials provided to the Chamber by the Prosecutor's office, the Chamber found reasonable grounds that between February 15 and February 28, 2011, Gaddafi not only conspired with the other two to perpetrate crimes against humanity against the people of Libya but took actions to cover-up the crimes. The Chamber noted:<blockquote>There is also information which indicates that there was a campaign to cover up the alleged crimes through the following acts: (i) targeting journalists to prevent them from reporting events, and punishing them for having done so; (ii) repeatedly blocking satellite transmission of channels such as Al-Jazeera and Al-Hurra and disrupting internet and telecommunications services; (iii) confiscating laptops, cameras, mobile phones SD and SIM cards from persons stopped at checkpoints; (iv) removing dead bodies by the Security Forces including from the hospitals" and throwing of at least one body into a rubbish truck in Tripoli; (v) searching for wounded protesters in the Tripoli hospital; and (vi) leveling to the ground a Mosque which bore bullet holes as a result of an attack by the Security Forces in Al- Zawiyah; and (vii) removing evidence of mass graves in Al-Zawiyah."</blockquote> Libya is not a signatory of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] granting the ICC its jurisdiction, and Gaddafi has refused to recognize its authority. Still, the Chamber noted that, "the official position of an individual, whether he or she is a national of a State party or of a State which is not party to the Statute, has no effect on the Court's jurisdiction."

<p>Last week, ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official website] presented the materials to Pre-Trial Chamber. He said his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">gathered "direct evidence"</a> [JURIST report] that shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protestors and that his forces used live ammunition on crowds, attacked civilians in their homes, used heavy weapons against people in funeral processions and placed snipers to shoot those leaving mosques after prayer services. Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] last month that his office was pursuing arrest warrants against Gaddafi and the two others in his "inner circle." He said Saif al-Islam was acting as Gaddafi's "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister" and called al-Sanussi Gaddafi's "right-hand man" and "executioner." At that time, Moreno-Ocampo said his office was almost prepared for trial, having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes and human rights violations over the Libyan revolt which has persisted since February. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 14th Criminal Chamber of the Tunis Court of Appeal <a href="http://www.tap.info.tn/en/en/politics/3564-imed-trabelsi-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison-and-3000-dinar-fine-.html">sentenced Trabelsi to four years in prison</a> [TAP report] and ordered him to pay a 3,000-dinar fine after being convicted on charges of possession and consumption of drugs. Trabelsi, who was arrested after Ben Ali fled the country to Saudi Arabia in January, appealed his conviction in May when he was initially sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay a 2,000-dinar fine by the Court of First Instance of Tunis. A spokesman for the Justice Ministry said <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110625/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_tunisia_trabelsi_trial_1">he will eventually stand trial</a> [AP report] on other charges including corruption, fraud and illegal trafficking of archaeological items.

<p>Tunisia has been cracking down on the family of Ben Ali since the ousted president fled the country in January amidst protests ending his 23-year autocratic rule in which his family amassed substantial wealth that many Tunisians say was at their expense. Last week, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/nephew-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-15-years-in-absentia.php">Tunisian court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] <em>in absentia</em> Sofiane Ben Ali, another nephew of Ben Ali, to 15 years in prison for issuing bad checks totaling more than USD $430,000. That same week, Ben Ali and his wife were <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-35-years-in-absentia.php">convicted <em>in absentia</em></a> and sentenced to 35 years in prison on charges of theft and unlawful possession of money and jewelry just hours after the trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/trial-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-begins-in-absentia.php">began that morning</a> [JURIST reports]. The two were also charged with illegal possession of drugs and weapons, but the verdict for those charges would not be announced until June 30. Ben Ali said <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col=">he was "duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis, according to a statement released through his lawyer. He said that he was trying to get his family out of the country after assassination threats and that the plane left him in Saudi Arabia despite orders to wait for him. Ben Ali has <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">denied the charges against him</a> [JURIST report], most of which stem from allegations he authorized the use of force against protesters during the protests, resulting in more than 200 deaths.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1293.htm">FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Brief-05-31-11-134838.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will rule on whether the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] current indecency enforcement regime violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First</a> or <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution. The FCC <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-petitions-supreme-court-to-reinstate-fcc-indecency-policy.php">sought Supreme Court review</a> after the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled last year that the FCC's indecency policy, which places restrictions on profanity and nudity during television broadcasting, is <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-fcc-indecency-policy-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutionally vague</a> [JURIST reports] and could have a "chilling effect" on speech. The case hinges on indecency issues raised in two separate broadcasts, one in which a nudity scene appeared in a television crime show during prime-time hours, and the other involving celebrities using expletives during live broadcasting events. The Supreme Court originally remanded the case to the Second Circuit after <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/supreme-court-upholds-fcc-ban-on.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] in April 2009 that the FCC did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in changing its policy regarding fines for the broadcast of isolated expletives. That ruling overturned a previous <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/federal-appeals-court-overturns-fcc.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the Second Circuit, which held that the 2004 policy was arbitrary and capricious under the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/">Administrative Procedure Act</a> [text] for failing to articulate a reasoned basis for its change in policy. The Supreme Court declined to address the constitutionality of the FCC policy in its decision and remanded the case to the lower court for further consideration of the constitutional issue.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1259.htm">United States v.

The federal government <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/government-asks-supreme-court-to-rule-on-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">sought Supreme Court review</a> [JURIST report] after the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/201008/08-3030-1259298.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">report</a>] last year that prolonged use of GPS to monitor suspects' vehicles violates the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-224.htm">National Meat Association v. Harris</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/01-14-National-Meat-Association-petition-for-cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether a California law requiring slaughterhouses to "immediately euthanize" any nonambulatory animal on its premises is preempted by the <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&_Policies/Federal_Meat_Inspection_Act/index.asp">Federal Meat Inspection Act</a> (FMIA) [text]. The provisions of the California law were considered and expressly rejected by federal regulators because they eliminate certain federally required ante-mortem inspection of possibly diseased animals. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/31/09-15483.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the California law was not preempted. The questions before the court are (1) Did the Ninth Circuit err in holding that a "presumption against preemption" requires a "narrow interpretation" of the FMIA's express preemption provision, in conflict with the court's decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/430/519/">Jones v. Rath Packing Co.</a> [opinion text] that the provision must be given "a broad meaning"?; (2) Where federal food safety and humane handling regulations specify that animals (here, swine) which are or become nonambulatory on federally-inspected premises are to be separated and held for observation and further disease inspection, did the Ninth Circuit err in holding that a state criminal law which requires that such animals not be held for observation and disease inspection, but instead be immediately euthanized, was not preempted by the FMIA?; and (3) Did the Ninth Circuit err in holding more generally that a state criminal law which states that no slaughterhouse may buy, sell, receive, process, butcher, or hold a nonambulatory animal is not a preempted attempt to regulate the "premises, facilities, [or] operations" of federally-regulated slaughterhouses. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-704.htm">Messerschmidt v. Millender</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Cert.-in-Messerschmidt.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will consider whether police officers are entitled to <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity">qualified immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] where they execute search warrants later determined invalid. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/08/24/07-55518.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the officers in this case were not entitled to qualified immunity.

Briggs</a> [opinions text] that officers are entitled to qualified immunity, and evidence obtained should not be suppressed, so long as the warrant is not "so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable." The questions before the court are (1) Under these standards, are officers entitled to qualified immunity where they obtained a facially valid warrant to search for firearms, firearm-related materials, and gang-related items in the residence of a gang member and felon who had threatened to kill his girlfriend and fired a sawed-off shotgun at her, and a district attorney approved the application, no factually on-point case law prohibited the search, and the alleged overbreadth in the warrant did not expand the scope of the search; and (2) Should the Malley/Leon standards be reconsidered or clarified in light of lower courts' inability to apply them in accordance with their purpose of deterring police misconduct, resulting in imposition of liability on officers for good faith conduct and improper exclusion of evidence in criminal cases?</p>

When the US <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">Patent and Trademark Office</a> (PTO) [official website] denies an application for a patent, the applicant may seek judicial review of the agency's final action through either of two avenues.

Alternatively, the applicant may commence a civil action against the Director of the PTO in federal district court under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_145.htm">35 USC &#167; 145</a> [text] The court will decide whether a plaintiff in a &#167; 145 action may introduce new evidence that could have been presented to the agency in the first instance. The court will also consider whether, when new evidence is introduced under &#167; 145, the district court may decide de novo the factual questions to which the evidence pertains, without giving deference to the prior decision of the PTO. The Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/07-1066.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that "&#167; 145 imposes no limitation on an applicant's right to introduce new evidence before the district court."</p>

<p>In <a href="Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S">Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S</a> [docket; <a href="Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. v. Novo Nordisk A/S">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will rule on drug patents. When the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] approves a drug for multiple uses, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drug makers to avoid contested patent litigation by marketing generic versions of the drug solely for non-patented uses. The FDA lacks the authority and expertise needed to verify the patent information submitted by name-brand drug companies, however, so it defers to their descriptions of the scope of their patents. Such companies can therefore block the approval of generic drugs by submitting overbroad patent descriptions to the FDA, effectively extending their patents to cover non-infringing uses. To combat this problem, the Act <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/usc_sec_21_00000355----000-.html">allows</a> [21 USC &#167; 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I) text] a "counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [patent] holder to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the holder on the ground that the patent does not claim an approved method of using the drug." The Federal Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/03-25-Caraco-Opinion-below.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the counterclaim provision effectively authorizes only "delet[ing]" improperly listed patents, but not "correct[ing]" information that misrepresents the scope of the approved uses claimed by a patent. Petitioners claim that ruling expressly invalidates longstanding FDA regulations defining "patent information," which the FDA deems "essential" to administering the Act, without seeking the agency&#8217;s views. The question before the court is whether the counterclaim provision applies when (1) there is "an approved method of using the drug" that "the patent does not claim," and (2) the brand submits "patent information" to the FDA that misstates the patent&#8217;s scope, requiring "correct[ion]."</p>

The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/201012077.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that federal courts lack jurisdiction over private actions under the Act. </p>

The verdict was <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/197357/bangladesh-jails-657-mutineers/">unprecedented in the number of people convicted</a> [AFP report] at once and brings the total number of soldiers jailed for the mutiny to over 3,000. The court originally charged 667 guards from the <a href="http://www.bdr.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Rifles</a> (BDR) [official website] with nine being acquitted and one dying during the trial. One hundred eight guards received the maximum seven-year sentence the court could issue. Bangladesh has conducted a series of military and civil trials for the thousands of citizens and soldiers involved in the mutiny, which left 74 dead. The military court is part of dozens of courts set up to try members of the 2009 mutiny. It does not allow defendants to have lawyers and there is no right to appeal. 

<p>Last January, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/bangladesh-court-opens-trial-of-800-soldiers-charged-in-2009-mutiny.php">civilian trial of 800 soldiers charged</a> [JURIST report] with crimes stemming from their roles in the 2009 mutiny began in the capital city of Dhaka. The trial involves some of the most serious charges with those found guilty facing the death penalty. The trial is expected to last over a year and to include the testimonies of more than 1,000 individuals. In August 2010, a special Bangladeshi military court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bangladesh-court-convicts-14-border-guards-in-mutiny-trial.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] 14 members of the BDR for their roles in the mutiny. The tribunal, led by BDR head Maj. Gen. Mainul Islam, fined each of the men Tk 100 and <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=169661&cid=2">sentenced</a> [BDNews24 report] them to prison terms ranging from four months to six years, one year short of the maximum possible sentence for rebellion under Bangladeshi law. About 3,500 other soldiers will face lesser charges in military courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Brown</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-over-personal-jurisdiction-of-foreign-companies.php">report</a>] that foreign subsidiaries of the American corporation <a href="http://www.goodyear.com/">Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company</a> [corporate website] are subject to neither specific nor general personal jurisdiction in North Carolina. Two North Carolina teenagers were killed in a bus accident in France when a tire manufactured in Turkey malfunctioned. The boys' parents initiated a wrongful death lawsuit against Goodyear and the petitioners, three Goodyear subsidiaries, organized and operated in Luxembourg, Turkey and France. The <a href="http://www.nccourts.org/courts/appellate/appeal/">North Carolina Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/coa/opinions/2009/pdf/080944-1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the defendants were subject to general personal jurisdiction in North Carolina. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, reversed the lower court, holding that North Carolina lacks personal jurisdiction over the foreign subsidiaries. Because the cause of action does not arise out of or relate to any contacts between the suit and the forum state, the North Carolina court lacked specific jurisdiction. Furthermore, the court refused to recognize that the state court had general personal jurisdiction over the matter:<blockquote>A connection so limited between the forum and the foreign corporation, we hold, is an inadequate basis for the exercise of general jurisdiction. Such a connection does not establish the "continuous and systematic" affiliation necessary to empower North Carolina courts to entertain claims unrelated to the foreign corporation's contacts with the State.</blockquote>The court relied primarily on <span class="casename">International Shoe Co. v. Washington</span>, which provides that state courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has "certain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'" The petitioners manufacture their tires primarily for European and Asian markets, and the tires differ in size and construction from tires ordinarily sold in the US. Furthermore, the petitioners are not registered to do business in North Carolina, have no place of business, employees, or bank accounts in the state, do not design, manufacture, or advertise their products in the state, do not solicit business in the state, and do not sell or ship tires to North Carolina customers. A small percentage of their tires were distributed in North Carolina by other Goodyear affiliates, however. Based on these circumstances, the court concluded, the respondents had failed to show that the petitioners placed their tires in the North Carolina "stream of commerce" such that the state court had personal jurisdiction over the matter.

<p>The respondents had argued in their <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_10_76_Respondent.authcheckdam.pdf">merits brief</a> [text, PDF] that refusing to find jurisdiction over foreign subsidiaries of US corporations would encourage outsourcing to avoid litigation in the US. The petitioners <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/preview/publiced_preview_briefs_pdfs_09_10_10_76_Petitioner.authcheckdam.pdf">argued</a> [merits brief, PDF] that a finding of personal jurisdiction would invite forum shopping and deter interstate and foreign commerce. The Supreme Court did not address either of these arguments in its opinion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Entertainment Merchants Association</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-violent-video-game-law.php">report</a>] that a California ban on the sale of violent video games to minors violates the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. <a href="http://law.justia.com/california/codes/civ/1746-1746.5.html">California Civil Code sections 1746-1746.5</a> [text] sought to prohibit the sale of violent video games to minors where a reasonable person would find that: the violent content appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors; the content is patently offensive to prevailing community standards as to what is suitable for minors; and the content causes the game as a whole to lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value for minors. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court ruled that the law does not meet the strict scrutiny standard for limiting free speech. Scalia stated that the violent content of video games is clearly protected, disagreeing with California's argument that violent content is obscene and thus unprotected:<blockquote>California&#8217;s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously overinclusive. As a means of protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harm-less pastime. And the overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.</blockquote>Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts concurred with striking down the law (for vagueness), but called for a more narrowly tailored law to suppress violent video game purchases by minors. Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer each filed dissents. Thomas argued that the original understanding of the First Amendment did not include the rights for minors to speak or be spoken to. Breyer would uphold the law as fulfilling a compelling government interest&#8212;aiding parental duties and protecting the well-being of youth&#8212;under strict scrutiny. He also argued that the restriction in question was a modest restriction that should be upheld.

<p>The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/supreme-court-to-rule-on-banning-violent-video-game-sales-to-minors.php">agreed to hear the case</a> last year after the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ninth-circuit-rules-ban-on-video-game.php">struck down the ban</a> [JURIST reports] as unconstitutional. The bill, originally signed into law by then-California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in October 2005, prohibited the sale or rental of violent video games to minors under the age of 17, and required retailers to label violent games. In December 2005, US District Court Judge Ronald Whyte issued a <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/industry-groups-sue-over-california.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the enforcement of the law after the <a href="http://www.theesa.com/">Entertainment Software Association</a> (ESA) and the <a href="http://www.idealink.org/Resource.phx/public/aboutvsda.htx">Video Software Dealers Association</a> (VSDA) [trade websites] <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/industry-groups-sue-over-california.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report].

Bennett</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that an Arizona campaign finance regulation that provided publicly financed candidates with additional government subsidies, which are triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates or by the candidates' privately financed opponents, violates the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The court held 5-4 that such a system substantially burdens political speech and is not sufficiently justified by a compelling state interest to satisfy the First Amendment. The <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/ArizonaRevisedStatutes.asp?Title=16">Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act</a> [Ariz Rev Stat Ann &#167; 16-940 <em>et. seq.</em>] provided a system by which candidates running for state office could opt into a public financing scheme. Under the scheme, the candidate would agree to follow certain campaign finance restrictions and agree to other things like participating in a public debate in exchange for receiving an allotment of public funds for the campaign. Under the Act, candidates participating in the public financing scheme would receive matching funds for every dollar a privately funded candidate spent over the original public allotment, less 6 percent accounting for fund raising expenses. The scheme allowed for a situation where if a group spent $1,000 publishing a brochure supporting one privately-funded candidate then a publicly-funded candidate would receive $940, but if the brochure supported the publicly-funded candidate the privately-funded candidate receives nothing. The court held that such a scheme is substantially burdensome on the privately-funded candidates because it harms them for exercising First Amendment rights to raise and/or spend their own money on their campaign. The court said that it has never held that the state's interest in leveling the playing field is enough to suppress or alter political speech. Justice Elena Kagan wrote the dissent, joined by three others, disagreeing that the finance system was a substantial burden and that the state's interest was justified based on ensuring the legitimacy and public trust in the election system. She wrote:<blockquote>The First Amendment's core purpose is to foster a healthy, vibrant political system full of robust discussion and debate. Nothing in Arizona's anti-corruption statute, the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act, violates this constitutional protection. To the contrary, the Act promotes the values underlying both the First Amendment and our entire Constitution by enhancing the "opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people."</blockquote>The majority opinion was authored by Chief Justice John Roberts.

<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-arizona-campaign-finance-scheme.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in March. Counsel for the respondent argued that "public funding of elections results in more speech and more electoral competition" and furthers a governmental interest of combating "real and apparent corruption in politics." Further, that public funding combats corruption by freeing candidates from the "need to accept potentially corrupting private contributions," and allows for more candidates to run, "more political speech, and more electoral competition." Arizona's matching funds system both promoted speech and encouraged candidates to run against incumbents. The government argued, as amicus curiae, supporting the respondents that the matching funds provision "provides a formula for giving the publicly funded candidate as much money as the privately funded candidate." The government agreed that public financing facilitated speech and allowed candidates to run on the same footing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Robert Nicastro alleged that he was injured by a defective metal-shearing machine manufactured in the UK by <a href="http://www.jmcintyre.co.uk/">J McIntyre Machinery, Ltd.</a> [corporate website] and sold in the US. McIntyre is incorporated in the UK and sells its machines in the US through a separate company distributor. The <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">Supreme Court of New Jersey</a> [official website] <a href="http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/courts/supreme/a-29-08.opn.html">held</a> [opinion text] that McIntyre was subject to specific personal jurisdiction in New Jersey for injuries sustained there under a "stream of commerce" theory where the company knew or reasonably should have known that its products would be sold throughout the US. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the plurality opinion, relying on Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/480/102/">Asahi Metal Industries v. Superior Court</a> [opinion text], holding that McIntyre had not sufficiently directed its business toward New Jersey to subject it to personal jurisdiction:<blockquote>Recall that respondent's claim of jurisdiction centers on three facts: The distributor agreed to sell J. McIntyre's machines in the United States; J. McIntyre officials attended trade shows in several States but not in New Jersey; and up to four machines ended up in New Jersey.  The British manufacturer had no office in New Jersey; it neither paid taxes nor owned property there; and it neither advertised in, nor sent any employees to, the State.  Indeed, after discovery the trial court found that the defendant does not have a single contact with New Jersey short of the machine in question ending up in this state. These facts may reveal an intent to serve the U.S. market, but they do not show that J. McIntyre purposefully availed itself of the New Jersey market.</blockquote>Justice Stephen Breyer concurred, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, deprived the plurality of a majority opinion agreeing that McIntyre was not subject to personal jurisdiction but limited his decision to prior precedent. Breyer warned that the court should refrain from going any further because this case "does not implicate modern concerns, and because the factual record leaves many open questions, this is an unsuitable vehicle for making broad refashion basic jurisdictional rules." Three justices dissented in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's arguing a foreign company that sells its products in the US without restriction should not be able to avoid liability for deficient products simply because it uses a separate US distributor. 

<p>The Supreme Court also decided another personal jurisdiction issueMonday . The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-76.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-76">Goodyear v. Brown</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] that foreign subsidiaries of the American corporation <a href="http://www.goodyear.com/">Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company</a> [corporate website] are subject to neither specific nor general personal jurisdiction in North Carolina. In that case, two North Carolina teenagers were killed in a bus accident in France when a tire manufactured in Turkey malfunctioned. Opposite McIntyre, in that case Justice Ginsburgh wrote the majority opinion holding that North Carolina lacked specific personal jurisdiction over the foreign subsidiaries, because the cause of action did not arise out of or relate to any contacts between the suit and the forum state. Further, the court held there was no general personal jurisdiction because there was no "continuous and systematic" affiliation with North Carolina.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The jury <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-the-counts-against-blagojevich-20110627,0,1145134.story">convicted</a> [count tally] Blagojevich of right counts of wire fraud and on counts of extortion conspiracy, attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit bribery in connection with the sale of a US Senate seat. However, the jury <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-blagojevich-jurors-going-into-their-10th-day-20110627,0,620170.story">remained deadlocked</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] on a charge of attempted extortion for solicitation of then-congressman Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obama's chief of staff before being elected Mayor of Chicago. The jury began deliberating on June 10. Blagojevich was previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] last year of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on 23 additional charges. The prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dropped some of the charges</a> [JURIST report] to simplify the case for retrial including charges for racketeering. Prosecutors also dropped charges against Blagojevich's brother, his chief fundraiser. Blagojevich had tried to avoid the trial in March, but a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-declines-to-rule-on-blagojevich-cancel-trial-request.php">declined to formally rule</a> on his <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/blagojevich-asks-judge-to-cancel-retrial.php">request to cancel the trial</a> [JURIST reports], saying that the motion was neither serious, nor did it raise a legal question. Blagojevich's lawyers had submitted a <a href="http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2011/03/blagojevichs-motion-to-dismiss-plain-text-version.html">motion</a> [text] to cancel the ex-governor's retrial and sentence him only on the single charge on which he was originally convicted.

<p>In Blagojevich's first trial, the jury deliberated for 14 days after the 11-week trial but was unable to reach a consensus on all but one of the charges. According to reports, there was a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/blagojevich/ct-met-blagojevich-verdict-jury-20100818,0,1234825.story">lone holdout</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] on the convictions regarding the sale of Obama's Senate seat. The female juror allegedly stated that due to the lack of a "smoking gun" she was unable to convict Blagojevich of the crimes. Last September, lawyers for Blagojevich asked the judge to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/blagojevich-asks-judge-to-override-false-statements-conviction.php">throw out the sole conviction</a> [JURIST report], stating that the government failed to meet its required burden of proof and that cross-examinations by the defense were <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/blagojevich-on-trial/2010/09/blagojevich-lawyers-seek-to-throw-out-conviction-cite-plethora-of-errors.html">plagued by "obstructionist" objections</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report], which the court continuously sustained. In January 2009, the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office. Blagojevich and his former chief of staff John Harris were initially <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Juvenile Male</span> that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had no authority to rule that the requirements of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h109-4905">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006</a> (SORNA) [text] violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/ex_post_facto">ex post facto</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] clause of the Constitution when applied to juveniles adjudicated as delinquent before SORNA's enactment. The Supreme Court in a <em>per curiam</em> <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-940.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-no-child-left-behind-challenge.php">report</a>] issued last year sent a certified question to the <a href="http://www.courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] seeking to determine if there was still a live controversy in the case because the challenged federal sex offender registration had expired. The certified question asked whether the ongoing sex offender registration required under state law is dependent upon the defendant's former federal sex offender registration, which would indicate a live dispute, or is required independent of federal law, rendering the <em>ex post facto</em> claim moot. The Supreme Court held that the <em>ex post facto</em> claim was moot because the defendant's "state law duty to remain registered as a sex offender is not contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his federal supervision order, but is an independent requirement of Montana law." Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor would remand the case to the Ninth Circuit for the court to consider mootness in the first instance. Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the decision.

<p>The defendant was found delinquent by the US District Court for the District of Montana in 2005 after pleading "true" to engaging in sex acts with a minor under 12, and was later required to register as a sex offender under SORNA. On appeal, the defendant challenged this registration on <em>ex post facto</em> grounds in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8150476954823504107&amp;q=590+F.+3d+924&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=800000000002">ruled</a> [opinion text] in favor of the defendant, finding an <em>ex post facto</em> violation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Mujica, who fought the military rule as a <a href="http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/article/2009-11-30-Che-Guevaras-spiritual-heir">guerilla fighter</a> [Daily Maverick report], will issue a decree later this week revoking administrative acts issued by the executive branch under the <a href = "http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/leyes/AccesoTextoLey.asp?Ley=15848">1986 Expiry Law</a> [text, in Spanish] which granted amnesty to military officials accused of human rights violations during military rule. Breccia said that it will be up to the courts to determine how to proceed once the administrative acts are revoked. He referred to an <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?&CFID=666614&CFTOKEN=69520161">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website, in Spanish] ruling in March that the amnesty law not block investigations into human rights violations. However, public referenda to overturn the law have failed twice. Last month, Uruguay's <a href="http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/palacio3/index1280.asp?e=0&w=1600">House of Representatives</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/uruguay-fails-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">failed to partially overturn</a> the amnesty law in a tie vote after it had <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/uruguay-senate-votes-to-overturn-1986-amnesty-law.php">already been repealed</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://www.parlamento.gub.uy/palacio3/index1280.asp?e=0&w=1600">Senate</a> [official website, in Spanish]. In November, the <a href = "http://www.poderjudicial.gub.uy/servlet/page?_pageid=56&_dad=portal30&_schema=PORTAL30&_type=site&_fsiteid=34&_fid=4550&_fnavbarid=1&_fnavbarsiteid=34&_fedit=0&_fmode=2&_fdisplaymode=1&_fcalledfrom=1&_fdisplayurl=">Uruguayan Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] <a href = "/paperchase/2010/11/uruguay-high-court-annuls-dictatorship-amnesty.php">found the law to be unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Mujicia, a leftist Senator and farmer, was elected to the presidency in a close election in November 2009. He co-founded the Tupamaro movement, an urban guerrilla force that opposed the military junta. Prior to November's judgment, Uruguay's Supreme Court had largely upheld the amnesty <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-high-court-overturns-amnesty.php">except in extreme circumstances</a>, and in 2009 a popular vote <a href = "/paperchase/2009/10/uruguay-voters-reject-referendum-to-end.php">failed to overturn the law</a> [JURIST reports]. Many of the alleged kidnappings and deaths occurred in connection with <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3720724.stm">Operation Condor</a> [BBC backgrounder], a cooperative effort between the governments of Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil and Chile to eliminate left-wing political opponents. In June, ex-military officials in Argentina were <a href = "/paperchase/2010/06/argentina-ex-military-officials-go-on-trial-for-dirty-war-crimes.php">put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for the deaths of 65 activists in connection with Operation Condor. The Uruguayan government has also attempted to bring those responsible for the disappearance of leftist activist to justice. In 2006, eight former police and military officers were <a href = "/paperchase/2006/09/uruguay-indicts-8-for-operation-condor.php">indicted by a Uruguayan court</a> [JURIST report] on counts of kidnapping and conspiracy committed during the 1973-1985 dictatorship. The crimes were related to the 1976 disappearances of five members of an Uruguayan leftist group who fled to Argentina and were detained there by police, and who investigators suspect were victims of Operation Condor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Thomas Thrash issued a preliminary injunction at the request of the plaintiffs, including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> (NILC) [advocacy websites] and other rights groups, which filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/pi_brief_-_final.pdf">motion for preliminary injunction</a> [text, PDF] in early June to block the Georgia immigration law from going into effect. The motion came one week after the groups <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/gacomplaint_20110602.pdf">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/aclu-files-lawsuit-challenging-georgia-immigration-law.php">report</a>] in the district court against the bill. Thrash dismissed the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment, due process, equal protection and right to travel claims, but indicated that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on their Supremacy Clause and preemption claims. Thrash granted the injunction request for sections 7 and 8 of HB 87, saying that the plaintiffs would face irreparable harm should the law take effect and that the public interest weighed in favor of issuing the injunction. The bill, which was scheduled to take effect on July 1, allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in criminal investigations. The law also imposes fines and prison sentences of up to one year for anyone who knowingly transports illegal immigrants during the commission of a crime, and requires businesses to use the federal <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system to check the immigration status of potential employees, providing that workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment could face up to 15 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

<p>The Georgia suit does not mark the first time the ACLU and other groups have taken legal action against immigration laws in recent months. Last month, the ACLU filed a class action suit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/aclu-files-class-action-suit-against-indiana-immigration-law.php">challenging an Indiana immigration law</a> [JURIST report] that requires individuals to provide proof of their legal status at all times and calls for all public meetings, websites and documents to be in English only. Also last month, the ACLU and other groups filed a class action suit <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">against a Utah immigration law</a> [JURIST report] that requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. Federal judges have enjoined both the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-enjoins-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">Utah</a> laws [JURIST reports]. Similar legislation has been approved in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/virginia-ag-rules-police-may-inquire-about-immigration-status.php">Virginia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-senate-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Oklahoma</a> [JURIST reports]. Arizona's legislation, <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/arizona-governor-signs-controversial.php">signed into law last April</a>, is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">enjoined</a>, and Governor Jan Brewer has <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-ask-supreme-court-to-lift-injunction-on-controversial-immigration-law.php">pledged to appeal to the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justin Cannon was convicted in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Norfolk, VA in March, along with Christopher Drotleff, for involuntary manslaughter. Drotleff was sentenced to 37 months in prison earlier this month. They are the <a href="http://hamptonroads.com/2011/06/2nd-exblackwater-worker-gets-30-months-manslaughter">first contractors</a> [<em>Virginia-Pilot</em> report] for the North Carolina-based company to be sentenced to prison for killing a civilian in a war zone. Prosecutors alleged that the two men left their military base without authorization while intoxicated and opened fire into the back of a civilian car after a traffic accident. The driver of the car and a civilian bystander were killed, and a passenger in the car was wounded. Cannon and Drotleff claim that they were defending themselves and that they were not drinking. They were facing a maximum sentence of eight years in prison. Both men were only convicted on the involuntary manslaughter count for the death of the driver, while being acquitted of two counts of second-degree murder, assault resulting in serious bodily injury to the passenger and firearms offenses. US District Judge Robert Doumar was unsympathetic to the two men's argument that they were operating under the dangerous conditions of a war zone. He <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/7628824.html">said the men were lucky</a> [AP report] to have good court-appointed attorneys that were able to avoid murder convictions. Cannon's attorneys said they planned to appeal the manslaughter conviction.

<p>Cannon and Drotleff were <a href="http://www.justice.gov/criminal/pr/documents/01-07-10Cannon-Drotleff-Indictment.pdf">originally indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] in January 2010, but were charged under the <a href="http://www.pubklaw.com/hi/pl106-523.pdf">Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act</a> [text, PDF] in a superseding indictment in August. They were initially tried in September, but the judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-declares-mistrial-in-murder-case-against-blackwater-contractors.php">declared a mistrial</a> [JURIST report] after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Earlier this month, four former Blackwater contractors <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/blackwater-guards-challenge-reinstatement-of-manslaughter-case.php">appealed</a> the April decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-case-against-blackwater-guards.php">reinstate</a> manslaughter charges against them in connection with their alleged roles in a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">2007 shooting incident</a> [JURIST reports] in Baghdad, Iraq. In April 2010, a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-blackwater-executives-indicted.php">indicted five former Blackwater executives</a> [JURIST report] on charges of weapons violations and lying to investigators. In February 2010, the Iraqi government ordered 250 former Blackwater employees to <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">leave Iraq</a> [JURIST report] in reaction to the dismissal of charges against former Blackwater employees <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/blackwater-iraq-killings-highlight-lack.php">accused in the deaths of 17 Iraqi civilians</a> [JURIST report] in 2007. That month, the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] also <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/blackwater-under-investigation-for.php">opened an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether Blackwater bribed the Iraqi government to be permitted to continue operating in Iraq following the 2007 shootings. Blackwater <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/blackwater-security-firm-ends-baghdad.php">ceased operations in Baghdad</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 when its security contracts expired and were not renewed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jackson</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Brief-01-18-11-111629.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], declining to determine whether a state court erred in certifying a class of smokers who sued four tobacco companies, claiming that cigarettes containing nicotine are defective products. Despite the fact that the Louisiana state court found that cigarettes containing nicotine are not defective products, the smokers, potentially hundreds of thousands, were awarded a 10-year court-administered smoking cessation program, the implementation of which has been delayed because of the appeal process. Justice Antonin Scalia <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/10A273.pdf">stayed the verdict</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/scalia-stays-louisiana-class-action-ruling-against-tobacco-companies.php">report</a>] last September. Following the issuance of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-277.pdf">Wal-Mart v. Dukes</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rejects-class-action-lawsuit-against-wal-mart.php">report</a>] last week, the petitioners argued in their <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/PM-supp-brief-6-21-11.pdf">supplemental reply brief</a> [text, PDF] that the court should take the opportunity to clarify the constitutional limits of class litigation in state courts and grant their petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em>. The respondents  <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/reply-to-PM-supp-brief-6-21-11.pdf">argued</a> [supplemental reply brief, PDF] that the court's decision in <span class="casename">Wal-Mart v. Dukes</span> is not analogous because that case was brought in federal court and involves federal procedural laws. 

<p>The court also denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1303.htm">Heydt-Benjamin v. Heydt-Benjamin</a> [docket], thereby declining to clarify the test for determining a child's country of habitual residence for purposes of the <a href="http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=24">Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</a> [text]. The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] summarily <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/d233f9b4-e70b-4361-9bf5-35aba205e4c6/1/doc/10-1780_so.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov:80/isysquery/d233f9b4-e70b-4361-9bf5-35aba205e4c6/1">ordered</a> [text, PDF] that the petitioner's two children remain in the US with their father instead of returning to Switzerland pursuant to the second circuit's interpretation of the international child abduction law. Some courts look at the "shared intent of the parents," while others determine whether the child has acclimatized to the new environment such that the new location constitutes the child's habitual residence. In her <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Petition-Final.pdf">petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [text, PDF], the mother argued that, because the circuit courts disagree on which test to apply, the court should grant <em>certiorari</em> to declare one uniform test. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court also turned down an appeal in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-1313.htm">Saleh v. Titan Corp.</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Pet.09-1313.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF ]. Plaintiff Iraqi nationals brought suits against two private US military contractors that provided services to the US government at the Abu Ghraib military prison during the war in Iraq. The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> affirmed a district court judgment holding that claims for torture and other war crimes cannot be brought against private actors under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute</a> [28 USC &#167; 1350] and creating a "battle-field preemption" doctrine that extends sovereign immunity to contractors. The appeals court indicated that judicial restraint is required particularly in cases "where foreign policy prerogatives of our executive and legislative branches" are at issue.</p>

<p>Finally, Justice Antonin Scalia <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-8373.pdf">dissented</a> [text, PDF] from denial of <em>certiorari</em> in four criminal cases, collectively <span class="casename">Derby v. US</span>, involving the residual clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00000924----000-.html">Armed Career Criminal Act</a> (ACCA) [18 USC &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) text]. Scalia wrote that the rule the court has announced for applying that clause is unclear. He expressed dissatisfaction that his colleagues failed to grant <em>certiorari</em> in those cases in order to declare the ACCA's residual clause unconstitutionally vague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-8505.htm">Williams v. Illinois</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Sandy-Williams-Cert.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will decide whether a state rule of evidence violates the Confrontation Clause when it permits an expert witness to testify about the results of a DNA test performed at a private laboratory, when the analysts who performed the tests do not testify, and the expert witness has not had an opportunity to confront the actual analysts. Sandy Williams was convicted of sexual assault. At trial, an expert for the prosecution testified that the DNA test results of samples from the sexual assault kit, conducted by a private company, matched the profile for Williams contained in the police crimes database. The test results were not actually entered into evidence, but the results were presented through the testimony of the expert witness, over Williams' objections. On appeal, the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/">Illinois Supreme Court</a> [official website] upheld the rule because the DNA test results were not being offered for the truth of the the tests, but for the non-hearsay purpose of providing a background for the expert witness's conclusions. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-10876">Bullcoming v. New Mexico</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules-in-confrontation-clause-case.php">report</a>] that the Confrontation Clause does not allow laboratory reports to be entered into evidence against a defendant without the testimony of the analyst who personally observed the test and certified the report.

<p>The Supreme Court will also hear <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1062.htm">Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Sacket-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] in which petitioners are challenging whether the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] can enforce a compliance order issued without any opportunity to contest the order. The Sacketts own land near Priest Lake, Idaho on which they intended to build a house. After purchasing the property and obtaining local permits, they began to grade the land for construction of a house. They received an EPA Administrative Compliance Order that said the grading of the land was in violation of the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [text, PDF] and imposed harsh civil penalties for non-compliance. The Sacketts disagree that their property is a wetland under the meaning of the CWA. The case raises the issue of whether the CWA precludes pre-enforcement judicial review, and if so, whether that violates the petitioner's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/17/08-35854.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the dismissal of the suit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Texas <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=821&Bill=HB41">HB 41</a> [materials] while the <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/">Senate</a> [official website] simultaneously passed <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=821&Bill=SB29">SB 29</a> [materials], both seeking to reduce "groping" during airport security screening processes. A person acting in violation of the law could be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/28/us-airport-security-texas-idUSTRE75R03N20110628">charged with a Class A misdemeanor</a> [Reuters report], which is punishable by up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. The bill, however, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/28/texas-tsa-bill-pat-downs_n_885905.html">gives security officials a defense</a> [Huffington Post report] to prosecution if the officials act with "reasonable suspicion" that the search is necessary, a less rigid standard than the "probable cause" standard in the original version of the bill. Texas House Speaker Joe Straus <a href="http://www.house.state.tx.us/news/press-releases/?id=3758&session=82&year=2011&district=121&bill_code=4565">expressed his approval</a> [press release] of the bill's passage, which "lets Texans travel safely, protects the privacy of citizens, and enables law enforcement do its job." US Attorney for the Western District of Texas <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/txw/offices/san_antonio.html">John Murphy</a> [official website] warned Texas lawmakers that the bill would be challenged because it impinges on the duties of the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">Transportation Security Administration</a> (TSA) [official website], a federal agency enlisted to ensure traveler safety. Following revisions, a final vote from the House is required before the bill makes its way to <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a>. 

<p>The TSA <a href="http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2011/06/tsa-changes-policy-on-child-pat-downs-/175407/1?csp=34travel&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TP-TodayInTheSky+%28Travel+-+Today+In+the+Sky%29">announced a policy change</a> [USA Today report] in June that seeks to reduce the number of invasive pat-downs of children under age 12. Perry <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/16323/">commended the TSA</a> [press release] for making the change, indicating that "Texas will continue seeking more common-sense approaches to TSA security measures." The TSA has faced criticism for other tight security measures. In April 2010, a group of more than 30 privacy and civil liberty groups <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/airtravel/backscatter/petition_042110.pdf">asked</a> [petition, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/civil-rights-groups-seek-suspension-of.php">report</a>] the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] to suspend the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/approach/tech/imaging_technology.shtm">full body scanner</a> [TSA backgrounder] program being implemented by the TSA. The body scanners were introduced in part as a response to the failed US bombing attempt by <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6896128/Detroit-terror-attack-profile-of-Umar-Farouk-Abdul-Mutallab.html">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a> [<i>Telegraph</i> profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=abdulmutallab">news archive</a>] on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day. The attempted attack prompted Obama to <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/obama-announces-enhanced-air-security.php">announce tighter security measures</a>, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/rights-groups-claim-enhanced-airline.php">civil rights groups opposed</a> [JURIST reports] as a pretext to racial profiling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The "Woman's Right to Know Act" would also have required women seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound of the fetus prior to the procedure. Supporters argued that the bill was necessary in order for women to be fully informed about their decision, but Perdue disagreed, calling it "a dangerous intrusion into the confidential relationship that exists between women and their doctors." Vetoing the legislation, Perdue issued the following statement:<blockquote>The bill contains provisions that are the most extreme in the nation in terms of interfering with that relationship. Physicians must be free to advise and treat their patients based on their medical knowledge and expertise and not have their advice overridden by elected officials seeking to impose their own ideological agenda on others.</blockquote>The legislation passed the House 71-48 and the Senate 29-20. Republican leaders have indicated that they may try to obtain the three-fifths majority necessary to <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2011/06/27/2410649/abortion-bill-awaiting-decision.html#storylink=misearch">override the governor's veto</a> [<em>Charlotte Observer</em> report].

<p>Several other state legislatures have acted recently to limit abortion rights. Both <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/florida-govenor-signs-bill-restricting-access-to-abortions.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] have recently passed bills requiring ultrasounds before abortions. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">lawsuit challenging the Texas law</a> [JURIST report]. In March, South Dakota passed a law requiring a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">three-day waiting period</a> [JURIST report] before an abortion&#8212;the longest waiting period in the country. That law is also facing a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">court challenge</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moreno-Ocampo called on the aides to arrest <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099321.pdf">Gaddafi</a>, his son <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099329.pdf">Saif al-Islam Gaddafi</a>, the "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister," and his brother-in-law <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1099332.pdf">Abdullah al-Sanussi</a> [warrants, PDF], the head of intelligence, for alleged crimes against the people of Libya to quell the revolt that began last February, saying the aides could be "part of the solution." Though Libya is not a signatory of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] granting the ICC its jurisdiction, Moreno-Ocampo said, "Libya has to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1970, which specifically called on Libya to "cooperate fully with and provide any necessary assistance to the Court and the Prosecutor.'" Libya has <a href="http://www.pakistantimes.net/pt/detail.php?newsId=22842">rejected the warrants</a> [<em>Pakistan Times</em> report], claiming the ICC is a vehicle for European foreign policy. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/27/gaddafi-arrest-warrant-celebrations-libya">Libyan citizens celebrated</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the ICC's announcement that it had issued the arrest warrants.

<p>Last week, Moreno-Ocampo presented the arrest warrants' supporting materials to Pre-Trial Chamber. He said his office had <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icc-to-decide-whether-to-issue-gaddafi-arrest-warrant.php">gathered "direct evidence"</a> [JURIST report] that shows Gaddafi personally ordered attacks on civilian protestors and that his forces used live ammunition on crowds, attacked civilians in their homes, used heavy weapons against people in funeral processions and placed snipers to shoot those leaving mosques after prayer services. Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-prosecutor-seeks-gaddafi-arrest-warrant-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] last month that his office was pursuing arrest warrants against Gaddafi and the two others in his "inner circle." He said Saif al-Islam was acting as Gaddafi's "<em>de facto</em> Prime Minister" and called al-Sanussi Gaddafi's "right-hand man" and "executioner." At that time, Moreno-Ocampo said his office was almost prepared for trial, having collected quality testimony from some who have fled Libya. There have been numerous allegations of war crimes and human rights violations over the Libyan revolt which has persisted since February. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-extends-mandate-for-investigation-of-libya-abuses.php">extend a mandate to an investigative panel</a> instructing it to continue its investigation of human rights abuses in Libya, after it <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-commission-on-libya-says-government-forces-have-committed-war-crimes.php">published a 92-page report</a> [JURIST reports]. The report claims Libyan authorities have committed crimes against humanity such as acts constituting murder, imprisonment and other severe deprivations of physical liberties, torture, forced disappearances and rape "as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population with knowledge of the attack."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Koh testified that Obama's conduct is consistent with the Constitution, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/usc_sup_01_50_10_33.html">1973 War Powers Resolution</a> [50 USC &#167; 1541 <em>et seq.</em>] and international law. Specifically, Koh provided four factors suggesting the current situation in Libya does not amount to a "hostility" requiring Congressional authorization or automatic withdrawal after 60 days pursuant to the War Powers Resolution. First, the mission is limited in that US forces are merely providing support in the civilian protection operation, even though <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">NATO</a> [official website] forces are engaging in more aggressive military conduct in Libya. Second, US presence in Libya has not resulted in significant US casualties, indicating that the confrontations are not hostile. The operation appears to lack the risk of escalation, as prolonged combat is unlikely and geographical scope is narrow. Finally, Koh pointed out that US presence in Libya is far from "full military engagement." Koh asked the committee to approve a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.J.RES.20:">bipartisan resolution</a> [SJ RES 20] to provide express Congressional authorization for continued operations in Libya.

<p>The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] in two votes last week <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/house-votes-down-authorization-for-libya-but-continues-to-fund-it.php">sent contradictory messages</a> [JURIST report] over authorization of US military operations in Libya, <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll493.xml">voting down 123-295</a> [roll call vote] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.J.RES.68:">resolution</a> [HJ RES 68] that would have authorized further operations in Libya, and later <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll494.xml">voting down 180-238</a> [roll call vote] a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.2278:">measure</a> [HR 2278] that would have defunded the operations, save for rescue and intelligence efforts to assist NATO. Obama disagrees with certain members of Congress regarding his legal authority to continue military operations in Libya. Obama's position is that he is <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-releases-report-justifying-actions-and-cost-in-libya.php">not in violation</a> [JURIST report] of the War Powers Resolution. His office maintains that US activities in Libya do not amount to "hostilities" because the US is only playing a supporting role in the NATO-led mission pursuant to and limited by the UN Security Council Resolution authorizing military action in Libya to protect civilians. But earlier this week, it was reported that Obama came to this conclusion <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-lawyers-divided-over-legality-of-us-operations-in-libya.php">overriding the legal interpretations</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel</a> [official websites]. <a href="http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/main.asp?PID=34">Jordan Paust</a> [academic profile] of the University of Houston Law Center <a href="/forum/2011/05/jordan-paust-libya-war-powers.php">has argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that Obama is not violating the War Powers Resolution because the resolution was meant to limit only his authority as Commander-In-Chief. In this case, Obama is acting pursuant to his Executive authority under <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">Article II</a> [text]. Paust argues: "given the fact that treaties of the United States (such as the UN Charter) are supreme federal laws, it is evident that the President has constitutionally-based authority to faithfully execute US competencies under the Charter outside of the President's independent authority as Commander-in-Chief."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The securities, called first-lien residential mortgage-backed securitization, were issued by the BOA unit Countrywide Financial Corporation, which it <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/bank-of-america-to-pay-85-billion-settlement-over-mortgages/2011/06/29/AGPPnTqH_story.html">purchased</a> [AP report] for $4 billion in 2008. The settlement is only a small portion of the original principal balance of $424 billion covering 530 trusts with The Bank of New York Mellon as trustee. The settlement also includes an additional $5.5 billion in mortgage-related charges and BOA said it will also end up paying $2.6 billion in goodwill expenses. Shares of BOA jumped Wednesday morning before the market opened as investors were more confident that BOA's looming liability was being settled. Still, a court must approve the settlement. 

<p>BOA has recently been the target of several lawsuits over its business practices. BOA was dismissed in April from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/investors-sue-bank-of-america-subsidiary-for-fraud.php">lawsuit filed against Countrywide Financial</a> [JURIST reports] last January, The plaintiffs argued that they had invested hundreds of millions of dollars between 2005 and 2007 believing the purchases of mortgage-backed securities to be "conservative, low-risk investments." The suit claims that Countrywide "recklessly" misrepresented the stability of the investments and failed to adhere to its stated underwriting and credit analysis procedures, leading the credit ratings of many of the securities to fall significantly. Last month, a federal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/bank-of-america-gains-preliminary-approval-of-class-action-settlement-for-illegal-overdraft-fees.php">preliminarily approved</a> [JURIST report] a class action settlement for $410 million between BOA and customers claiming they were illegally charged overdraft fees. BOA is among more than two dozen US, Canadian and European lenders named as defendants in the class action lawsuit, which consolidated claims across the country in 2009. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/case/hodes-nauser-mds-pa-et-al-v-robert-moser-md-et-al">suit</a> [case backgrounder], filed on behalf of two doctors, alleges that regulations issued by the <a href="http://www.kdheks.gov/health/">Kansas Department of Health</a> [official website] were intended to shut down the only abortion providers in the state. According to the plaintiffs, the department of health issued the new regulations without giving proper notice or opportunity to be heard, imposing review and compliance deadlines in mid-June for the regulation which is set to take effect on July 1. The regulations would also force the providers to rebuild their offices to comply with the new, stringent standards. Nancy Northup, president of the CRR, condemned the Kansas regulations:<blockquote>Between the rigid and unnecessary building standards and the absurd deadlines, this licensing process is a complete sham. Our clients have a long record of providing safe and high-quality OB/GYN care, including abortion services, to women over the last thirty years. These regulations have nothing to do with safety standards, and everything to do with an aggressive anti-choice government trying to shut down abortion providers.</blockquote>The plaintiffs are challenging the regulations on due process grounds and further assert that the laws create an undue burden on patients seeking abortions.

<p>The CRR filed a <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/TX%20Complaint%20FIN.pdf">challenge</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">report</a>] earlier this month to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">newly signed</a> Texas law requiring a sonogram be done before a woman can have an abortion. The CRR filed the lawsuit on behalf of a class of physicians who perform abortions claiming that the act is unconstitutional because it "profoundly intrudes on the practice of medicine, forces physicians to deliver ideological speech to patients, and treats women as less than fully competent adults." Also this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">Iowa House passed</a> [JURIST report] what would be the most restrictive law yet, effectively banning abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ohio</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

As the Ivory Coast is not a member state of the ICC because it is not a signatory of the <a href = "http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/0D8024D3-87EA-4E6A-8A27-05B987C38689/0/RomeStatuteEng.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF], the ICC can only investigate with the Ivory Coast's express permission.

This followed a request by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile] for the <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/cote-divoire-president-asks-icc-to-launch-probe-into-crimes-after-disputed-november-election.php">ICC to launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report]. Despite Ouattara requesting the investigation, the ICC will be investigating <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-28/icc-investigating-ivory-coast-violence-on-both-sides-correct-.html">both sides of the election violence</a> [Bloomberg report], including violence fomented by Ouattara's administration.

<p>The Ivory Coast announced earlier this month it would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-initiates-investigation-into-post-election-violence.php">establish its own commission</a> [JURIST report] to investigate alleged crimes committed as a result of the disputed presidential elections. This investigation may take <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE75L02M20110622">up to two years</a> [Reuters report]. Also, an official for the UN's International Commission of Inquiry <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-calls-for-investigation-of-ivory-coast-president.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Ouattara and his forces' continuing attacks against supporters of ousted leader <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] earlier this month.

According to the report, the pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of the Ivory Coast, killed more than 100 civilians, raped at least 20 supporters of Gbagbo and burned at least 10 villages in March. Also in April, the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/eng/index.jsp">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] reported the deaths of <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/icrc-hundreds-killed-in-ivory-coast-massacre.php">at least 800 civilians</a> [JURIST report] in the Ivory Coast town of Duekoue as a result of intercommunal violence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsame-sex.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Gay rights groups <a href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> and <a href = "http://www.gardenstateequality.org/">Garden State Equality</a> [advocacy websites] filed a <A href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/gse_nj_20110629_complaint-for-declaratory-and-injunctive-relief.html">lawsuit</a> [complaint text, PDF; <a href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/garden-state-equality-v-dow.html">case materials</a>] on Wednesday to force the state of New Jersey to recognize and legalize same-sex marriage as opposed to its current <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2006/Bills/A4000/3787_I1.PDF">Civil Unions Law</a> [text, PDF]. The suit was filed in the Mercer County Superior Court of New Jersey on behalf of <a href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/nj_20110629_garden-state-equality.html">eight same-sex couples</a> [press release] who have had civil unions and are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief due to continued discrimination.<blockquote>Today, New Jersey shunts lesbian and gay couples into the novel and inferior status of "civil unions," while reserving civil marriage only for heterosexual couples. As the Plaintiff's experience shows, the relegation of lesbian and gay couples to civil unions, and their exclusion from civil marriage, and thereby from the legal status of "marriage" and "spouse," violates the guarantee of equal protection under Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution of 1947. Specifically, the separate and inherently unequal statutory scheme singles out lesbian and gay men for inferior treatment on the basis of their sexual orientation and sex, and also has a profoundly stigmatizing effect on them, their children, and on other lesbian and gay men New Jerseyans. As the Supreme Court of New Jersey made clear, the equal protection guarantee forbids "the unequal dispensation of rights and benefits to committed same-sex partners." This exclusion also violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>Lamda Legal filed a <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/new-jersey-high-court-declines-to-hear-same-sex-marriage-case.php">similar suit last year</a> [JURIST report], but the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/index.htm">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> [official website] declined to hear the case, holding that it must first be heard in the lower courts. In 2009, a superior court judged <a href = "http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/02/new-jersey-judge-grants-divorce-to-same.php">allowed a divorce to proceed between a same-sex couple</A> [JURIST report], but cautioned that this would not extend to legalizing same-sex marriage in New Jersey through the courts.

<p>Earlier this week, New Jersey <a href = "http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] reiterated that he will <a href = "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-26/new-jersey-s-christie-says-he-s-not-a-fan-of-gay-marriage.html">not sign a gay marriage bill into law</a> [Bloomberg report]. Christie was questioned on his reaction to New York <a href="http://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> (D) [official website] signing <a href="http://open.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/A8354-2011">legislation</a> [A8354-2011 materials] <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">allowing same-sex couples to marry</a> [JURIST report]. With the legislation, New York becomes the seventh US jurisdiction to allow same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is also legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports]. Civil unions or domestic partnerships are currently legal in Maine, <A href = "/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">Illinois</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">Delaware</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-governor-signs-same-sex-unions-bill-into-law.php">Hawaii</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2005/04/court-upholds-california-gay.php">California</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-judge-upholds-domestic-partnership-registry.php">Wisconsin</a>, <A href = "/paperchase/2009/06/nevada-legislature-passes-same-sex.php">Nevada</a>, <A href = "/paperchase/2008/02/federal-judge-lifts-stay-on-oregon.php">Oregon</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">Washington</a> and await ratification in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/rhode-island-house-approves-civil-union-bill.php">Rhode Island</a> [JURIST reports].<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontantiabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.house.state.oh.us/">Ohio House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 54-43 on Tuesday to approve <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=129_HB_125">legislation</a> [HB 125] that would prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable, which could occur as early as six weeks into the pregnancy. The "heartbeat bill" <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/28/us-abortion-ohio-heartbeat-idUSTRE75R7NC20110628">provides no exceptions</a> [Reuters report] for rape, incest or the life or health of the mother. The law effectively challenges the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html">Roe v. Wade</a> [opinion] which upheld a woman's right to an abortion until the fetus is "viable," usually at 22-24 weeks. <a href="http://www.ohiolife.org/">Ohio Right to Life</a> (ORTL) [advocacy website] does not support any effort to pass the bill, saying that the law would likely be deemed unconstitutional and facing a federal lawsuit would be costly to taxpayers. Marshall Pitchford, Chairman of the ORTL Board of Trustees, <a href="http://www.ohiolife.org/storage/Affiliated%20Chapter%20Letter.pdf">expressed his concerns</a> [statement, PDF] with the bill:<blockquote>As excitement and support continues to build for our legislative agenda, we are reminded of our responsibility as the Ohio Right to Life Society, the state's largest and longest serving pro life organization, to advise our elected officials of other initiatives that come before them which will have negative effects and unintended consequences. H.B. 125, the so-called "Heartbeat Bill" is one such measure which will do just that.</blockquote> The House passed two other abortion-related bills on Tuesday. <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=129_HB_78">HB 78</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ohio-senate-approves-bill-limiting-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">already passed</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.ohiosenate.gov/">Ohio Senate</a> [official website], bans late-term abortions after 20 weeks if a doctor determines that the fetus is viable outside the womb. <a href="http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=129_HB_79">HB 79</a> [text] prohibits qualified health plans from providing coverage for non-therapeutic abortions. 

<p>Ohio is one of many states to introduce more restrictive abortion regulations in recent months. The <a href="http://www.legis.iowa.gov/index.aspx">Iowa House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted in June in favor of a <a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/linc/84/external/H1736_Introduced.pdf">bill</a> [HF-1736 text, PDF] that would effectively <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/iowa-house-passes-18-week-abortion-ban.php">ban abortions after 18 weeks of pregnancy</a> {JURIST report], making it the most restrictive abortion law in the country. Last month, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/index.htm">Planned Parenthood</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/south-dakota-abortion-waiting-period-challenged.php">lawsuit</a> challenging a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">South Dakota law</a> [JURIST reports] requiring women to seek counseling at a pregnancy center and wait three days before obtaining an abortion. Earlier that week, Minnesota <a href="http://markdayton.org/">Governor Mark Dayton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-governor-vetoes-bills-restricting-abortion-rights.php">vetoed a pair of bills</a> [JURIST report] that restricted state funding for abortions and banned them altogether after 20 weeks. Also in May, Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] signed into law a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to first get a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">sonogram</a> [JURIST report]. Multiple states have acted to ban abortions after 20 weeks, when some studies suggest a fetus can begin feeling pain, including <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/missouri-lawmakers-approve-late-term-abortion-ban.php">Missouri</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-approves-legislation-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Indiana</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Alabama</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/oklahoma-house-approves-bill-banning-abortion-after-20-weeks.php">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/kansas-house-approves-new-abortion-restrictions.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/idaho-legislature-passes-anti-abortion-bill.php">Idaho</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The state is challenging a decision in the <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] by Judge Tanya Walton Pratt that prevents application of the portion of the law that bans contracts between state agencies and any entity that performs <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=abortion">abortions</a> [JURIST news archive] or maintains a facility where abortions are performed. The appeal seeks to determine whether the preliminary injunction may continue before the case proceeds. PPIN and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed the challenge seeking a permanent injunction of the law. Zoeller <a href="http://www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/2369.htm">noted</a> [press release] that the state is already appealing the administrative decision made earlier this month by Donald Berwick, administrator of the <a href="http://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services</a> (CMMS) [official website], to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/obama-administration-indiana-ban-on-funds-for-abortion-services-violates-federal-law.php">deny approval of the law</a> [JURIST report]. He sent a letter to the Indiana state agency saying states have the ability to assign the qualified provider status, but the law violates <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1902.htm">&#167; 1902(a)(23) of the Social Security Act</a> [text] because it prevents Medicaid beneficiaries from receiving services from certain providers for reasons unrelated to the providers qualifications to provide those services. 

<p>The Obama administration has taken a stance against the Indiana law. In addition to the CMMS denial, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] filed a brief <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-indiana-ban-on-medicaid-funds-to-abortion-providers-violates-federal-law.php">urging the court to grant an injunction</a> [JURIST report] to stop the enforcement of the law. The ban includes disbursement of grant money, including federal Medicare funds, a provision PPIN claims is not legal under the federal Medicaid Act's "freedom of choice" provision, which allows states to disallow Medicare funding for medical providers based on deficiencies in quality of service. Before granting the preliminary injunction, the judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-refuses-to-block-indiana-planned-parenthood-cuts.php">denied a request for a restraining order</a> [JURIST report] to block implementation of the law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Though the ICTR has never referred a case to a Rwanda court, the Referral Chamber determined that Rwanda was capable of accepting and prosecuting Uwinkindi's case:<blockquote>Rwanda had made material changes in its laws and had indicated its capacity and willingness to prosecute cases referred by the ICTR adhering to internationally recognised fair trial standards enshrined in the ICTR Statute and other human rights instruments.  In particular, the Chamber found that the issues which concerned previous Referral Chambers, namely the availability of witnesses and their protection, had been addressed to some degree in the intervening period.</blockquote>As a precuationary measure, the Referral Chamber requested that the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/news_en.html">African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights</a> (ACHPR) [official website] be appointed to oversee the trial and present any issues to the ICTR President as they arise. Uwinkindi <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/155/Default.aspx?id=1152">pleaded not guilty</a> [press release] in July 2010 to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity relating to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>]. Uwinkindi was <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/Court%20Documents/ICTR/Uwinkindi_Indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] by the ICTR in 2001 and has been charged with genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity. The indictment alleges that Uwinkindi collaborated with the extremist National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND) party in order to kill Tutsis. He allegedly led a group of Hutus to look for and kill a group of Tutsi settlers and conspired with members of the militia to kill Tutsis who sought protection in the church where he was the pastor. According to the indictment, approximately 2,000 bodies were found near the church where the violence occurred. Uwinkindi had been one of the ICTR's most wanted suspects, with a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/10486173.stm">$5 million reward being offered</a> [BBC report] for information leading to his capture. He was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-uganda.php">apprehended</a> [JURIST report] by Ugandan authorities and transferred to the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania.

<p>Former Chief Prosecutor of the ICTR <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hassan+jallow">Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/155/Default.aspx?id=1174">filed new applications</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ictr-prosecutor-refers-3-cases-to-rwanda-for-trial.php">report</a>] in November 2010 for the referral of three cases for trial in Rwanda, including those of Uwinkindi, <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=65&amp;mnid=12">Fulgence Kayishema</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/ictr-seeks-return-of-genocide-case-to.php">report</a>] and <a  href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=74&amp;mnid=12">Charles Sikubwabo</a> [case materials]. In September 2010, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/ictr-transfers-25-cases-to-rwandan-jurisdiction.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] the cases of 25 suspects to Rwandan authorities. The suspects, who have been investigated but not yet indicted by the ICTR, are believed to be in hiding abroad. The transfers are a part of the strategy intended to <a href="http://liveunictr.altmansolutions.com/Portals/0/English/FactSheets/Completion_St/S-2009-587e.pdf">finish</a> [completion strategy text, PDF] the court's trial work by 2011. Rwandan Prosecutor General Martin Ngoga told the UN Security Council last year that the decisions by the ICTR not to transfer pending cases to Rwandan jurisdiction, including genocide suspects <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=2&amp;mnid=2">Jean-Baptiste Gatete</a> and <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=6&amp;mnid=2">Yussuf Munyakazi</a> [case materials] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/rwanda-prosecutor-criticizes-ictr.php">undermines judicial reforms</a> [JURIST report] and hinders national reconciliation. JURIST Guest Columnist and former Managing Editor Ingrid Burke, who has personal experience at the ICTR, argues that <a href="/dateline/2010/06/tanzania-transferring-cases-from-the-ictr-to-rwanda-courts.php">some cases ought to be referred to Rwandan courts</a> [JURIST op-ed], suggesting that doing so "is in the best interest of both the Rwandan judiciary's stability and the benefit of international criminal law in the future."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Those seven were charged with shutting down a government organization. Six others were given fines and between three and four-month sentences for blocking roads and assaulting government employees. An <a href = "http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE75S3YD20110629">additional 55</a> [Reuters Africa] were sentenced for vandalism the day before. The indicted were arrested after <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011227112850852905.html">protests in February</a> [Al-Jazeera report] where at least two were killed.

<p>The protests in Sohar were prompted by the recent wave of protests in the Middle East.

During a televised <a href="http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/462967">speech</a> [transcript], Khalifa indicated that he had ordered a committee under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister to look into abuses that took place in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/790690.stm">Bahrain</a> [BBC profile] earlier this year. Khalifa said that the country had already begun to move forward from the violence, but maintained that the commission would seek to uncover who should be held responsible:<blockquote>[W]e also need to look back and to determine exactly what happened in February and March, and to consider the reactions to those events. There were victims of the violence that took place. They must not be forgotten. There have been accusations and counter-accusations about the origins of the violence. A lack of confidence has prevailed, and disagreements have led to conflicting beliefs about events, even if such beliefs are founded only on rumors.</blockquote>The commission, Khalifa said, would be composed of international human rights law experts recommended by the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] and other international human rights organizations. 

<p>Earlier this month, the OHCHR <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38641&amp;Cr=bahrain&amp;Cr1=">announced</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/bahrain-agrees-to-un-rights-office-investigation-of-protest-violations.php">report</a>] that Bahrain has agreed to permit a UN commission to investigate human rights violations related to protests. In April, human rights organizations including <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (DWB) [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/human-rights-organizations-criticize-rampant-abuses-in-bahrain.php">criticized Bahrain  for rampant human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] related to anti-government protests. Six <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-opposition-leaders-held-amidst-violent-crackdown-on-protesters.php">opposition leaders were arrested</a> [JURIST report] in March after the government, backed by foreign troops from the <a href="http://www.gcc-sg.org/eng/">Gulf Cooperation Council</a> (GCC) [official website], violently dispersed protesters in the capital of Manana. Days earlier, Khalifa <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-king-declares-3-month-state-of-emergency-amid-widespread-protests.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://bna.bh/portal/news/449947">three-month state of emergency</a> [decree text, in Arabic] in response to growing unrest in the island nation. The state of emergency came just days after a group of 22 Bahraini lawmakers, part of an independent pro-government bloc, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/bahrain-lawmakers-call-for-state-of-emergency.php">called on the King to impose martial law</a> [JURIST report] under articles 36 and 123 of the <a href="http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Bahrain.pdf">Bahraini Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. In February, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] called for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-sg-calls-for-an-end-to-violence-against-middle-east-protesters.php">end to violence against protesters</a> [JURIST report] in the country, referencing attempts to quell protests sweeping across the region.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.thomasmore.org/default-sb_thomasmore.html?682648548">Thomas More Law Center</a> (TMLC) [advocacy website], joined by four individuals, challenged the individual mandate provision of PPACA, arguing that it unconstitutionally compels the purchase of health insurance. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that Congress lacks authority under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to pass such a provision or, in the alternative, that the penalty for not purchasing insurance is an unconstitutional tax. Initially, the court determined that the penalty is not a tax for purposes of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26.html">Internal Revenue Code</a> [text]. The Court went on to state that the health care market "is large and is inextricably linked to interstate commerce" and that those who choose to not purchase health insurance substantially affect interstate commerce through cost-shifting that drives up insurance premiums. As a result, the Court determined that Congress did not violate the Commerce Clause, finding it had a rational basis for the individual mandate because "the provision regulates active participation in the health care market, and in any case, the Constitution imposes no categorical bar on regulating inactivity." The <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], which argued on behalf of the government, issued a <a href="http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1435">statement</a> [text] welcoming the ruling and pledging that the DOJ will continue to defend PPACA. The statement went on to compare PPACA to legislative challenges that failed in the past, such as the Social Security Act and Civil Rights Act and finally stated, "[w]e believe these challenges to health reform will also fail." The TMLC <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2011/06/30/obama_reaps_victory_as_judges_uphold_health_law/">plans to appeal</a> [AP report] to the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website].

<p>Similar cases regarding the constitutionality of PPACA are being heard in federal courts across the nation. Last week, a three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/third-circuit-hears-arguments-in-health-care-law-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/eleventh-circuit-hears-arguments-on-constitutionality-of-new-health-care-law.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding the constitutionality of the individual mandate. The appeal was brought by the DOJ after the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] struck down the entire health care law after it determined that the individual mandate <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-finds-health-care-reform-act-unconstitutional.php">exceeds Congress' authority</a> [JURIST report] under the Commerce Clause. Also this month, the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] decided it can rule on two challenges to PPACA after the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/fourth-circuit-questions-authority-to-hear-health-care-law-challenge.php">requested briefs</a> [JURIST report] from all parties on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> (AIA) [text], which prevents injunctions against taxes before the tax is imposed, would bar review of PPACA until it is implemented. The Fourth Circuit already <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-hears-arguments-in-health-care-reform-challenge.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in May to resolve a split decision between the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-rules-health-insurance-mandate-unconstitutional.php">ruling against the individual mandate</a> and the Western District of Virginia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-health-care-lawsuit.php">dismissing a challenge</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report, entitled "Against the Law: Crackdown on China's Human Rights Lawyers Deepens,"  presents evidence that human rights lawyers have increasingly had their licenses revoked or suspended and have faced harassment and torture in some cases. The government has reportedly targeted lawyers who take on land rights conflicts and freedom of religion and expression issues. Chinese lawyers and law firms undergo "annual assessments" which, the government claims, are conducted by independent lawyers associations. AI contends, however, that the lawyers defending human rights disproportionately fail the assessment and expressed general concern with the treatment of human rights lawyers in China:<blockquote>Amnesty International is gravely concerned about the developments described in this report. These show that the Chinese authorities are not only failing to ensure protection for human rights lawyers and others seeking to provide legal services, but are actively undermining their work through legislative, administrative, and practical measures. If lawyers and legal workers are rendered incapable of challenging human rights violations committed by those acting in an official capacity, there can be no effective protection of human rights in China.</blockquote>The report included recommendations for the Chinese government, including calls to end the harassment and persecution of lawyers, recognize that lawyers are independent of the state, abolish the annual assessment and review current domestic legislation in order to "eliminate the obstructions they impose on the work of lawyers in order to fully implement international standards on the role of lawyers."

<p>The 2011 report is an update to AI's <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/042/2009/en/4e47d88a-c9d4-4e42-8b37-0a59cda0752a/asa170422009eng.pdf">2009 report</a> [text, PDF] also evaluating China's rule of law and the treatment of legal professionals. China has had a well-known struggle with international criticism of its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=China+Human+Rights">human rights record</a> [JURIST news archive]. In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] declared in a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/95361/section/1">report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/china-fails-to-deliver-on-human-rights-promises-hrw.php">report</a>] that China has failed to achieve the goals it set out in its first national human rights plan. In May 2010, two Chinese human rights lawyers who have represented <a href="http://www.falundafa.org/">Falun Gong</a> [group website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/401268.stm">backgrounder</a>] defendants were <a href="http://www.bjsf.gov.cn/sy/sytztg/201005/t20100507_1279393.html">permanently disbarred</a> [Tang decision, <a href="http://www.bjsf.gov.cn/sy/cxjl/cxjllsgl/201005/t20100507_1279438.html">Liu decision</a>, in Chinese; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/China-disbars-rights-lawyers .php">report</a>] after being accused of disrupting courtrooms. AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/chinese-human-rights-defenders-subjected-absurd-disbarment-hearing-2010-04-22">criticized the disbarment hearing</a> [press release] calling it "absurd" and claiming that "[g]overnment authorities in China continue to harass and disrupt the work of lawyers taking politically sensitive cases." In April 2009, the <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/">Information Office of the State Council</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/china-issues-first-human-rights.php">published the National Human Rights Action Plan of China (NHRAP)</a> [JURIST report], which aimed to protect ethnic minorities, promote gender equality, guarantee suspects the right to an impartial trial, and prohibit illegal detentions and the use of torture to extract confessions from suspects. In February 2009, the Chinese delegation to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-defends-rights-record-in-review.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] China's human rights record while presenting a <a href="http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session4/CN/A_HRC_WG6_4_CHN_1_E.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] in compliance with the UNHRC's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [official website] process.

The Senate passed the bill 33-1 and then it passed the Assembly later in the day 58-11 with 8 abstentions. The bill now goes to New Jersey <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> (R) [official website] to sign or veto it. If Christie signs the bill into law, it will make New Jersey the first state to impose a complete statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing. He has not said yet whether he plans to sign. Still, the bill is largely symbolic since experts say New Jersey <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/AP4f609347926a4cad902401a53e1c7067.html">only sits over a small portion</a> [WSJ report] of shale gas, unlike its neighbors New York and Pennsylvania. Hydraulic fracturing is a process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the ground to create fractures in rocks which allows trapped gas and oil to come to surface. Environmental and health concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing include contamination of ground water, migration of gases and hydraulic fracturing chemicals to the surface and the potential mishandling of waste. 

<p>Fracking, has become a controversial issue as it is implemented in the US and around the world. Earlier this month, New York <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/about.html">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> [official profile] filed a lawsuit against the US government to compel several federal agencies to comply with <a href="http://www.epa.gov/Compliance/nepa/">National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA) [EPA materials] by investigating the environmental impact of fracking and making the findings available to the public prior to adopting a proposal by the <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/drbc/">Delaware River Basin Commission</a> (DRBC) [advocacy website] authorizing natural gas development in the region. In May, France's lower house, the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/index.asp">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French], approved a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/ta/ta0658.asp">bill</a> [TA Bill No. 658, <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/interdiction_exploration_exploitation_hydrocarbures_non_conventionnels.asp">materials</a>, in French; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/france-lower-house-approves-ban-on-shale-gas-tapping.php">report</a>] to prohibit the drilling of gas and oil through hydraulic fracturing and to repeal hydraulic fracturing licenses granted to companies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/BillText11/HouseText11/H6103Aaa.pdf">bill</a> [2011 - H6103, PDF] is identical to a version of the bill passed in the <a href="http://www.rilin.state.ri.us/house/">House of Representatives</a> [official website], and <a href="http://www.governor.ri.gov/">Governor Lincoln Chafee</a> [official website] is expected to sign the bill into law. Modeled after similar legislation in <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/illinois-governor-signs-civil-union-bill-into-law.php">Illinois</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/05/delaware-governor-signs-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">Delaware</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/hawaii-senate-approves-same-sex-unions-governor-to-sign-into-law-soon.php">Hawaii</a> [JURIST reports], the bill defines a civil union as "a legal union between two individuals of the same sex" and affords same-sex couples the same rights and benefits as married couples. The legislation also includes a provision that allows religiously affiliated institutions, such as schools and hospitals, to ignore the legal status of a same-sex union for any reason. The provision has drawn criticism from several gay advocacy groups including <a href="http://www.marriageequalityri.org/">Marriage Equality Rhode Island</a> (MERI), <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/">Freedom to Marry</a>, and the <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a> (GLAD) [advocacy websites]. Freedom to Marry and GLAD are two of many groups that signed a <a href="http://freedomtomarry.org/page/m/4d89389e/27177852/4fb8b85c/2e14d12f/1927854776/VEsH/">joint letter</a> [text] to the governor calling for a veto of the current bill: <blockquote>We greatly appreciate your strong support for the freedom to marry, and understand that you had previously expressed a willingness to sign a civil union bill as an incremental, if incomplete, step forward. The bill put forth by the legislature, however, would create onerous and discriminatory hurdles for same-sex couples that no other state has ever put in place.</blockquote> The groups also suggested that the provision allowing certain groups to completely disregard the validity civil unions would permit discrimination, particularly with respect to recognizing a person's legal rights.

<p>Governor Chafee, as well as advocacy groups, <a href = "http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wrni/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1795388/news/Civil.Union.bill.disappoints.Chafee">initially called</a> [NPR report] for the legalization of <A href = "/jurist_search.php?q=%22same-sex+marriage%22">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] but the House <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rhode-island-house-approves-civil-union-bill.php">did not approve the necessary amendment</a> [JURIST report]. Same-sex marriage continues to be a controversial and divisive issue throughout the US, although a recent <a href = "http://people-press.org/2011/03/03/fewer-are-angry-at-government-but-discontent-remains-high/">poll</a> [materials] suggests support for legalization is growing. New York recently became the nation's most populous state to<a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php"> pass a same-sex marriage bill</a> [JURIST report] while the <a href = "http://www.senate.leg.state.mn.us/">Minnesota Senate</a> [official website] in May <A href = "/paperchase/2011/05/minnesota-senate-approves-referendum-on-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">approved a voter referendum</a> [JURIST report] to amend the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In April, a Montana judge <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/montana-judge-dismisses-same-sex-marriage-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that had called for the state to provide legal status to same-sex relationships. Also in April, the <a href = "http://www.in.gov/legislative/index.htm">Indiana Senate</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-senate-approves-constitutional-ban-on-same-sex-marriage.php">overwhelmingly approved</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the state constitution that would ban same-sex marriage or any "substantially similar" status, and the <A href = "http://legisweb.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Senate</a> [official website] in February approved a bill that would <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/wyoming-senate-approves-bill-banning-same-sex-marriage-recognition.php">void in Wyoming any same-sex marriages and civil unions</a> [JURIST report] performed in other jurisdictions.

Boehner declined to defend DOMA in this case, deciding it was not worth the resources to overturn a bankruptcy decision. In an event for gay pride on Wednesday night, President Barack Obama reinforced that the DOJ was <a href = "http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2011/06/president-obama-ive-met-my-commitments-to-the-lgbt-community.html">not defending DOMA in court</a> [ABC News] and that he had fulfilled every promise he made to the LGBT community.

<p>Congressional Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">legislation</a> [text] in March to repeal DOMA after Obama pledged to no longer defend it, and Boehner said the House would independently defend the law. <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] acknowledged that the announcement marks a change in policy for the DOJ and the Obama administration, but noted that the change was necessary due to cases pending in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Holder explained that when the DOJ previously defended DOMA it had done so in jurisdictions with binding precedent stating that a permissive standard of review was applicable to laws dealing with sexual orientation. The announcement came just one month after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/doj-files-brief-defending-constitutionality-of-defense-of-marriage-act.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] defending the constitutionality of DOMA. The appeal followed a July <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/federal-judge-strikes-down-defense-of-marriage-act.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which found that Section 3 of DOMA violates both the Equal Protection Clause under the Fifth Amendment and State Sovereignty under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/tenth_amendment">Tenth Amendment</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Bashir has been accused of crimes against humanity and genocide against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3496731.stm">Darfur</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/darfur.php">news archive</a>] tribal groups. Upon news of a scheduled visit with <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2404129.stm">President Hu Jintao</a> [BBC profile], China <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/china-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">came under pressure</a> [JURIST report] from the international community to arrest al-Bashir but did not respond. The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], which issued the arrest warrant, has no police or authority to enforce it without cooperation from governments. Pillay said she was disappointed with China's failure to arrest al-Bashir and that every nation has a duty and responsibility to bring justice to those indicted by the court. China has not commented on the visit, although al-Bashir reportedly met a "red carpet" reception on Wednesday.

<p>China is not currently a party to the ICC's <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/english/rome_statute%28e%29.pdf">Rome Statute</a> [text, PDF] and therefore has no obligation to the international community to arrest al-Bashir. China is, however, a permanent member of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website], which formally referred the Darfur case to <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a>, lead prosecutor for the ICC. In joining the council, China agreed to cooperate with ICC decisions. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/icc-charges-al--bashir-with-genocide.php">charged al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] with <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc907140.pdf">three counts of genocide</a> [warrant, PDF] in relation to the Darfur conflict, in addition to seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity that were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">filed against al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in March 2009. The international community and human rights groups have urged various countries to arrest al-Bashir while he has been present inside their borders. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/malaysia-urged-to-arrest-sudan-president-for-war-crimes.php">called on Malaysia</a> [JURIST report] to withdraw its invitation to al-Bashir and arrest him if he travels to the country. Similarly, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/icc-urges-djibouti-to-cooperate-with-arrest-of-al-bashir.php">urged Djibouti to arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] in May. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/icc-urges-kenya-to-arrest-al-bashir.php">ICC requested that Kenya arrest al-Bashir</a> [JURIST report] during an October visit last year, his second visit to the country in the same year. Previously, al-Bashir had visited Kenya for the signing of the country's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/kenya-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law.php">new constitution</a> [JURIST report]. Following his visit, the ICC <a target="_blank" href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc930979.pdf">reported Kenya</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/icc-reports-kenya-to-un-over-al-bashir-visit.php">report</a>] to the UN Security Council and the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute for the violation in not arresting al-Bashir.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The warrants were issued for Mustafa Badreddine, Salim al-Ayyash, Hasan Aineysseh and Asad Sabra, who are <a href = "http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2011/Jun-30/STL-delegation-meets-with-state-prosecutor.ashx#axzz1Qm6bjcSK">alleged members</a> [<em>Lebanon Daily Star</em> report] of <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder]. Lebanon has 30 days to arrest the suspects before the STL personally summons them and makes the indictment public. In a <a href = "http://www.najib-mikati.net/NewsDetailsArabic.aspx?ID=3807&CatID=0&MID=&PID=86,86">press conference</a> [press release, in Arabic], <a href = "http://www.najib-mikati.net/indexEnglish.aspx">Prime Minister Najib Mikati</A> [official website] stated that "the indictments, from whatever source, [are] not sentences, and the charges need to contain compelling evidence beyond any doubt, and that every defendant is innocent until proven guilty." Many have <a href = "http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/06/2011630103132763170.html">interpreted</a> [Al Jazeera report] this statement as an indication that Hezbollah members will not be arrested. Although Mikati was endorsed in the election by Hezbollah, he said he will not "take sides." 

<p>In February, the appeals chamber of the STL issued a unanimous <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/News/Summary%20of%20Decision_16%20February%20(EN).pdf">ruling</a> [summary, PDF; <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/sid/250">press release</a>] on several procedural issues, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-defines-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">including the definition of terrorism</a> [JURIST report], in judicial proceedings. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> [JURIST report] to determine which laws to apply in the case against persons accused of involvement in the February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. Using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Article 314 of the Lebanese Criminal Code</a> [text, PDF] the court held that a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger," that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case. In August, Hezbollah <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-receives-evidece-from-hezbollah-on-ex-pm-murder.php">submitted evidence to the STL</a> [JURIST report] linking Israel with the bombing. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/lebanon-tribunal-calls-for-evidence-in-ex-pm-murder.php">asked for the evidence</a> [JURIST report] a week earlier after Hezbollah Secretary General <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile] claimed to have proof that Israel was behind the bombing. Last February, the head of the STL <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/lebanon-tribunal-head-says-hariri-probe.php">reassured</a> [JURIST report] the Lebanese public that the investigation is on track. When asked about the progress of the investigation into the death of Hariri, the head of the STL "underlined the fact that the Tribunal already has in place all the legal and administrative instruments necessary for its work, and is fully operational so that justice may be dispensed with complete independence and impartiality in accordance with the highest international standards." The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Lee and a top aide, Liu Tai-ying, were <a href="http://www.newser.com/article/d9o5v2vo0/former-taiwan-president-lee-teng-hui-indicted-on-charge-of-embezzling-state-fund.html">charged with embezzling $7.79 million</a> [AP report] from a <a href="http://www.nsb.gov.tw/">National Security Bureau</a> [official website, in Chinese] fund to set up a think tank, <a href="http://www.tri.org.tw/english/">Taiwan Research Institute</a> [official website]. Prosecutors said Lee promised $10.5 million to the government of South Africa in 1994, wired the money to the <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.tw/webapp/mp.asp?mp=6">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> (MOFA) [official website], but reimbursed a fraction of the donation to the NSB. Lee, allegedly pocketing the balance, intended to amass funds and research for a private venture after leaving the presidency. Lee stepped down from the presidency after 12 years in 2000 and has denied taking money from the NSB.

<p>Lee is the second former Taiwanese high-ranking official accused of embezzlement. Former president <a target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chen+Shui-bian">news archive</a>] and his wife were accused of taking more than $20 million in bribes from banks and financial institutions that sought to protect themselves during the implementation of Chen's financial reform program. The pair were initially <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to life in prison</a> in September 2009 after being convicted of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery and money laundering, but the sentences were <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/taiwan-supreme-court-reduces-sentence-for-ex-president-chen.php">ultimately reduced to 11 years</a> [JURIST reports]. Chen was again <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/taiwan-ex-president-chen-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] shortly after the September sentence on additional corruption charges relating to funds he received while traveling abroad as president. Chen was initially detained in November 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">formally indicted</a> [JURIST report] the following month. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">unsuccessfully appealed</a> [JURIST report] his pretrial detention in January 2009. Chen served as president of Taiwan from 2000-2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision closely follows the recent 5-4 <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision issued earlier this week in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/10-238">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-Arizona-campaign-finance-restriction.php">report</a>] striking down a similar Arizona campaign finance law on <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] grounds. Florida <a href="http://www.rickscottforflorida.com/">Governor Rick Scott</a> (R) [campaign website] filed the lawsuit during the Republican primary in which he was running against former attorney general <a href="http://www.billmccollum.com/">Bill McCollum</a> (R) [campaign website] who chose to use public financing. Scott <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/06/30/2291922/judge-strikes-down-florida-campaign.html">argued the law violated his First Amendment rights</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] because it limited his campaign expenditures to $24.9 million since every dollar over would be matched in public funding for his opponent. Judge Robert Hinkle ruled that Florida must not enforce the law. He had previously granted a temporary injunction during the election preventing McCollum from receiving tax-payer funding. The law was a non-issue in the general election since Scott's competitor <a href="http://www.alexsink2010.com/">Alex Sink</a> (D) [campaign website] also chose to forgo public financing. Scott spent over $70 million of his own money during the election. 

<p>In <span class="casename">Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</span> the Supreme Court found that an Arizona matching funds law was unconstitutional, reasoning that such a scheme is substantially burdensome on the privately-funded candidates because it harms them for exercising First Amendment rights to raise and/or spend their own money on their campaign. The court further said that it has never held that the state's interest in leveling the playing field is enough to suppress or alter political speech. Last month, the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-minnesota-campaign-finance-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Minnesota campaign finance law prohibiting direct contributions to candidates and affiliated entities. In April, a judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-judge-upholds-wisconsin-supreme-court-campaign-finance-law.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] two challenges to campaign financing schemes for Wisconsin Supreme Court elections brought by groups arguing the schemes violate their First Amendment rights. </p>]]></content:encoded>

It is unknown when the US <a href = "http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] will vote on the bill or if it will pass.

<p>This has not been the only effort to streamline governmental red tape. Last year, President Barack Obama signed the Plain Writing Act into law, forcing any governmental "letter, publication, form, notice, or instruction" to be written in "plain writing": "writing that is clear, concise, well-organized, and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience."

The retroactive sentencing will go into effect with the law on November 1, unless Congress acts to stop the USSC's decision by then. The USSC estimates that this will affect the sentences of 12,000 federal inmates. However, the decision does not mean that all prior offenders will be eligible for reduced sentences. It will still be up to a federal sentencing judge to determine whether the particular offender is eligible based on a consideration of many factors, including whether releasing the offender would harm to public safety. Judge Patti B. Saris said: <blockquote>The Commission is aware of concern that today's actions may negatively impact public safety. However, every potential offender must have his or her case considered by a federal district court judge in accordance with the Commission's policy statement, and with careful thought given to the offender's potential risk to public safety. The average sentence for a federal crack cocaine offender will remain significant at about 127 months.</blockquote> The decision is identical to the position taken by US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website], who <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/Legislative_and_Public_Affairs/Public_Hearings_and_Meetings/20110601/Testimony_AG_Eric_Holder.pdf">testified</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/06/holder-calls-for-retroactive-application-of-crack-sentencing-law.php">report</a>] before the USSC in June.

<p>The Fair Sentencing Act amended existing law to reduce the current sentencing ratio from 100:1 to 18:1. Under the existing law passed in 1986, an individual possessing five grams of crack cocaine would receive a mandatory five-year prison sentence, while an individual possessing powder cocaine would need to have 100 times that amount to receive the same sentence.  President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/obama-signs-bill-to-reduce-cocaine-sentencing-disparity.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Fair Sentencing Act into law last year. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/28/us-end-sight-infamous-crack-cocaine">praised</a> [press release] the bill's passage, stating that the old law also created a racial disparity, with African Americans comprising 79.8 percent of all offenders sentenced for crack cocaine violations. In April 2008, a study released by the USSC reported that more than 3,000 prison inmates convicted of crack cocaine offenses <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-3000-sentences-reduced-under.php">had their sentences reduced</a> [JURIST report] under an amendment to the <a href="http://www.ussc.gov/guidelin.htm">Federal Sentencing Guidelines</a> [materials]. In 2007, the <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-sentencing-panel-backs-retroactive.php">USSC voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to give retroactive effect to an earlier sentencing guideline amendment that reduced crack cocaine penalties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The high court <a href="http://scc.lexum.org/en/news_release/2011/11-06-30.3a/11-06-30.3a.pdf">granted an application for leave to appeal</a> [judgment, PDF] filed by Khawaja challenging the life sentence imposed by the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/coa/en/">Ontario Court of Appeals</a> [official website]. Khawaja, the first person to be charged and tried under the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=e&amp;chamber=n&amp;startlist=a&amp;endlist=z&amp;session=9&amp;type=0&amp;scope=i&amp;query=2981&amp;list=toc-1">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> [text; CBC <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/">backgrounder</a>], was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/canada-court-convicts-first-suspect.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008 of designing a remote detonator and providing other support to a group that was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/uk-court-sentences-five-to-life-for.php">convicted in 2007</a> [JURIST report] of planning to detonate a large fertilizer bomb. When <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Ontario Superior Court</a> [official website] Justice Douglas Rutherford <a href="http://images.theglobeandmail.com/v5/content/pdf/ReasonsforSentences0312.pdf">sentenced Khawaja</a> [reasons for sentence, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/canada-court-sentences-first-suspect.php">report</a>], prosecutors asked that he be given more than two life sentences.

Environmental groups and the state of Alaska were in conflict as to the proper way to address the bears' protection, with environmental groups wanting more protection and Alaska arguing that the listing was unnecessary because of other existing laws and the alleged uncertainty of climate science. The court, however, ruled in favor of the FWS:<blockquote>Some plaintiffs in this case believe that the Service went too far in protecting the polar bear; others contend that the Service did not go far enough. According to some plaintiffs, mainstream climate science shows that the polar bear is already irretrievably headed toward extinction throughout its range. According to others, climate science is too uncertain to support any reliable predictions about the future of polar bears. However, this Court is not empowered to choose among these competing views. Although plaintiffs have proposed many alternative conclusions that the agency could have drawn with respect to the status of the polar bear, the Court cannot substitute either the plaintiffs' or its own judgment for that of the agency. Instead, this Court is bound to uphold the agency's determination that the polar bear is a threatened species as long as it is reasonable, regardless of whether there may be other reasonable, or even more reasonable, views. That is particularly true where, as here, the agency is operating at the frontiers of science.</blockquote>Although polar bears are at an unendangered population now, it is predicted that <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQVABxNmx9P8xSlu8HhiGKdq0Mdg?docId=7cc320ff2ca6455282dc249e928af46a">melting ice caps will kill 10,000 of the species</a> [AP report].

<p>In 2009, the Obama Administration received criticism for preserving the controversial Bush-era <a href="http://www.defenders.org/resources/publications/programs_and_policy/in_the_courts/final_usfws_4(d)_rule_for_polar_bears.pdf">rule</a> [text, PDF] that limits how polar bears are protected from global warming. <a href="http://www.doi.gov/whoweare/secretarysalazar.cfm">Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar</a> [official profile] had received special permission from Congress to amend the rule, which prevented the use of the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/esa73.pdf">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) [text, PDF] to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Polar bears are protected under the ESA, and environmentalists have argued that the release of greenhouse gases has contributed to global warming, which is destroying the polar bear's arctic habitat. The rule was put in place in December 2008 after the polar bear was listed as threatened on the endangered species list in May 2008. The <a href="http://www.doi.gov/index.cfm">Department of the Interior</a> [official website] made the designation more than two years after the <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a>, <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/">Greenpeace</a> and the <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> [advocacy websites] petitioned to protect the polar bear under the ESA. Shortly after that, then-Alaska governor Sarah Palin announced that her office would <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/alaska-filing-legal-challenge-to-polar.php">launch a court challenge</a> [JURIST report] to the listing of the polar bear on the endangered species list. Palin argued that the designation of the polar bear as "threatened" would have a negative impact on development in Alaska.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In March, the FTC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">settled a similar privacy lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Google over charges that the Internet giant breached consumer privacy rights and was misleading during the launch of Buzz. The FTC alleges that when Google launched Buzz through its web-based email, Gmail, users were automatically enrolled without their consent and were unable to decline or leave the social network and that the Buzz privacy controls were confusing. Google has recently faced a number of allegations of violating privacy laws, both in the US and abroad. In November, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] confirmed that it is <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/fcc-investigating-google-for-street-view-privacy-breach.php">investigating</a> [JURIST report] Google to determine if it violated communications laws when its Street View vehicles inadvertently collected private user data, including passwords and URLs, over WiFi networks. In October, the FTC <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/us-federal-trade-commission-ends-google-inquiry.php">ended an inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the company's data collection through Street View cars after Google assured the FTC that it did not use any of the collected data and announced that it was <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/creating-stronger-privacy-controls.html">committed to compliance with privacy laws</a> [text], instituting new training on privacy principles and appointing a new director of privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Former attorney general Michael Mukasey had appointed Assistant United States Attorney John Durham in 2008 to conduct a criminal investigation into the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">destruction of 92 interrogation videotapes</a> [JURIST report] by the CIA and to determine whether federal laws were violated during overseas interrogations. After extensive investigation, Durham recommended that Holder order a full criminal investigation into the deaths of two particular detainees, but that criminal investigations of the remaining cases was unwarranted. Holder stated that he would not prosecute anyone in the CIA acting in good faith or under the advice of the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/olc/">Office of Legal Counsel</a> [official website], but investigations into the two deaths will be ongoing.

<p>In January, a federal judge told the CIA that it must <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-tells-cia-to-investigate-destruction-of-interrogation-tapes.php">investigate the destruction of the interrogation tapes</a> [JURIST report] related to individuals detained after <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Internal CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p01-09.pdf">documents</a> [part 1, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p10-18.pdf">part 2</a>, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/cia_release20100415_p19-27.pdf">part 3</a>, PDF] released last year reveal that the former head of the agency Porter Goss may have <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/cia-documents-reveal-possible-cover-up.php">agreed to the destruction</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive] showing harsh interrogations of terror suspects. According to redacted <a href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/030609/paragraph_77.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF] filed in March 2009, 12 of 92 videotapes contained evidence of "enhanced interrogation techniques." The DOJ had acknowledged in March 2009 that the CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF] the videotapes of high value terrorism suspect interrogations in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information. The August 2008 order came in response to a December 2007 ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/aclu_v_dod_memo_contemptmotion.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA be held in contempt of court for not providing information on the tapes during a <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/amended-foia-redlined-2010.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/accountability/released.html">lawsuit</a> [ACLU materials] brought by the organization in an effort to access government materials on the interrogations.</p>]]></content:encoded>
