		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Zimbabwean human rights activist <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=38377691731">Jestina Mukoko</a> [advocacy website, JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=mukoko">news archive</a>] was released on bail Monday after three months of detention on the authorization of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>]. Mukoko, director of the <a href="http://www.kubatana.net/html/sectors/zim028.asp?like=Z&details=Tel&orgcode=zim028, official website">Zimbabwe Peace Project</a> (ZPP) [official website], had been held without chargers since December and was allegedly subjected to torture during her incarceration. Mukoko has been <a href="http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=12668">hospitalized</a> [<em>Zimbabwe Times</em> report] for the treatment of injuries sustained over the past three months and remains under medical care after her release from police custody. Mukoko&#8217;s release may come as a <a href="http://www.zimonline.co.za/Article.aspx?ArticleId=4322">response</a> [ZimOnline report] to a call by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1870283.stm">Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tsvangirai">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-rights-head-calls-on-zimbabwe.php">installed last month</a> after <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/zimbabwe-leaders-sign-power-sharing.php">signing a power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST reports] with Mugabe.  <br /><br />Mukoko, an outspoken critic of Mugabe, was apprehended from her home in December and held in an undisclosed location for months because of her alleged involvement in Mugabe&#39;s opposition. While in prison, it was reported that Mukoko was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/human-rights-activist-jestina-mukoko.php">forced to ingest poison</a> [JURIST report], an allegation that has sparked a world wide protest against Zimbabwean police methods. Mukoko was previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-judge-denies-bail-for.php">denied bail</a> [JURIST report] by Zimbabwean lower courts. Last month, a court ruled that Mukoko could <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/zimbabwe-court-rules-rights-activist.php">appeal her detention</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe under the <a href="http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/africa/ZW/zimbabwe-constitution-of-zimbabwe-2008/at_download/file">Zimbabwe Constitution</a> [text, PDF].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge from the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ECCC">news archive</a>] announced on Monday that the ECCC&#39;s Cambodian employees will not be paid in March. The UN-backed tribunal is staffed by both local and international workers, and the funding shortage is expected to cause some employees <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gkvDgd_ZwL0x_nwAEl-0V3V4iURAD96LUEEO6">to stop working</a> [AP report].  The ECCC has seen a reduction in funding following <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-warns-cambodia-khmer-rouge.php">questioning of its credibility</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/cambodia-khmer-rouge-trials-at-risk-of.php">allegations of corruption</a> [JURIST reports]. An ECCC employee has alleged that <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009022724472/National-news/Tribunal-graft-charges-spread.html">the court&#39;s kickback system</a> [<em>Phnom Penh Post</em> report] required workers to remit 70 percent of their salaries for the first four months of employment, and 10 percent thereafter. The UN stopped funding the Cambodian side of the ECCC last July due to the corruption allegations, forcing the court to rely on international donations. The ECCC judges have <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/cambodia-genocide-judges-deny.php">denied participation</a> [JURIST report] in any of the alleged corruption.<br /><br />Last week, UN assistant secretary general for legal affairs Peter Taksoe-Jensen <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/cambodia-war-crimes-court-subject-of.php">met with</a> [JURIST report] Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister <a href="http://khmergovernmentoffice.org/eng/khmer/biography.php">Sok An</a> [official profile] to discuss the allegations of wrongdoing in the ECCC, including a possible anti-corruption mechanism for the court. Fears of the ECCC&#39;s bankruptcy come despite a <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/japan-promises-more-aid-to-cambodia.php">pledge from Japan</a> [JURIST report] to donate an additional $21 million. The ECCC, which was created in 2006 to try former <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder, JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Khmer+Rouge+regime">news archive</a>] leaders, announced last June that it planned to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-aims-to.php">end its operations</a> [JURIST report] a year early because of limited funding.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN special rapporteur on torture <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/torture/rapporteur/">Manfred Nowak</a> [official website] has told the British government that the United Kingdom may have <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/01/united-nations-britain-torture-mi5">acquiesced</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] in the mistreatment of terror suspect detainees and thereby violated the UN <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text]. The <em>Guardian</em> reported Sunday that, according to Nowak, Britain&#39;s <a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website] security service may have been complicit in mistreating detainees in US custody. Nowak said the privilege of state secrecy should not impede probes into torture allegations and that he is looking to organize a fact-finding mission to Pakistan to investigate the mistreatment claims. Britain&#39;s <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> [official website] has said it investigates all claims of mistreatment involving British officials.<br /><br />Nowak&#39;s criticism came as the government faces <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/02/binyam-mohamed-rendition-inquiry">mounting pressure</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report] to investigate claims British residents were tortured at Guantanamo. <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/Reprieve.htm_staff_zacharykatznelson.htm">Zachary Katznelson</a> [advocacy  website], lawyer for Guantanamo detainee Shaker Aamer, said Sunday that British officers were present when <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFL180sgT0Tc4CKGXoo6U3U59w_gD96L88LO2">Aamer was beaten</a> [AP report] in US custody in Afghanistan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]&nbsp;The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-02-09.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb09.shtml">briefs</a>] in two cases on Monday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-6.pdf">District Attorney&#8217;s Office v. Osborne</a> [argument transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-takes-dna-evidence-and.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on&nbsp;whether a defendant has the right to obtain post-conviction access to the state&#8217;s biological evidence under <a href="http://www2.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001983----000-.html">Section 1983</a> [text] or the Fourteenth Amendment&#39;s Due Process clause. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/FC287DD2DAEA120B8825741F0000A029/$file/0635875.pdf?openelement">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Osborne has a right to access the evidence against him on appeal, even though his lawyer made a strategic decision to forgo independent DNA analysis for the trial. The petitioner in the case, the State of Alaska, argued that Osborne does not have a right to the evidence under Section 1983 because the state already allows defendants to access such evidence through a <font style="font-style:italic;">habeas corpus</font> petition if they have made an appeal based on actual innocence, which Osborne has not done.<br /><br />In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-214.pdf">Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend</a> [argument transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-takes-dna-evidence-and.php">report</a>], the Court heard arguments on whether an injured seaman may recover punitive damages for the willful failure of his employer to pay a basic living allowance, wages that he otherwise would have earned, and benefits to cover medical expenses. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit had <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200613204.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court ruling that Townsend could recover the damages. Atlantic Sounding, the petitioner in case, contended that the applicable statutes, the <a href="http://www.shipguide.com/jones-act/">Jones Act</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title46a/46a_16_.html">Death on the High Seas Act</a> [text], do not provide for such expenses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israeli Attorney General <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2004/1/Menahem%20Mazuz%20-%20Attorney%20General">Meni Mazuz</a> [official profile] informed outgoing Prime Minister <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/PM/Resume/">Ehmud Olmert</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=olmert">news archive</a>] Sunday that he intends to file an indictment against him in the District Court of Jerusalem for receiving illicit funds. Charges stemming from Olmert&#39;s alleged acceptance of cash contributions from Jewish-American businessman <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/prosecutor-alleges-israel-pm-accepted.php">Morris Talansky</a> [JURIST report] could possibly include fraud, violation of public confidence, and the receipt of illicit perquisites. Should an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ic6RWeorIMHJ_dmXOp7pIN3VWKiwD96LH2LO0">indictment be filed</a> [AP report], it would be based on Talansky&#8217;s statements obtained during a series of pre-trial depositions and cross-examinations conducted in May and July 2008, in which Talansky stated that Olmert had asked him for approximately <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/987696.html">$150,000</a> [<em>Ha&#39;aretz</em> report] over a fifteen-year period. If proven, receipt of the funds would constitute abuse of Olmert&#39;s public position in violation of the <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/financelaw.html">1973 Party Financing Law</a> [text]. Olmert, who has denied the allegations against him, will be given a final pre-trial hearing to dissuade Mazuz from filing charges. Although Talansky denies receiving any favors in return for his contributions, may yet <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/world/middleeast/18olmert.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">face charges</a> [NYT report] of his own in a US court.<br /><br />In addition to the currently pending indictment, the Israel Ministry of Justice is also considering filing indictments for Olmert&#8217;s other alleged corruption offense, including the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/israel-attorney-general-considering.php">double billing </a> [JURIST report] of the state and charitable donors for travel expenses in 2002-2006. The preliminary testimony obtained from Talansky in May 2008 led to Olmert&#8217;s resignation from his post as PM last September. Olmert remains acting PM until recently-elected successor Benjamin Netanyahu formally takes office.

Al-Majid, better known in the Western Media as &quot;Chemical Ali,&quot; and a cousin of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, was convicted along with two other former Iraqi officials in connection with the killings of protesters who <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/marsharabs1.htm">rioted</a> [HRW backgrounder] in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr - father of anti-American cleric <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/7637/">Muqtada al-Sadr</a> [CFR profile] - by Hussein agents.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] on Monday <a href="http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/03-02-2009/0004981236&EDATE=">reaffirmed his opposition</a> [speech text] to <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=waterboarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive] as an acceptable interrogation device. In a speech before the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Holder emphasized the need to return to the ideals of the US.<blockquote>As I unequivocally stated in my confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate, waterboarding is torture. My Justice Department will not justify it, rationalize it, or condone it. The sanction of torture is at odds with the history of American jurisprudence and American principles. It undermines our ability to pursue justice fairly, and it puts our own brave soldiers in peril should they ever be captured on a foreign battlefield.</blockquote>Holder previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/holder-condemns-waterboarding-as.php">condemned waterboarding as torture</a> [JURIST report] during his confirmation hearings before the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website]. President Barack Obama has also <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-not-ruling-out-prosecution-of.php">not ruled out prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of senior Bush officials for crimes allegedly committed during the administration.<br /><br />In January, outgoing <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] director <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=michael+hayden">Michael Hayden</a> [JURIST news archive] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/outgoing-cia-director-defends-use-of.php">defended the controversial interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST report] used to gather information in the &quot;war on terror,&quot; including waterboarding, a practice Hayden banned from use in 2006. The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] released three <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/36104res20080724.html">memos</a> [materials; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/enhanced-interrogation-techniques-can.php">report</a>] in July 2008 indicating that certain harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, are lawful and that those who employ them in good faith lack the specific intent required to be charged with torture, in direct opposition to the 2006 <a href="http://www.army.mil/institution/armypublicaffairs/pdf/fm2-22-3.pdf">Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations</a> [text, PDF], which prohibits waterboarding. In February 2008, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/doj-investigating-cia-waterboarding.php">launched an internal probe</a> [JURIST report] into whether top department officials improperly approved the CIA&#39;s use of waterboarding. In 2007, former CIA director <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3774157.stm">George Tenet</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/former-cia-director-denies-use-of.php">denied that torture was used</a> [JURIST report] in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks while refusing to go into details of technique. Former attorney general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6998267.stm">Michael Mukasey</a> [BBC profile] repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/white-house-defends-mukasey-refusal-to.php">refused to say</a> [JURIST report] whether waterboarding was torture. Later in 2007, retired CIA agent John Kiriakou <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/ex-cia-agent-confirms-use-of.php">confirmed the use of waterboarding</a> [JURIST report] on al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/home/home_en.htm">EU Agency for Fundamental Rights</a> (FRA) [official website] said in a <a href="http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/Antisemitism_Update_2009.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] released Monday that incidents of <a href="/currentawareness/antisemitism.php">anti-Semitism</a> [JURIST news archive] have increased in the EU since December 2008 after declining in 2007 and 2008. The report found &quot;an increase in anti-Semitic activity between 2001 and 2002, between 2003 and 2004 and again in 2006, but a decrease in 2007 and 2008.&quot;  The FRA, however, said it lacked sufficient data to establish whether anti-Semitism had increased or decreased between 2001 and 2008.  The report compiled trends in anti-Semitism by country and the methods that each country used to track those trends. The report concluded, however, that anti-Semitic incidents are under-reported in Europe and that only France, Sweden, and Germany collect enough data to observe trends within individual nations.  FRA head Morten Kjaerum speculated that the situation in the Middle East and the global financial crisis could be responsible for the recent increase, but the FRA report itself cautioned that <blockquote>...due to the overall paucity of data, only speculative conclusions can be drawn for the European Union, as a whole, as to how different political developments in the Middle East could influence attitudes and behaviour of Arab and Muslim European communities, as well as the rhetoric and activities of the extreme and far- right and to some extend the extreme left.</blockquote>  The FRA said it will closely monitor the situation and issue an update in 2010.<br /><br />In November, the German parliament passed a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/german-lawmakers-pass-anti-semitism.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] requiring the government to track reports of anti-Semitism in the country and fund education to combat the problem.  The Council of Europe released a <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/council-of-europe-report-urges-nations.php">report</a> [JURIST report] in July emphasizing the need for European countries to examine their human rights records.  Monday&#39;s report is the fifth update of the FRA&#39;s 2004 &quot;<a href="http://eumc.eu.int/eumc/as/PDF04/AS-Main-report-PDF04.pdf">Manifestations of anti-Semitism in the EU</a>&quot; [text, PDF].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] One in 31 US adults are on probation, in prison, or on parole, according to a <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/PSPP_1in31_report_FINAL_WEB_2-27-09.pdf">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=49398">press release</a>] released Monday by the <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/">Pew Center on the States</a> [advocacy website]. The report found that men are five times more likely than women to be under correctional control, although the number of women continues to grow. Black adults are four times more likely than white adults to be under correctional supervision. These correctional controls cost an escalating $68 billion per year, without an apparent change in recidivism rates. The report states:<blockquote>With the costs of imprisonment rising and the benefits falling, our ability to keep communities safe depends more than ever upon our ability to better manage the 5 million offenders on probation and parole. The current budget crisis presents states with an important, perhaps unprecedented opportunity to do so. Rather than trying to weather the economic storm with short-term cost saving measures, policy leaders should see this as a chance to retool their sentencing and corrections systems.</blockquote>With the current total of 7.3 million adults under correctional control, the report outlines a six-step strategy to manage the growing population, including sorting offenders by risk to the public safety, basing intervention programs on science, harnessing technology, imposing swift and certain sanctions, creating incentives for success, and measuring progress.<br /><br />The US currently has the highest inmate population in the world with the US Department of Justice <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a> (BJS) [official website] reporting last month a total of <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/p07.pdf">2.3 million adults</a> [text, PDF] in prison for 2007. A Pew Center <a href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/One%20in%20100.pdf">report</a> [report, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/one-in-100-us-adults-in-prison-pew.php">report</a>] released last year corroborates the BJS report and estimates <a href="http://english.gov.cn/">China</a> [official website] has the second largest inmate population with 1.5 million. The rising number of inmates has long been a major concern within the US as the current prison population was reported in 2007 to be <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/us-incarceration-supervised-release.php">eight times</a> [JURIST report] the number in 1970.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN on Monday <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2009/ga10811.doc.htm">appointed</a> [UN press release release] five new judges to serve on the UN Dispute Tribunal, and seven new judges, including one American, to the UN Appeals Tribunal. The tribunals were authorized in 2007, pursuant to UN General Assembly <a href="http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-62-228.pdf">resolution 62/228</a> [text, PDF], and the appeals tribunal is charged with appellate review of grievance and discipline disputes between UN members heard in the dispute tribunal. The American judge, <a href="http://www.judgepainter.org/">Mark Painter</a> [official website], is a member of the <a href="http://www.hamilton-co.org/appealscourt/">Hamilton County Court of Appeals</a> [court website] in Cincinnati, Ohio. Painter is one of three of the chosen judges who will serve an initial three-year term on the tribunal. At the conclusion of the three-year term, each of those three judges may apply for a non-renewable, seven-year term. The other four appointed judges will each sit on the tribunal for a single seven-year, non-renewable term. The UN anticipates that both the Dispute and Appeals Tribunals will be operational as of July 1, 2009.<br /><br />The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2008/080724_Justice.doc.htm">Internal Justice Council</a> (IJC) [UN background] was responsible for advising the General Assembly on appropriate judges for the two tribunals. The IJC was formed in 2007 following an <a href="http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N06/449/11/PDF/N0644911.pdf?OpenElement">independent review</a> [UN release] of UN internal justice procedures. The two-tiered tribunal system was also one of the suggestions put forth by the independent &quot;Redesign Panel,&quot; convened in 2006 at the behest of the General Assembly, after then-Secretary General Kofi Annan <a href="http://www.un.org/reform/investinginun/chap1.shtml">called</a> [UN report] the UN&#39;s  internal justice system, &quot;slow and cumbersome.&quot;

The government plans to organize a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jWHK1_e5aHDizUpee0x6O-h7TiTwD96L90980">special tribunal</a> [AP report] to try the organizers of the revolt. Among those charged are six accused of planning the revolt, including four deputy assistant directors. The government said that a previous offer of amnesty from <a href="http://www.bangladesh.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=76&Itemid=142">Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina&#39;s</a> [official profile] <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=77542&cid=2">would not apply</a> [bdnews24 report] to those directly involved in the mutiny. The revolt was motivated by disputes over pay, conditions and the selection of top officers from the regular army rather than from within the BDR.<br /><br />The incident comes in a time of difficult transition for Bangladesh. Bangladesh voters elected Hasina in December 2008, ending two years of military rule. In January, Bangladeshi Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs Minister <a href="http://www.minlaw.gov.bd/indexin.htm">Shafique Ahmed</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/bangladesh-government-declares-desire.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] his government&#39;s desire to restore Bangladesh&#39;s <a href="http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/asia/BD/Bangladesh%20Constitution%201972.pdf">1972 constitution</a> [text, PDF].  Prior to the elections, interim Bangladeshi president <a href="http://www.bangabhaban.gov.bd/pprofile.html">Iajuddin Ahmed</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/bangladesh-lifts-two-year-emergency.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Emergency Powers (Repeal) Ordinance of 2008, lifting a two-year state of emergency to allow for political campaigning. The state of emergency, <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/bangladesh-president-declares-state-of.php">declared in January 2007</a> [JURIST report], had suspended democratic rights throughout the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] decided two cases Tuesday. In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-463">Summers v. Earth Island Institute</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-hears-navy-sonar-sexual.php">report</a>] the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-463.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 that a group of environmentalists cannot sue to have a Forest Service regulation struck down, as they are limited only to suing to end programs enacted under that regulation. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia found that the environmental groups lacked standing:<blockquote>Respondents argue that they have standing to bring their challenge because they have suffered procedural injury, namely that they have been denied the ability to file comments on some Forest Service actions and will continue to be so denied. But deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation - a procedural right <em>in vacuo</em> - is insufficient to create Article III standing. Only a &quot;person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.&quot;</blockquote>Justice Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined, finding the Court&#39;s ruling &quot;counter-intuitive&quot;. The Court affirmed in part and reversed in part the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/07-463_ob.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that the environmentalists could sue against the regulation itself.<br /><br />In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-499">Negusie v. Holder</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-hears-asylum.php">report</a>] the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-499.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 8-1 that the so-called &quot;persecutor bar&quot; in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/propub/ProPubVAP.jsp?dockey=c9fef57852dc066cfe16a4cb816838a4">Immigration and Naturalization Act</a> (INA) [text], which prohibits the attorney general or secretary of Homeland Security from granting asylum or stay of deportation to any person who &quot;ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution&quot; of any person on account of &quot;race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,&quot; does not apply to a person who committed such an act due to &quot;credible threats of death or serious bodily harm.&quot; The case concerned Daniel Girmai Negusie, a citizen of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=eritrea">Eritrea</a> [JURIST news archive], who was forcibly conscripted into the Eritrean army during its ongoing war with <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> [JURIST news archive], imprisoned, and forced to work as an armed prison guard at a facility where inmates were tortured and mistreated. He eventually escaped and made his way to the US, where he applied for asylum. An immigration judge denied his asylum application on the grounds that his service as a prison guard made him ineligible for asylum protection under the INA, and the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> (BIA) [official website] affirmed. Kennedy wrote for the Court:<blockquote>The question here is whether an alien who was compelled to assist in persecution can be eligible for asylum or withholding of removal. We conclude that the BIA misapplied our precedent in Fedorenko as mandating that an alien&#8217;s motivation and intent are irrelevant to the issue whether an alien assisted in persecution. The agency must confront the same question free of this mistaken legal premise.</blockquote>Scalia filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Samuel Alito joined. Justice Stevens filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justice John Breyer joined. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion. The Court&#39;s ruling reversed the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cunpub%5C06/06-60193.0.wpd.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the BIA&#39;s denial of asylum and remanded the case for further consideration.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chinese courts have begun accepting lawsuits against dairy companies in the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=milk+scandal">contaminated milk scandal</a> [JURIST news archive], a court official announced Monday, departing from their previous policy. Shen Deyong, executive vice president of the <a href="http://www.court.gov.cn/">Supreme People&#39;s Court</a> [official website, in Mandarin], China&#39;s highest court, made the announcement the day after the Chinese government announced it had <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/02/content_10930243.htm">finished compensating the families</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Xinhua</span> report] whose children were sickened by the tainted milk. Prior to Tuesday&#39;s announcement, the only remedy available to the families was a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-dairy-companies-to-pay-160.php">government-sponsored compensation plan</a> [JURIST report] that paid families between USD $290 and $29,000. According to Shen, 95 percent of the families involved accepted the compensation, which supposedly precludes them from filing lawsuits. The Qingdao Intermediate Peoples Court became the first court to accept these lawsuits Monday when it <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-03/03/content_7529705.htm">accepted a lawsuit</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">China Daily</span> report] seeking USD $1.2 million on behalf of 54 families of children made ill by the tainted milk.<br /><br />Two people were <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-court-sentences-2-to-death-over.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] in January due to their roles in the scandal that killed six children and sickened nearly 300,000 others. Earlier that month, lawyers for the families of 213 Chinese children sickened or killed by the contaminated milk <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-lawyers-file-class-action-lawsuit.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme People&#39;s Court to hear a class action lawsuit against 22 dairy companies involved in the contamination, seeking more than $5 million in damages. In January, police in China detained <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-police-detain-parents-of-children.php">five parents</a> [JURIST report] of children who became sick after drinking melamine-tainted milk, preventing the parents from participating in a news conference.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK government&#39;s independent reviewer of terror laws on Sunday called for a judicial inquiry into British complicity in US rendition and torture. The reviewer, <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article3756858.ece">Lord Carlile of Berriew</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Times </span> profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=carlile">news archive</a>], specifically cited the case of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Binyam+Mohamed">Binyam Mohamed</a> [JURIST news archive], the British resident who alleges that he was tortured with the knowledge of <a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website] while held in US custody in Pakistan in 2002. Labour Party Deputy Leader <a href="http://www.harrietharman.org/about_harriet">Harriet Harman</a> [official profile] was non-committal, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7917418.stm">saying only</a> [BBC video; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7904218.stm">transcript</a>] that, &quot;We&#39;ll have to listen to what he [Berriew] says, but at the moment, we&#39;ve got an investigation by the Attorney General&quot;. Asked if she would rule out a judicial inquiry, Harman responded, &quot;We&#39;ll just have to see what lies ahead on that.&quot;<br /><br />British media reported Sunday that UN special rapporteur on torture Manfred Nowak  has told British ministers that <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-torture-investigator-warns-uk-over.php">MI5 may have been complicit</a> [JURIST report] in torture committed while detainees including Mohamed were in US custody. Mohamed <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php"> was returned to the UK</a> [JURIST report] last week following seven years of detention, including five at Guantanamo Bay, where he was held on charges of conspiring to commit terrorism. Those charges were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in October, however Mohamed remained in custody while US authorities considered filing new charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A military jury in Kentucky on Saturday sentenced US Army <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=behenna">First Lt. Michael Behenna</a> [JURIST news archive] to 25 years in prison after convicting him Friday of the murder and assault of an Iraqi detainee. The 101st Airborne Division officer, who claimed he acted in self-defense by shooting the victim, could have received a life sentence in the proceedings at <a href="http://www.campbell.army.mil/newinternet2/index.asp">Fort Campbell</a> [official website]. <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=hal+warner">Staff Sgt. Hal Warner</a> [JURIST news archive], who threw a grenade on the body of victim Ali Mansour Mohammed, initially thought to have been released by Coalition forces in May 2008, testified against Behenna after pleading guilty to assault, maltreatment of a subordinate and making a false statement. On Monday, the judge will hear Behenna&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jzuwkhrcOZ-H5K2HgCBMz-ICJ0nwD96KVB6O2">arguments for mistrial</a> [AP report], based on a claim that the prosecution withheld evidence. Behenna was acquitted on a charge of making a false statement.<br /><br />The US-led <a href="http://www.mnf-iraq.com/">Multi-National Force-Iraq</a> [official website] brought murder <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/two-us-soldiers-charged-in-death-of.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] against Behenna and Warner in August. In September, a US soldier and an Iraqi translator testified against Warner in a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/preliminary-hearing-concludes-for-us.php">preliminary hearing</a> [JURIST report]. Behenna&#39;s conviction follows the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-army-sergeant-convicted-in-murder-of.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] a week before of US Army Sgt. Michael Leahy Jr. on charges stemming from the 2007 deaths of four Iraqi detainees.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] More than 100 Serbian judges, prosecutors, and legal professionals <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/news/docs/EULEX-Press-Release-02-Mar-2009-Eng%20_2_.pdf">prevented the opening of the first EU-backed trial</a> [EULEX press release, PDF] in Kosovo by protesting in front of the <a href="http://www.osce.org/documents/mik/2008/04/1191_en.pdf">Mitrovica</a> [OSCE profile, PDF; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Mitrovica">news archive</a>] court house Monday. A panel of three judges had been set to preside over a criminal case involving two Serbian defendants. As Serbia and Kosovo&#39;s Serbian population have refused to accept Kosovo&#39;s independence, the demonstration was <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2009&mm=03&dd=02&nav_id=57524">intended to bar the EU from holding trial</a> [B92 report] in Kosovo except under UN laws. The trial court was established by <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/">European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website], an EU mission designed to guide Kosovo toward independence in accordance with the Rule of Law. Citing security concerns, the court has not yet rescheduled the trial.<br /><br />The EULEX <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">formally began operations</a> [JURIST report] in December. Kosovo controversially <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">seceded from Serbia</a> [JURIST report] in February 2008, and its new <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,246">constitution</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] in June. Kosovo&#39;s Declaration of Independence from Serbia was met with support from the EU, the US, and from many other countries. Serbia <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/MUMA-7BU3QJ?OpenDocument">formally condemned the secession</a> [text, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/serbia-denounces-expected-kosovo.php">report</a>], citing its illegality under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999). In response to the issuance of Kosovo&#39;s Declaration of Independence last March, <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/kosovo-serbs-take-over-un-courthouse-in.php">violent protests</a> in front of the Mitrovica courthouse led to a period of <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-police-recapture-courthouse-occupied.php">military law</a> [JURIST reports] in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/index.html">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) [official website], tasked with investigating the February 14, 2005 assassination of <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri</a> [JURIST news archive], officially began operating Sunday. The STL will be located in The Hague and the prosecution of its cases will be lead by <a href="http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2007/11/canadian_prosec.php">Daniel Bellemare</a> [<em>Ya Libnan</em> profile]. In an open letter to the Lebanese people, marking the end of the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8353.doc.htm">International Independent Investigation Commission</a> (IIIC) [authorizing resolution; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocusRel.asp?infocusID=110&Body=Leban&Body1=">materials</a>] into the assassination and the beginning of the STL&#39;s operations, Bellemare wrote that his goal as prosecutor was to maintain the tribunal&#39;s independence, while ensuring that those responsible for the killing were brought to justice:<blockquote>My commitment to you is to serve the cause of justice on the basis of a principled approach based solely on facts and evidence. Like the Commission, the Office of the Prosecutor will not be influenced by any political consideration. Justice can not and should not be used as a political tool. Like the Commission&#39;s work, the findings of the OTP investigations and the steps I would take as the Prosecutor, as well as the outcome of the STL should not be prejudged or speculated upon.<br /><br />The STL is not after revenge: it is after justice. Everybody, be they witnesses, detainees or accused, will be treated with dignity. Justice requires no less. Dignity is the hallmark of a credible and humane Justice process.<br /><br />Lastly, I want to reassure everybody that my team and I will do everything that is humanly and legally possible to ensure that the truth emerges and that those responsible for the crimes that fall within our jurisdiction are eventually brought to justice.<br /><br />This objective should not only be that of the Office of the Prosecutor, but it should also be the common and resolute goal of the People of Lebanon.</blockquote> Both the office of <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=3727">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> and the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/02/119896.htm">US State Department</a> [press releases] applauded the opening of the tribunal, but some Lebanese are <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=2&article_id=99760">skeptical of the court</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</font> report].<br /><br />In March 2008, Bellemare said he  believed a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-commission-suspects-criminal-network.php">criminal network was behind the assassination</a> [JURIST report], and the tribunal&#39;s registrar, <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ls/Vincent_bio.pdf">Robin Vincent</a> [official profile, PDF], said last month that it plans to ask the Lebanese government to <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=99597">transfer four generals</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-hariri-tribunal-to-begin-work-march.php">report</a>] being held on suspicion of involvement in Hariri&#39;s assassination to the court&#39;s custody. The STL will consist of 11 international and Lebanese judges and have a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-secures-first-year-funding-for.php">budget of $51 million</a> for its first year [JURIST reports]. The investigation into the assassination, which had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hariri-prosecutor-asks-security-council.php">extended</a> past its original anticipated end date and <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/un-hariri-probe-to-examine-killing-of.php">expanded</a> to cover other assassinations in the country, has increased existing tensions between Lebanon and Syria as several IIIC reports have <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-hariri-investigator-asks-security.php">implicated Syrian officials</a> in Hariri&#39;s death [JURIST reports].

Last month, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-rules-prosecution-may-amend.php">granted in part</a> [JURIST report] the prosecution&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/kar-mai080922e.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/icty-prosecutors-file-motion-to-amend.php">report</a>] to amend the indictment against Karadzic. When asked by Judge Iain Bonhomy whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty on the first charge of genocide, Karadzic <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7920594.stm">responded that he would not enter pleas</a> [video] because he believes the court has no right to try him. Bonhomy then entered on Karadzic&#39;s behalf not guilty pleas for all 11 charges.<br /><br />Karadzic has previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/karadzic-refuses-to-enter-plea-on-war.php">refused to enter pleas</a> [JURIST report], with the judge issuing not guilty pleas on his behalf. Karadzic faces 11 charges including genocide, murder, persecution, deportation, and &quot;other inhumane acts,&quot; for war crimes allegedly committed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war, including the 1995 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/675945.stm">Srebrenica massacre</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">news archive</a>].

Judges from the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Court of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] have ordered the lawyers to remove nine documents from their trial website that may compromise the confidentiality of court proceedings. The documents in question relate to defense requests to add Ieng Sary&#39;s medical and psychiatric health information to the trial record. The defense had previously refused to follow court orders, alleging that the co-investigating Judges, You Benleng and Marcel Lemonde had:<blockquote>suppress[ed] Defence [sic] filings which may be embarrassing or which call into question the legitimacy and judiciousness of the judges, all under the fig leaf that these are necessary measures to protect the supposed confidentiality and integrity of the investigation or judicial decision-making process.</blockquote>In response, the court said that the material being published was confidential, and defense counsel could not &quot;determine unilaterally which documents may be made public&quot; but must seek court approval before proceeding or face sanctions. <br /><br />Previously, Ieng Saray, who has been battling <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/khmer-rouge-war-crimes-suspect-back-in.php">health problems</a> [JURIST report], had argued that the tribunal was unfair, as he had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/cambodia-ex-khmer-rouge-official.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report; NYT <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE1DE113AF93BA2575AC0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1">report</a>] for his crimes by King Norodom Sihanouk on similar charges in 1996 and had appealed his detention citing <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/khmer-rouge-ex-officials-appeal.php">poor health</a> [JURIST report]. The ECCC has been plagued with <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-warns-cambodia-khmer-rouge.php">credibility</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cambodia-war-crimes-court-unable-to-pay.php">financial</a> [JURIST reports] problems since its inception. Last July, the UN cut off funding for the court, forcing it to rely on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/japan-promises-more-aid-to-cambodia.php">international donations</a> despite a recent <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eccc-cleared-of-mismanaging-funds-in.php">audit</a> [JURIST reports] that cleared it of accusations that it mismanaged funds.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Zimbabwe <a href="http://www.justice.gov.zw/departments/supreme%20court%20and%20masterregistrar/supreme.htm">High Court</a> [official website] ruled on Wednesday that the <a href="http://www.sadc.int/tribunal/">Southern Africa Development Community Tribunal</a> (SADC Tribunal) [official website] is not superior to the courts of the individual SADC member countries, in a decision invalidating a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/africa-regional-court-rules-white.php">SADC Tribunal ruling</a> [JURIST report] in favor of white Zimbabwe farmers whose lands were expropriated by a government land reform program. The case was brought to the High Court by white farmer Richard Etheredge, seeking to enforce the SADC ruling to evict the land reform beneficiary who received his farm, President of the Senate Edna Madzongwe. The judge <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200903040070.html">reasoned</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span> report] that although Zimbabwe signed the <a href="http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/african/docs/other/sadc6.doc">SADC Treaty</a> [text, doc] that established the court, the treaty does not expressly state that the tribunal is to be considered the superior court for all member states. White Zimbabwe farmers continue to endure pressure to leave their lands, according to <a href="http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/3512">reports</a> [Sokwanele report, VOA <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-02-10-voa23.cfm">report</a>]. <br /><br />In December 2008, four white Zimbabwe farmers were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-defies-regional-court-charges.php">charged with trespassing</a> [JURIST report] on state property for failing to vacate lands that the government seized for the land reform program, in open defiance of the November 2008 SADC Tribunal ruling. Among them, Colin Cloete has filed suit to cause the government and attorney general to register the SADC ruling in the High Court Registry, a step necessary to enable its enforcement in the country. Government officials have expressed that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/zimbabwe-government-to-ignore-african.php">land reform program is necessary</a> [JURIST report] to correct past racial disparities that favored the white farmers, and the land reform program will continue.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/06-1249.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 6-3 Wednesday in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/06-1249">Wyeth v. Levine</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-hears-drug-labeling-free.php">report</a>] that the drug labeling requirements under the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact1.htm">Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act</a> (FDCA) [text] do not preempt state products liability laws. The case was initiated by a Vermont woman who brought a negligence and failure-to-warn products liability suit against pharmaceutical company <a href="http://www.wyeth.com/">Wyeth</a> [corporate website], arguing that the company&#39;s failure to indicate the dangers of intravenously injected migraine and anti-nausea drug Phenergan eventually led to the amputation of her arm. Wyeth argued that any state-requested changes to the drug label would have violated <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] requirements because FDA approval is based partly on the label, and that allowing state-requested changes to drug labels would contradict legislative intent by allowing an agency other than the FDA officially to determine drug safety. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens said that a drug manufacturer and not the FDA bears primary responsibility for product labeling, and that a manufacturer may itself initiate strengthened warning labels to comply with state and federal requirements. Stevens concluded that: <blockquote>If Congress thought state-law suits posed an obstacle to its objectives, it surely would have enacted an express preemption provision at some point during the FDCA&#39;s 70-year history. ... Its silence on the issue, coupled with its certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation, is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend FDA oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness.</blockquote>The decision upholds the Vermont Supreme Court <a href="http://libraries.vermont.gov/sites/libraries/files/supct/current/op2004-384.txt">affirmance</a> [opinion text] of a $6.7 million jury award for the plaintiff.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudan and other African countries on Wednesday criticized the  <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for issuing an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639078.pdf">arrest warrant</a> [text, PDF; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/0EF62173-05ED-403A-80C8-F15EE1D25BB3.htm">release</a>] for Sudanese President <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/29B42DAB-BF84-476F-9C8B-5515B3B731D6/279931/CISAlBashirEn.pdf">Omar al-Bashir</a> [ICC materials, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>], while Sudan&#39;s opposition leaders, the UN, and various Western countries urged Bashir&#39;s government to cooperate with court. In Sudan, Information and Communication Minister Kamal Ebeid <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/05/content_10944769.htm">rejected</a> [Xinhua report] the court&#39;s authority to issue the warrant, thousands protested in Darfur, and several aid agencies were expelled from the country. Spokesmen for both the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/">African Union</a> [official website] and Egypt warned that the warrant could disrupt peacekeeping efforts in the country, but Sudan opposition SPLM Party member Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth said that actions by the ICC <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/Africa/2009-03-04-voa46.cfm">should not interfere</a> [VOA report] with country&#39;s <a href="http://www.unmis.org/English/cpa.htm">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> (CPA) [UN backgrounder]. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] urged Sudan to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=3731">cooperate with the court</a> [press release] and said that UN peacekeepers would remain in the country. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] said that the US supported peace in Sudan and that those responsible for atrocities there <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/03/119992.htm">should be held accountable</a> [press release].<br /><br />The warrant for Bashir, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639096.pdf">issued</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">report</a>] earlier on Wednesday, charged him with seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but did not include genocide charges. The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir+warrant">controversial arrest warrant</a> [JURIST news archive] had been sought by ICC prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile], who in July filed preliminary <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc559999.pdf">charges</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">report</a>] against Bashir alleging genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed in the Darfur region in violation of Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]. The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-to-rule-on-bashir-arrest-warrant.php">announced last week</a> [JURIST report] that they would decide whether to issue an arrest warrant on Wednesday. The announcement came after the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/africa/12hague.html">reported</a> [NYT report] last month that the warrant had been issued, leading a court official quickly to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-denies-reports-that-bashir-arrest.php">issue a denial</a> [JURIST report].

Leahy <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3686&wit_id=2629">said a nonpartisan inquiry</a> [statement] &quot;could focus on the issues of national security and executive power in the government&#39;s counterterrorism efforts, including the issues of cruel interrogation, extraordinary rendition, and executive override of laws.&quot; Leahy said a commission would not be focused on preparing criminal indictments, but it should have subpoena powers.

Leahy <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/dsm-leahy-schedules-truth-hearing-on.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the hearing in February, saying the panel&#39;s primary focus would be <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=us+torture">interrogation tactics</a>, <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/rendition.php">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive], and Bush&#39;s broad use of executive authority.

Khodorkovsky and his former business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website] are facing <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">new charges</a> [JURIST report] of embezzling and laundering nearly $20 billion during their tenures at the Russian energy firm <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901040719-662739,00.html">OAO Yukos Oil Co.</a> [TIME backgrounder]. During Tuesday&#39;s proceedings, the Moscow court <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/600/42/375001.htm">rejected a request</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] by Khodorkovsky&#39;s lawyers to remove two Russian state prosecutors who were involved in his <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/russian-oil-magnate-guilty-on-six.php">2005 trial</a> [JURIST report] for fraud and tax evasion. The court also rejected a defense request to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/world/europe/04moscow.html?ref=world">move Khodorkovsky</a> [NYT report] from the glass and steel enclosure where defendants are normally kept, which many Russian lawyers believe violates international law. Khodorkovsky&#39;s lawyers have said that they believe his trial will last for <a href="http://www.interfax.com/3/476144/news.aspx">more than six months</a> [Interfax report].<br /><br />Critics have claimed that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are politically motivated due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition of former Russian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST news archive]. The transfer of the two from prison to Moscow to stand trial on the new charges was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/khodorkovsky-to-face-new-trial-as.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] two weeks ago by a judge for the District Court in Moscow. Khodorkovsky is currently serving an eight-year sentence for his 2005 conviction on the fraud and tax evasion charges, although he maintains his innocence. He <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-yukos-oil-executive-applies-for.php">requested early release</a> last July, but his application was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russian-court-denies-early-release-for.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] in August because he disobeyed guards at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/25/russia.tomparfitt">Krasnokamensk penal colony</a> [Guardian backgrounder], refused to participate in a training program, and faced the possibility of additional charges. Khodorkovsky has <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khodorkovsky-appeals-parole-rejection.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] that decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of Massachusetts plaintiffs who are or have been married under the state&#39;s <a href="http://http//jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] law filed a <a href="http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-complaint-03-03-09.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF; GLAD <a href="http://www.glad.org/current/news-detail/glad-files-suit-challenging-doma-section-3/">press release</a>] against the US federal government Tuesday in the US <a href="http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website], challenging the federal <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text]. The plaintiffs in the suit, which was filed against the <a href="http://www.opm.gov/">Office of Personnel Management</a> (OPM), <a href="http://www.usps.com/about/welcome.htm?from=home_header&page=aboutuspsandnews">United States Postal Service</a> (USPS) [official websites], and other departments and officials of the US federal government, are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as review of a number of agency actions. The lawsuit is a direct challenge to DOMA, which the plaintiffs claim violates their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] right to equal protection as it applies to several federal laws and administrative rules. The lawsuit also asks the court to declare DOMA unconstitutional, and &quot;enjoin the defendants from continuing to discriminate against the plaintiffs by treating them differently from similarly situated individuals who are married to persons of the opposite sex.&quot; In the compliant, the plaintiffs argue that DOMA:<blockquote>as applied to plaintiffs, violates the United States Constitution by refusing to recognize lawful marriages for purposes of the laws governing benefits for federal employees and retirees, the Internal Revenue Code, the Social Security laws and the laws and regulations governing issuance of passports. The result of these violations of the Constitution is that each of the plaintiffs has been denied, and will continue to be denied, legal protections and benefits under federal law that would be available to them if their spouses were of the opposite sex.</blockquote>The lawsuit has received support from several public officials, including Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=cagopressrelease&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Cago&b=pressrelease&f=2009_03_03_doma_glad_statement&csid=Cago">Attorney General Martha Coakley</a> [AG press release] and US <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/03/kerry_backs_law.html">Senator John Kerry</a> [Boston.com report].<br /><br />The plaintiffs in the lawsuit are represented by <a href="http://www.glad.org/">Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders</a> (GLAD) [advocacy website], the same organization that represented the lead plaintiffs in <a href="http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/goodridge_decision.pdf">Goodridge v. Department of Public Health</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">report</a>], in which the Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/">Supreme Judicial Court</a> (SJC) [official website] legalized same-sex marriage. The lawsuit comes amidst a number of legal developments regarding marriage between same-sex couples. Earlier this month, a New Jersey judge <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-jersey-judge-grants-divorce-to-same.php">granted a divorce</a> [JURIST report] to a same-sex couple who had married in Canada. In early February, a New York court ruled that the surviving spouse of a same-sex marriage performed in Canada was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-york-court-rules-same-sex-surviving.php">entitled to inherit</a> [JURIST report] the estate of the deceased spouse. The judge in that case found no legal basis to treat the marriage between two men differently than heterosexual marriages performed in other countries or states. Also in February, the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that in March it <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/california-supreme-court-to-hear.php">will hear oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in three cases challenging the constitutionality of <a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm">Proposition 8</a> [materials], the ballot measure <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed in November</a> [JURIST report] that banned same-sex marriage in California. In November 2008, a <a href="http://www.jud.state.ct.us/external/supapp/default.htm">Connecticut Supreme Court</a> [official website] judge <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/connecticut-judge-signs-off-on-same-sex.php">signed a final order</a> [JURIST report] allowing same-sex marriage in the state, a month after that court <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] state statutes barring same-sex marriage as violations of the Connecticut state constitution because they discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Federal Constitutional Court of Germany</a> [official website, in German] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/cs20090303_2bvc000307.html">ruled</a> [decision, in German; <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/pressemitteilungen/bvg09-019en.html">press release</a>] that the use of electronic voting machines in elections is unconstitutional. The ruling comes after a challenge to the use of the machines in the 2005 Bundestag election. Plaintiffs had <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4069101,00.html">argued</a> [DW report] that electronically counted votes could easily be tampered with. In reaching their decision, the court acknowledged the potential for fraud and electronic errors, and further examined the protection of voter rights, ruling that voters must be able to know that their votes will be accurately counted. Although the court did not ban the use of all voting machines, only ones that did not comply with constitutional standards, the decision will likely <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/03/03/europe/EU-Germany-Voting-Machines.php">jeopardize</a> [AP report] the use of electronic voting machines in future elections.<br /><br />Electronic voting has faced constitutional controversy in the US for several years. In September, a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/georgia-judge-dismisses-electronic.php">Georgia court granted summary judgment</a> [JURIST report] to the State of Georgia against a state constitutional challenge to the use of electronic voting machines. Similar challenges in <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/voting-activists-appeal-maryland-e.htm">Maryland</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/nj-judge-rejects-electronic-voting.php">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2004/10/federal-judge-rules-no-paper-trail.php">Florida</a> [JURIST reports] to the legality of paper-free voting systems have also been unsuccessful. In December 2006, a <a href="http://vote.nist.gov/DraftWhitePaperOnSIinVVSG2007-20061120.pdf">draft report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/federal-report-says-paperless.php">report</a>] from the US <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) [official website] and the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">Election Assistance Commission</a> (EAC) [official website] concluded that software-dependent electronic voting machines &quot;are not viable for future voting systems&quot; and &quot;in practical terms cannot be made secure.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US is resuming active participation as an observer in the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website, JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/unhumanrightscouncil.php">news archive</a>], according to interim Charge d&#39;Affaires to the US Mission in Geneva <a href="http://geneva.usmission.gov/BIOS/MarkStorellaText.html">Mark Sorella</a> [official profile] in his <a href="http://geneva.usmission.gov/Press2009/0304StorellaHRC.html">address</a> [statement text] to the council Wednesday. Sorella said that the US is committed &quot;to work alongside all those working in good faith to promote and protect the human rights of every person around the world.&quot; Sorella also emphasized that:<blockquote>the United States remains concerned about the politicization of human rights, and about this Council&#8217;s repeated singling out of one country. We are concerned about this Council&#8217;s failure thus far to address some of the most egregious human rights violations in the world today, and about isolated but alarming attempts by some to use Council resolutions to undermine universal human rights, such as freedom of expression. We call on all in this chamber to recommit to advancing human rights for all &#8211; and to end the politicization of this effort.</blockquote>The US <a href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hgpsBLTUnkb_JOew-lLqYNzL94KA">withdrew from participation</a> [AFP report, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/06/05/us-leaving-un-rights-council-fails-victims-abuse">report</a>] in June 2008, citing discontentment with the council&#39;s record during its first two years in confronting abuses and alleging Council unilateral bias against Israel. The US has declined to run for a seat since the UNHRC commenced operations. <br /><br />Last week, the US <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/27/AR2009022702826.html">threatened to boycott</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/durbanreview2009/">UN Durban Review Conference on racism</a> [official website] to take place in April, as long as the conference is based on the current outcome document draft that the US alleges is biased against Israel. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/02/119892.htm">refuses to continue negotiations</a> [press release] on the document that the Department of State believes &quot;must not single out any one country or conflict, nor embrace the troubling concept of &#39;defamation of religion&#39; [and] ... should not go further than the DDPA on the issue of reparations for slavery.&quot; Last month, the US representatives remained silent during the UNHRC <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRMain.aspx">Universal Periodic Review</a> (UPR) [materials] of potential rights abuses. State Department spokesperson Robert Wood <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2009/02/116495.htm">defended the silence of the US delegates</a> [press conference transcript; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-defends-silence.php">report</a>] during the UPR, saying that the US was not actively participating because the administration of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] was still deciding how it wanted to interact with the council.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] should take steps to improve the enforcement of international justice, according to a <a href="http://www.aegistrust.org/images/PDFs/enforcement_of_international_criminal_law.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.aegistrust.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=803&Itemid=88">press release</a>] issued Tuesday by <a href="http://www.aegistrust.org/index.php">Aegis Trust</a> [advocacy website], an advocacy group dedicated to eliminating genocide. The report, entitled &quot;The Enforcement of Criminal Law,&quot; proposes reforms that would improve enforcement, including:<blockquote>pooled financing, specialist units, a new treaty on crimes against humanity, an optional protocol to the Genocide Convention, and an increased role for the ICC in catalyzing domestic convictions, ... [suggesting that] the plumbing of international justice requires much more work than the architecture.</blockquote>Highlights in the report also made reference to a changing US policy as demonstrated by recent offers from the Department of State to work with the ICC prosecutor on shared interests, as well as to Africa&#39;s mixed record. Finally, the report recognized the important results that have come from the efforts of non-governmental organizations. <br /><br />The report&#39;s release coincides with the eve of the ICC&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-to-rule-on-bashir-arrest-warrant.php">decision on whether to issue an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Sudanese President <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3273569.stm">Omar Al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>]. ICC Chief Prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] sought the warrant in <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for.php">July 2008</a> [JURIST report], accusing Al-Bashir of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes allegedly being committed in the Darfur region. Moreno-Ocampo made <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7921212.stm">statements during a press conference</a> [BBC report] in The Hague on Tuesday that among the very strong evidence documenting how Al-Bashir controlled and managed everything, the prosecution has 30 witnesses who are under protection. Al-Bashir has said that he and his government will <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/03/20093314248171925.html">disregard any ICC decision</a> [AlJazeera report], despite <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-sg-urges-bashir-to-comply-with.php">calls from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [JURIST report] in early February urging Al-Bashir to cooperate with any decision issued by the ICC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-03-09.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb09.shtml#caperton">briefs</a>] in two criminal procedure cases Wednesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-192.pdf">Abuelhawa v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] the Court heard arguments on whether a defendant who used a cellphone for the misdemeanor purchase of cocaine can be charged with a felony for using a &quot;communication facility&quot; to facilitate the distribution of an illegal drug under <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/843.html">21 USC &sect; 843(b)</a> [text]. The defendant argues that the provision should only apply to distributors of the drugs and not who purchase them for personal use. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed, <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/074639.P.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] that the defendant could be charged with a felony. At oral argument, counsel for the defendant argued:<blockquote>A person who purchases a small quantity of drugs for his own personal use commits a misdemeanor, not a felony. The language of section 843(b) does not transform that person into a felon if he uses a phone in obtaining his drugs, rather than doing so strictly face to face.</blockquote>Counsel for the government argued:<blockquote>Section 843(b) prohibits the use of a communication facility in causing or facilitating the commission of any act constituting a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. The court of appeals correctly held that the statute is violated when a person uses a communication facility such as a telephone to purchase controlled substances unlawfully. A call to order drugs both causes and facilitates a felony distribution of drugs.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-5274.pdf">Dean v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], the Court heard arguments on whether the accidental discharge of a firearm during the commission of a felony crime subjects a defendant to a 10-year minimum sentence for the crime. Under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/924.html">18 USC 924(c)(1)(A)(iii)</a> [text], the increased sentence attaches when a firearm is discharged, but the defendant argued that there must also be some showing that the discharge was intentional. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200614918.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the defendant should be subjected to the 10-year minimum sentence requirement.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] acknowledged Monday that the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF] 92 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes of terrorism suspect interrogations</a> [JURIST news archive]. The acknowledgment came in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information. A stay on that order  expired last week, and in a letter to the court, US Attorney Peter Skinner wrote that the DOJ now intends to provide as much of the information as possible, as well as justifications for omissions. The court seeks descriptions of the destroyed tapes; any ancillary summaries, transcripts, or reconstructions of their content; and the names of those individuals who had either viewed or possessed the tapes. Skinner requested that the DOJ be given until March 6 to provide the court with a schedule under which it can provide the information.<br /><br />The August 2008 order came in response to a December 2007 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU)&nbsp;[advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/aclu_v_dod_memo_contemptmotion.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA be held in contempt of court for not providing information on the tapes during a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/torturefoia.html">lawsuit</a> [ACLU materials] brought by the organization in an effort to access government materials on the interrogations. The DOJ is also conducting a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/doj-opens-criminal-probe-into-cia.php">criminal probe</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] into the destruction of the tapes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-03-09.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/feb09.shtml#caperton">briefs</a>] in two cases on Tuesday. In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-22.pdf">Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Company</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] the Court heard arguments on whether they should adopt a constitutional standard for requiring state judges to recuse themselves in cases where there is an &quot;appearance of bias.&quot; The case is on appeal from a <a href="http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/docs/spring08/33350R.pdf">case</a> [opinion, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/">Supreme Court of Appeals West Virginia</a> [official website] where <a href="http://www.masseyenergyco.com/">A.T. Massey</a> [corporate website] sought to reverse a $50 million verdict against them. Caperton, the plaintiff in that case, argues that because then-Acting Justice Brent Benjamin received $3 million in campaign contributions from A.T. Massey, he should have recused himself, and that his failure to do so was a violation of the Due Process clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxiv.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]:<blockquote>When the circumstances, including the timing of the contribution, the magnitude and proportion of the contribution, are such that it would lead a reasonable person in possession of all of the facts - these are all words from these courts&#39; decisions - to believe that the judge would have a difficult time being other than biased in favor of one of the parties, that would be the standard that would be applied.</blockquote>Massey argued that the imposition of a federal standard for state court recusal would be outside the reach of the Due Process clause.<blockquote>[W]e&#39;re talking about appearance as distinct from actual bias or probable [bias.] I can understand a rule that says the probability of bias is enough. I think it would be a very ill-advised rule without historical foundation, without foundation in the Court&#39;s precedents, and open-ended and creating all kinds of problems; but I can understand that rule. That at least is addressed to the right of the party to get a fair trial.<br /><br />Appearance is addressed to a different thing. It&#39;s addressed to the reputation of the judicial system, which is not, I think, the function of the Due Process Clause to address.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-146.pdf">Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF] the Court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=29568">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text] gives federal appeals courts jurisdiction to rule on the denial of compelled arbitration motions. <a href="http://www.andersen.com/">Arthur Andersen</a> [corporate website] sought to stay the proceedings of a suit brought by Carlisle alleging misconduct in a tax shelter scheme, on the grounds that another party to the suit had an arbitration agreement with the plaintiffs, and that equitable estoppel required that their claims also be arbitrated under that agreement, contrary to the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0148p-06.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit:<blockquote>Respondents&#39; theory of the case would wipe out 60 years of FAA case law recognizing that nonparties have arbitration rights. Theories such as third party beneficiary, assignment, agency, estoppel, including equitable estoppel, assumption, successor in interest, none of those cases can survive effectively if this Court were to affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit.</blockquote>Carlisle responded that the section 3 of the FAA on which Arthur Andersen relies relates to &quot;contract-based arbitration obligations&quot;:<blockquote>Estoppel is what you invoke when you have no contract to invoke, and this version of equitable estoppel is what you invoke when you have no arbitration agreement to invoke.</blockquote>The case stems from an effort by Arthur Andersen and other firms to limit the tax exposure of Carlisle and his business associates after the sale of their construction company. Carlisle had signed an arbitration agreement with Bricolage Capital LLC, one of the firms involved in the &quot;leveraged option strategy&quot; intended as a tax shelter. The IRS declared this strategy to be an abusive shelter, and assessed more than $25 million against Carlisle and his associates.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/index.shtml">New York State Supreme Court Appellate Division</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/calendar/appsmots/2009/March/2009_03_03_dec.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that the parents of a 23 year-old, who donated semen prior to his death from cancer in 1998, were not entitled to possession of the specimens. Mary and Antonio Speranza sought their son Mark&#39;s semen specimens, which he donated in 1997 so that he could have children after if he survived his battle with cancer, from <a href="http://www.reprolabinc.com/">Repro Lab, Inc.</a> [corporate website] in order to have a grandchild. The court relied on regulations from the <a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/">New York State Department of Health</a> [official website] in its ruling, finding that Mark was considered a &quot;directed donor&quot; under New York law. As a result, Speranza was only entitled to direct his semen to a specific recipient, and had chosen to have his semen destroyed upon his death. Mark&#39;s parents argued that they had not had the opportunity to perform discovery and that the contract between Mark and Repro Lab had been violated. The court found:<blockquote>Also implicit in plaintiffs&#39; presentation is the suggestion that the balance of the equities weighs in their favor. However, although plaintiffs&#39; plight elicits sympathy, we can find no legal basis for allowing the ultimate relief plaintiffs seek, and there are substantial grounds upon which it must be denied. Although as between the parties, defendant will not be harmed if plaintiffs prevail, other broader interests preclude giving plaintiffs possession of the specimens for purposes of engendering Mark&#39;s biological child, their grandchild, with the sperm he left behind.</blockquote>The case was one of first impression, and the Speranzas are still considering a possible appeal. Repro Lab has agreed to keep the semen specimens until the Speranzas have decided to no longer appeal.<br /><br />The appeal came as a result of the decision by New York State Supreme Court judge Jane Solomon in January 2007. Solomon had initially <a href="http://decisions.courts.state.ny.us/fcas/FCAS_docs/2006OCT/30040053220061SCIV.PDF">denied the motion</a> [opinion; PDF] for preliminary injunction and declared the Speranzas had no legal right to semen specimens because they were not part of Mark&#39;s estate in October 2006. The Speranzas requested that Repro Lab keep Mark&#39;s semen as they looked for a potential surrogate following his death in 1998. Repro Lab agreed to do so as long as the monthly storage fees were paid.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A court under the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?id=1">European Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EULEX">news archive</a>] reached its first <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?id=8&n=73">verdict</a> [EULEX report] Tuesday, sentencing Kosovo Albanian Gani Gashi to 17 years in jail for murder, attempted murder, and grievous bodily harm. A three-judge panel, composed of two EULEX judges and a judge from Kosovo, <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2009/03/04/europe/OUKWD-UK-KOSOVO-WARCRIMES.php">found Gashi guilty</a> [Reuters report] of crimes committed during the Kosovo-Serbian conflict in 1998-1999. The sentence is a <a href="http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2009&mm=03&dd=04&nav_id=57581">milestone</a> [B92 report] for the EULEX court, which is charged with aiding the restoration of the rule of law in Kosovo. In a statement issued by Chief EULEX prosecutor Theo Jacobs, the verdict was heralded as symbolic for the future of the EULEX court in Kosovo: &quot;This trial shows that EULEX is serious about investigating and prosecuting war crimes cases whenever they took place, as long as we have enough evidence for a successful prosecution to proceed.&quot;<br /><br />The court has had a difficult beginning since the EULEX <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/eu-kosovo-rule-of-law-mission-begins.php">formally began operations</a> [JURIST report] in December. On Tuesday, the trial of two Serbian defendants was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/first-eu-kosovo-trial-blocked-by.php">derailed</a> [JURIST report] by hundreds of Serbian protesters and postponed indefinitely. Kosovo controversially <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/kosovo-parliament-adopts-declaration-of.php">seceded from Serbia</a> [JURIST report] in February 2008, and its new <a href="http://www.kushtetutakosoves.info/?cid=2,246">constitution</a> [text] <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/kosovo-constitution-goes-into-force.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] in June. Kosovo&#39;s Declaration of Independence from Serbia was met with support from the EU, the US, and from many other countries. Serbia <a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/MUMA-7BU3QJ?OpenDocument">formally condemned the secession</a> [text, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/serbia-denounces-expected-kosovo.php">report</a>], citing its illegality under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999).

The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir+warrant">controversial arrest warrant</a> [JURIST news archive] had been sought by ICC prosecutor <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile], who in July filed preliminary <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc559999.pdf">charges</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/icc-prosecutor-applies-for-warrant-to.php">report</a>] against al-Bashir alleging genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed in the Darfur region in violation of Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text]. This is the first time the ICC has issued an arrest warrant against a sitting head of state.<br /><br />The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-to-rule-on-bashir-arrest-warrant.php">announced last week</a> [JURIST report] that they would decide whether to issue an arrest warrant on Wednesday. The announcement came after the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/africa/12hague.html">reported</a> [NYT report] last month that the warrant had been issued, leading a court official quickly to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-denies-reports-that-bashir-arrest.php">issue a denial</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] on Thursday held a <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/d0cf6618525a9efb85257359003fb69d/fb91adcf9207192c8525756e00628f69">hearing</a> [press release] to reconsider California&#39;s <a href="http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/ca-waiver.htm">request to regulate automobile greenhouse gases</a> [materials]. Chairwoman of the <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">California Air Resources Board</a> [official website] Mary Nichols <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/EPA-urged-to-reverse-Bushera-apf-14558593.html">was joined by environmental groups and other state officials</a> [AP report] at the hearing to encourage the EPA to reverse its prior <a href="http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-AIR/2008/March/Day-06/a4350.htm">decision</a> [text] denying California&#39;s request. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia seek to adopt standards similar to California&#39;s. The <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+42USC7543">Clean Air Act provisions on state standards</a> [text] prohibit states from &quot;adopt[ing] or attempt[ing] to enforce any standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.&quot; However, a state can obtain a waiver for exemption from this policy following a public hearing &quot;if the State determines that the State standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards.&quot; No such waiver will be issued if the EPA finds that &quot;the determination of the State is arbitrary and capricious,&quot; &quot;such State does not need such State standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions,&quot; or that &quot;such State standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with&quot; <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+42USC7521">Section 202(a)</a> [text] of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/">Clean Air Act</a> [materials].<br /><br />California&#39;s request was initially denied in March 2008 on the grounds that California&#39;s regulations were aimed at addressing global climate change and that the Clean Air Act &quot;intended to allow California to promulgate state standards&quot; to &quot;address pollution problems that are local or regional.&quot; In January, President Barack Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Presidential_Memorandum_EPA_Waiver/">ordered</a> [memorandum; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-allows-california-and-other.php">report</a>] the EPA to reassess its 2008 holding. In May 2008, a report by the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform found that the Bush White House had <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/white-house-influenced-epa-in-emission.php">influenced the March 2008 decision</a> and that the administration later <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/white-house-claims-executive-privilege.php">refused to turn over requested documents</a> [JURIST reports] concerning the decision to the committee, citing executive privilege. The 2007 Supreme Court decision of <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1120.pdf">Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [decision, PDF] held that the EPA has the authority to regulate automobile greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]&nbsp;The <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/">Sri Lankan government</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sri+lanka">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.ltteps.org/">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [group website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">news archive</a>] should <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/04/sri-lanka-urgently-evacuate-civilians">agree on an evacuation plan for civilians</a> [press release] caught in hostilities between the groups in the country&#39;s Vanni region, according to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a>&nbsp;(HRW) [advocacy website] Wednesday. HRW said that approximately 150,000&nbsp;civilians&nbsp;are caught in the area, and that more than 2,000 have been killed in the last two months. Also Wednesday,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a>&nbsp;(ICRC) [advocacy website]&nbsp;head of South Asian operations&nbsp;Jaques de Maio said the situation in the country was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/sri-lanka-interview-040309?opendocument">dire</a>&nbsp;[interview text]: <blockquote>[I]t is definitely one of the most disastrous situations I have come across. Yet it would be possible to avoid further unnecessary suffering and death by allowing civilians who want to leave to get out of the area. It is urgent that more humanitarian assistance be brought into the Vanni now.<br /></blockquote>Maio said that the ICRC had already been able to evacuate approximately 2,400 sick and wounded civilians from Vanni over the last three weeks with some cooperation from of the government and LTTE, but said that the&nbsp;evacuations&nbsp;have still been dangerous and that the fighting has destroyed hospitals and other&nbsp;infrastructure.<br /><br />Last month, HRW released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/srilanka0209web_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-accuses-sri-lanka-and.php">report</a>] alleging that both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE are guilty of human rights violations. Earlier this year, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=navi+pillay">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/7C48F59856B2A8BCC125754D003C5D24?opendocument">issued a statement</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] condemning the deteriorating conditions of those trapped in the Vanni region, and called for investigations and prosecutions for the killings and other human rights abuses. HRW has repeatedly accused both sides of violations, and since 2007 has also criticized the government&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sri-lanka-should-halt-internment-of.php">de facto internment centers</a> and its role in the increase in <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/sri-lanka-government-rights-abuses-on.php">unlawful killings and other human rights violations</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/index.htm">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=5&portal=hbkm&action=html&highlight=&sessionid=20233469&skin=hudoc-en">ruled</a> [judgment text] Thursday that Russia is liable for the death of an ethnic Chechen at the hands of Russian forces in 2000, finding Russia in violation of the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. The judgment orders the Russian government to pay damages of nearly &#8364;37,000 to the victim&#39;s wife, a Russian national who brought the action after her <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20090305/120444104.html">husband was killed by Russian troops</a> [RIA Novosti report] while chopping wood. The ECHR found the killing violated Article 2 of the Convention, which protects the right to life and prohibits extrajudicial killing. The court also found that Russia violated Articles 2 and 13, which protect the right to an effective remedy before a national authority, when it failed &quot;to carry out an adequate and effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the applicant&#39;s husband.&quot;<br /><br />The ECHR has consistently ruled against Russia in cases involving human rights violations in Chechnya. In December, the ECHR ruled against Russia in <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/europe-court-orders-russia-to.php">six Chechen disappearances cases</a> [JURIST report], and ordered the country to pay &#8364;320,000 to the victims&#39; families. In October, the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">issued two decisions</a> [JURIST report] finding Russia in violation of the human rights convention in several cases concerning the deaths or abductions of Russian nationals in Chechnya in 2000. In May, the court ruled that Russia was responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/europe-rights-court-holds-russia.php">disappearance of a dozen people</a> [JURIST report] during Russian armed raids in Chechnya in 2002 and 2003. In July 2007, the court ruled that Russian authorities were responsible for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/echr-rules-russia-responsible-for.php">shooting deaths of 11 unarmed Chechen civilians</a>, and in June 2007 it held that Russian authorities were liable for the <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/russia-responsible-for-chechen-deaths.php">2003 deaths of four Chechen family members</a> [JURIST reports]. In early December 2008, Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/news_detale.php?id=5559">proposed</a> [transcript, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/russia-president-calls-for-judicial.php">report</a>] that Russian courts become more transparent in order to restore faith in the justice system and prevent people from turning to the ECHR.

The agreement between the previous administration and chairman of the committee <a href="http://conyers.house.gov/">John Conyers, Jr.</a> (D-MI) [official website], follows a <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/files/Miers%20Bolton%20opinion_0.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-judge-rejects-white-house.php">report</a>] by US District Judge John Bates which rejected the administration&#39;s position that senior White House officials are protected from congressional subpoena by executive privilege. The committee also said that it has reserved the right to depose former White House lawyer William Kelley, who was involved in firings. Many members of Congress applauded the agreement, including Speaker of the House <a href="http://speaker.house.gov/">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-CA) [official website] who <a href="http://speaker.house.gov/newsroom/pressreleases?id=1034">said</a> [press release], &quot;the agreement for Karl Rove and Harriet Miers to testify upholds a fundamental principle: no one is above the law and Congressional subpoenas must be complied with.&quot;<br /><br />In July, Rove <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/rove-defies-subpoena-to-testify-on-doj.php">refused to testify</a> [JURIST report] before the House Judiciary Committee in defiance of a subpoena during the committee&#39;s investigation into politicization of the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. In March 2008, the House Judiciary Committee filed a lawsuit to enforce subpoenas seeking information from Miers and former White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolton regarding the firings. In 2007, Rove <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/rove-fails-to-appear-at-senate.php">refused to testify</a> [JURIST report] before a scheduled hearing of the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] in regards to the 2006-2007 attorney firings. The Bush administration had asserted executive privilege in allowing Miers, Bolton, and Rove to withhold testimony.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ctd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the District of Connecticut</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/pdf/abujihaadhassan.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a former Navy signalman&#39;s conviction for material support of terrorism. Judge Mark Kravitz set aside the conviction of Hassan Abu-Jihaad, finding that the facts of the case did not support the jury&#39;s determination that Abu-Jihaad had provided either &quot;physical assets&quot; or &quot;personnel&quot; within the meaning of <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002339---A000-.html">18 USC &sect; 2339A</a> [text].<blockquote>It could well be that Mr. Abu-Jihaad asked Azzam how he could help in supporting jihad, they told him to send defense information ... and Mr. Abu-jihhad did as requested. In those circumstances, the Court would have little difficulty concluding that Mr. Abu- Jihaad had volunteered himself as personnel .... On the other hand, perhaps Mr. Abu-Jihaad on a whim simply sent defense information to Azzam on one occasion, not knowing if Azzam wanted it .... In those circumstances, he surely provided defense information to someone not entitled to receive it, ... but it would be linguistically odd to describe that lone, voluntary act as making personnel available to Azzam.</blockquote>Kravitz upheld Abu-Jihaad&#39;s conviction on charges of disclosing classified national defense information to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1823045.stm">Azzam Publications</a> [BBC backgrounder], a suspected terrorist support network.<br /><br />Abu-Jihaad, formerly a signalman on the <a href="http://www.benfold.navy.mil/default.aspx">USS Benfold</a> [official website], was <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2008/20080305.html">convicted</a> [DOJ press release] last year when a document describing the movements, armaments and formation of the <a href="http://www.cusnc.navy.mil/">Fifth Fleet Battle Group</a> [official website] was discovered by British authorities during an investigation into suspected terrorist <a href="http://www.freebabarahmad.com/">Babar Ahmad</a> [advocacy website; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4441680.stm">profile</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Organic grocer <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/company/index.php">Whole Foods Market</a> [corporate website] agreed to a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/adjpro/d9324/090306wfdo.pdf">settlement</a> [decision and order, PDF; FTC <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/adjpro/d9324/index.shtm">docket</a>] with the US <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] on Friday over its 2007 merger with rival grocer <a href="http://www.henrysmarkets.com/u/about/">Wild Oats Market</a> [corporate website]. If approved by the FTC Commissioners, the settlement will require Whole Foods to divest itself of approximately 32 store locations, including 13 operating stores and 19 closed locations, as well as all Wild Oats intellectual property, including the Wild Oats brand name and trademarks. In return, the FTC will stop its <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=FTC+Whole+Foods">legal attempts</a> [JURIST news archive] to block the merger. In a <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2009/03/wholefoods.shtm">press release</a> [text], the Acting Director of the FTC&#39;s Bureau of Competition David Wales said:<blockquote>Over the past two years we never wavered in our belief that Whole Foods&#8217; acquisition of Wild Oats was anticompetitive, and we were prepared to demonstrate in court the actual, real-world consumer harm that resulted from the transaction[.] The consent order announced today is a major win for consumers and is the result of the superb work done by all the FTC staff.</blockquote>In January, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-appeals-court-rejects-whole.php">rejected a complaint</a> [JURIST report] filed by Whole Foods seeking an injunction to bar the FTC from holding <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/adjpro/d9324/index.shtm">administrative proceedings</a> [FTC administrative docket] concerning the Wild Oats merger. Whole Foods and the FTC have been engaged in <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0710114/0710114.shtm">ongoing litigation</a> [FTC litigation docket] over the Whole Foods-Wild Oats merger since it occurred in 2007. In August 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-whole.php">refused to block the merger</a> [JURIST report], despite an appeal by the FTC. The court reviewed the case in July 2008 and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-appeals-court-orders.php">ordered the district court to reconsider</a> [JURIST report] the potential impacts of the merger on the market. The district court has not yet ruled on the matter.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Singaporean member of the<a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8948/"> Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jemaah+Islamiyah">news archive</a>] terrorist group admitted  his role in plotting the foiled 2001 attack of an Indonesian airport, while testifying at the trial of two Indonesian terrorist suspects in the South Jakarta District Court Thursday. Mohammad Hassan bin Saynudin said that in 2001, he and other JI operatives planned to hijack a flight from Bangkok and crash it into Singapore&#39;s Changi Airport, but the plan failed and he escaped to Indonesia. Saynudin, who has been in Indonesian custody since July for allegedly planning a failed terrorist attack in an Indonesian bar, has previously admitted his involvement in terrorist activities. Last month he told the court that he <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/SE%2BAsia/Story/STIStory_343348.html">met with Osama bin Laden</a>  [<span style="font-style:italic;">Straits Times</span>, report] and tried to recruit Indonesians for al Qaeda purposes. Saynudin&#39;s testimony came at the trial of JI members Anis Sugandi and Sukarso Abdillah, who have admitted to murder and plotting to kill Christian clergy in Indonesia. Saynudin has been charged in the same incident and faces life in prison in a separate trial. <br /><br />JI has been blamed for a series of terrorist attacks on westerners including the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/asia_pacific/2002/bali/default.stm">2002 Bali nightclub bombings</a> [BBC backgrounder], which killed 202 people.  Last  November, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/indonesia-ag-confirms-execution-of-3.php">three JI members were executed</a> [JURIST report] following convictions for their involvement in those bombings. Before their executions, the three men had called on Islamic militant groups to carry out retribution attacks, which resulted in stepped-up security in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta and a <a href="http://jakarta.usembassy.gov/consular/WMNov0908.htm">warning</a> [text] issued by the US embassy in Indonesia. Last April, an Indonesian court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/indonesia-judge-sentences-jemaah.php">convicted two JI leaders</a> [JURIST report] on terrorism charges and recognized JI as a terrorist organization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge at the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] on Thursday upheld the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/FortDixTrial/JuryVerdict.pdf">guilty verdicts</a> [text, PDF] reached by a jury against five men convicted of plotting to kill US soldiers at <a href="http://www.dix.army.mil/">Fort Dix</a> [official website]. The five men, Serdar Tatar, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, Dritan Duka, Eljvir Duka, and Shain Duka, were acquitted of attempted murder, but were <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/December/08-nsd-1142.html">convicted</a> [DOJ press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/five-men-found-guilty-in-fort-dix-plot.php">report</a>] in December 2008 of conspiracy to commit murder and weapons offenses. Lawyers for the five men appeared before the court Thursday to argue that the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/FortDixTrial/index.html">claims against their clients</a> [case materials] were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hpU78Fwu6-swpC3MuWomEA9WYcCQD96O0GMG0">not supported by the evidence</a> [AP report] presented, and asked the court to overturn the verdicts. The court denied the request, and upheld the jury verdicts. The defense had argued that there was no plot, but the government paid informants to get the accused to discuss one.<br /><br />Federal prosecutors maintained that although the men had no ties to any terrorist organization, they were inspired by al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and were planning an attack. The men face a sentence of up to life in prison. The five suspects were <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/six-arrested-for-plotting-attack-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007 for allegedly plotting to sneak onto the New Jersey military base and kill soldiers. They <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/fort-dix-plot-suspects-plead-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January 2008. Their <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/trial-begins-for-fort-dix-plot-suspects.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in October. Last March, an accomplice, Agron Abdullahu, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/fort-dix-plot-accomplice-sentenced-to.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to 20 months in prison after <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/fort-dix-plot-suspect-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges of conspiring to provide firearms and ammunitions to the other five men.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A panel of legal and medical experts headed by Spanish <a href="http://www.migualdad.es/index.htm">Minister of Equality Bibiano Aido</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Wednesday proposed <a href="http://www.migualdad.es/noticias/05.03.09_COMITE_IVE.htm">sweeping reforms</a> [press release, in Spanish] to Spain&#39;s current <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive] laws. The panel contends that women should have the right to choose to abort during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Where the fetus is malformed or where the mother faces serious health risks, the panel suggests the right to abort should extend for up to 22 weeks. In cases where extreme fetal malformation would likely prove incompatible with life, the panel recommends extending the right to abort beyond 22 weeks. The panel also suggests the necessity of lowering the legal age from 18 to 16. These reforms are in sharp contrast with the current law, established in 1985, which allows women over the age of 18 the right to abort only in cases of rape (up to 12 weeks), fetal malformation (up to 22 weeks), and serious health risks to the mother (at any stage). Aido issued a <a href="http://www.migualdad.es/noticias/pdf/05.03.09_INTERVENCION_MINISTRA_IVE.pdf">statement</a> [statement, PDF, in Spanish] in anticipation of public opposition to the reforms, urging society to view the law as a necessarily neutral guarantee of fairness to and protection of women in Spain. The <a href="http://www.prolifeworldcongress.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=1">Association for Families and Human Dignity</a> [profile, in Spanish], a pro-life advocacy group, has already expressed their view that adding a <a href="http://www.diariocritico.com/2009/Marzo/nacional/134510/ley-aborto-reforma-bibiana-aido.html">relaxation of the law would be harmful to women</a> [<em>Diariocritico</em> report, in Spanish] and would result in a spike of the number of abortions performed in the country.<br /><br />The panel was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-panel-to-consider-abortion-law.php">formed in September</a> [JURIST report] at the request of <a href="http://www.la-moncloa.es/Presidente/Biografia/default.htm">Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero</a> [official profile, in Spanish] as part of a series of social reforms including <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] and streamlined divorce proceedings. Since Aido&#39;s committee was formed, the conservative <a href="http://www.pp.es/">Popular Party</a> [official website, in Spanish] has repeatedly <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/PP/aborto/elpepuopi/20090220elpepiopi_6/Tes">expressed the opinion</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] that relaxed abortion laws would stand in opposition to <a href="http://www.gva.es/cidaj/pdf/constitucion.pdf">Article 15 of the Spanish Constitution</a> [text, in Spanish], which guarantees the right to life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghanistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30093&Cr=afghan&Cr1=">human rights progress has been thwarted</a> [UN News Centre report] by armed conflict, censorship, abuse of power, and violence against women, according to a <a href="http://www.unama-afg.org/docs/_UN-Docs1/UN-HCHR/09march05-Annual-Report-HCHR-%20ENG%205%20MARCH%202009.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] delivered Thursday to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile]. The report says that addressing these problems requires addressing poverty, and that the Afghan government has a responsibility to help national institutions protect human rights. Pillay&#39;s report recommends that Afghanistan&#39;s government create a human rights unit in the <a href="http://www.moj.gov.af/?lang=en">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] to combat poverty faced by groups burdened by discrimination. The government must also ensure an impartial judiciary and law-enforcement body, and promote open and peaceful elections, the report says. Under Afghanistan&#39;s <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/af00000_.html">constitution</a> [text], men and women have equal rights, but, according to the report, women are being prosecuted for acts Afghan law does not define as crimes: &quot;The Government is failing to adequately protect the rights of women in Afghanistan despite constitutional guarantees and its international obligations.&quot; Another <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/HC_Annual_report.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] Pillay presented to the council Thursday suggests that 2008&#39;s food crisis, prompted by high food costs in the US, combined with the current economic crisis to negatively impact human-rights situations globally.<br /><br />Afghanistan continues to receive criticism for its human rights record. Last week, the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] released its annual <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm">2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [DOS materials], <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">criticizing Afghanistan</a> [JURIST report] for its continued use of child labor. In November, Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/10F9676D151A22DCC12574FE0050D0B3?opendocument">urged</a> [press release] Afghan President Hamad Karzai to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-human-rights-chief-urges-end-to.php">put a stop to executions</a> [JURIST report] and join nations calling for a death penalty moratorium after five prisoners were executed over the course of four days. Last March, Chief Human Rights Officer Norah Niland of the <a href="http://www.unama-afg.org/">United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> [official website] called on the Afghan government to <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/afghanistan-must-do-more-to-stop-human.php">do more to protect human rights</a> [JURIST report] and see that human rights violators are brought to justice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iran&#39;s Islamic Revolutionary Court will seek <a href="http://www.interpol.int/">INTERPOL</a> [official website] arrest warrants for more than 100 Israelis on war crimes charges stemming from the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/2001/israel_and_the_palestinians/default.stm">conflict in Gaza</a> [BBC backgrounder], prosecutors said Thursday. Iran announced in December that it would <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/burningIssues/idUKTRE52029V20090301">establish a court to try Gaza war crimes suspects</a> [Reuters report] <span style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</span>. On Monday, a <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=87229&sectionid=351020101">report from Iranian state broadcaster Press TV</a> [text] revealed that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, and Defense Minister Ehud Barak were among 15 senior Israeli officials for whom Iran had sought arrest warrants under the <a href="http://www.interpol.int/public/icpo/legalmaterials/constitution/constitutiongenreg/constitution.asp">INTERPOL constitution</a> [Article 2 text] for charges including undue aggression, disproportionate use of military force, threatening world peace and security, crimes against humanity, and genocide. INTERPOL immediately <a href="http://www.interpol.int/Public/ICPO/PressReleases/PR2009/PR200914.asp">publicly denied</a> [press release] receiving any request from Iran to issue such warrants, noting that &quot;INTERPOL&#8217;s Constitution strictly prohibits the Organization from making &#8216;any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character.&#39;&quot; Iranian chief prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi said Thursday that the list now includes more than 100 Israeli suspects, and that Iran will soon deliver dossiers on each to INTERPOL. Iranian Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi <a href="http://english.irib.ir/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=19976&Itemid=100">called the trials an Islamic duty</a> [IRIB report]. INTERPOL reiterated Thursday that <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/Detail.aspx?id=87610&sectionid=351020101">no such warrant requests have been received</a> [Press TV report] from Iran.<br /><br />Several other investigations into the Gaza conflict are pending. In January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D78B7DAC697D3060C1257539003B5F3A?opendocument">called for an independent investigation</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-head-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] of possible war crimes and human rights violations in Gaza. <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is also <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/palestinian-leaders-urge-icc.php">attempting to gain jurisdiction over Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its actions in Gaza for alleged war crimes. Israel has already begun to consider <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/israel-pm-asks-justice-minister-to.php">defenses against possible war crimes charges</a>, partly based on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">accusations</a> [JURIST reports] that it used white phosphorus in a civilian area.

The two men are accused of illegally taking approximately $20 billion from Russian energy firm <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901040719-662739,00.html">OAO Yukos Oil Co.</a> [TIME backgrounder], but challenged the allegations, asserting that the evidence against them&nbsp;<a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090306/120458573.html">was insufficient</a>&nbsp;[RIA Novosti report]&nbsp;to sustain the prosecution. Their trial on the charges <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-khodorkovsky-trial-begins-in-moscow.php">began on Wednesday</a> [JURIST report] and their latest request comes one day after&nbsp;Judge Viktor Danilkin <a href="http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=28421">refused to recuse himself</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times</font> report] from the case amid accusations of bias.&nbsp;If found guilty, Khodorkovsky could face 22 years in jail in addition to the eight years he is already serving for fraud and tax evasion.<br /><br />Critics have claimed that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are politically motivated due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition of former Russian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST news archive]. The transfer of the two from prison to Moscow to stand trial on the new charges was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/khodorkovsky-to-face-new-trial-as.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] two weeks ago by a judge for the District Court in Moscow. Khodorkovsky still maintains that his&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2005/05/russian-oil-magnate-guilty-on-six.php">2005 conviction</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] on the fraud and tax evasion was unjust, and maintains his innocence. He <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-yukos-oil-executive-applies-for.php">requested early release</a>&nbsp;from that sentence last July, but his application was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russian-court-denies-early-release-for.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] in August because he disobeyed guards at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/25/russia.tomparfitt">Krasnokamensk penal colony</a> [Guardian backgrounder], refused to participate in a training program, and faced the possibility of additional charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Sudanese President <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/29B42DAB-BF84-476F-9C8B-5515B3B731D6/279931/CISAlBashirEn.pdf">Omar al-Bashir</a> [ICC materials, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] on Thursday scoffed at the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639078.pdf">warrant</a> [text, PDF; ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/0EF62173-05ED-403A-80C8-F15EE1D25BB3.htm">release</a>] for his arrest issued by the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] earlier this week. Speaking to a crowd of thousands in Khartoum, Bashir said the warrant was an effort by Western countries to reassert colonial power over the country, and criticized the ICC for failing to take action in conflicts in Iraq and the Gaza Strip. Expanding on its <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-war-crimes-warrant-met.php">earlier reaction</a> [JURIST report] to the warrant, the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/">African Union</a>&nbsp;[official website] announced that it <a href="http://www.africasia.com/services/news/newsitem.php?area=africa&item=090305163411.sqkjl57w.php">plans to petition</a>&nbsp;[AFP report] the UN to have the warrant for Bashir suspended, sharing with several African and other countries the fear that it could disrupt a <a href="http://www.unmis.org/English/cpa.htm">peace deal</a> [UN backgrounder] in the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday heard oral arguments in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/prop8.htm#casefilings">three cases</a> [case filings] challenging the constitutionality of <a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm">Proposition 8</a> [materials], the ballot measure <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed in November</a> [JURIST report] that banned <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. <a href="http://www.eqca.org/">Equality California</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.eqca.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=kuLRJ9MRKrH&b=4869041&ct=6820523">challenged the validity</a> [press release] of the proposition, arguing that it went against the state&#39;s <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/const-toc.html">constitution</a> [materials], by stripping an entire class of people of what they said was the fundamental right to marry. It also argued that in order for such a broad change to be made, a constitutional revision, which requires not just a proposition, but approval by either two-thirds of the state&#39;s legislature or a statewide constitutional convention, was necessary. Arguing the case for the group, Shannon Minter, legal director of the <a href="http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a> (NCLR) [advocacy website] said allowing such a change undermined the principles of the constitution:<br /><blockquote>Our Constitution is based on the principle that majorities must respect minority rights. But if a majority can change the Constitution to take away a fundamental right from one group, then it can take away fundamental rights from any group. Our government will have changed from one that respects minority rights to one in which the power of the majority is unlimited.</blockquote> <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">ProtectMarriage</a> [advocacy website] argued in favor of <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/article/protectmarriage-com-yes-on-8-urges-california-supreme-court-to-uphold-proposition-8">affirming the proposition</a> [press release]. Counsel for ProtectMarriage, Kenneth Starr, argued that, because Proposition 8 was specific and limited in scope, it was appropriately passed by the ballot measure, and that the court could therefore not justifiably overturn the measure:<blockquote>Proposition 8&#8217;s brevity is matched by its clarity. There are no conditional clauses, exceptions, exemptions, or exclusions. Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California. Describing Proposition 8 as a revision to the state constitution, depends on characterizing Proposition 8 as a radical departure from the fundamental principles of the California Constitution.  But that portrayal is wildly wrong.  Proposition 8 is limited in nature and effect.  It does nothing more than restore the definition of marriage to what it was and always had been under California law before June 16, 2008 &#8211; and to what the people had repeatedly willed that it be throughout California&#8217;s history. It is now part of the state constitution.</blockquote>Commentators on the case have speculated that, given the thrust of the court&#39;s questions to the presenters of the arguments, the court appeared <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-prop8-supreme-court6-2009mar06,0,798075.story">unlikely to overrule</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">LA Times</span> report] the measure. The court is expected to issue a ruling on the matter within 90 days.<br /><br />In November, the California Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/S168047_S168066_S168078-11-19-08_ORDER.pdf">agreed</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/california-high-court-agrees-to-hear.php">report</a>] to hear the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/rights-groups-challenge-california-same.php">three cases</a> [JURIST report] challenging Proposition 8, but denied a <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/highprofile/documents/s168047-amendedpetitionforextraordinaryrelief.pdf">petition to stay</a> [text, PDF] its enforcement. Proposition 8 has become a focal point for gay rights, and during the campaign donors from across the US and several foreign countries contributed $83 million in total for both sides of the issue, setting US <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/california-marriage-battle-sets.php">fundraising records</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] spokesman Rupert Colville said Friday that his office may investigate whether Sudan&#39;s <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2009-03-05/sudan-aid-crisis-oxfam-gb-pulls-back-international-staff-khartoum">expulsion of foreign aid agencies</a> [Oxfam press release] is a possible breach of human rights law or war crime. Colville said that such an investigation had not yet begun, but&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/world/africa/07sudan.html?ref=world">strongly criticized</a>&nbsp;[NYT report] Sudan for ordering the groups to leave. Also Friday, UN <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">High Commissioner for Refugees</a> [official website] spokesman Ron Redmond warned that the removal of the aid agencies could <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/media?page=home&id=49b103bd2">have a serious impact</a> [press release] not only in Darfur, but also in the rest of Sudan and the region:<blockquote>Our experience shows that when vulnerable populations are unable to get the help they need, they go elsewhere in search of protection and assistance. If food can&#39;t get through to people, for example, then those people will soon suffer and have to look elsewhere.<br /><br />With some 4.7 million Sudanese &#8211; including 2.7 million internally displaced &#8211; already receiving assistance in Darfur, we are very concerned over the prospect of new population movements in the region should the fragile aid lifeline inside Sudan be disrupted. There are also 40,000 Chadian refugees in West Darfur.</blockquote> The statements come after an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.un.org/apps/sg/sgstats.asp?nid=3734">earlier plea</a>&nbsp;[press release] by UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] asking Sudan to allow the the agencies to remain in the country.<br /><br />The expulsion of the groups is seen as <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-bashir-derides-icc.php">retribution</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] by Sudanese President&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/29B42DAB-BF84-476F-9C8B-5515B3B731D6/279931/CISAlBashirEn.pdf">Omar al-Bashir</a> [ICC materials, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] against Western powers after the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639096.pdf">issued</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">report</a>] a warrant for his arrest earlier this week, charging him with seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The case was originally brought by the group <a href="http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/">Age Concern England</a> [advocacy website], which argued that the UK regulations violate a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/news/2001/jul/directive78ec_en.pdf">directive</a> [EC 2000/78, PDF] that prohibits discrimination based on age in regards to employment and occupation. In its decision, the ECJ emphasized that the UK regulations are only legal if they meet legitimate social policy objectives:<blockquote>Article 6(1) of Directive 2000/78 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude a national measure which, like Regulation 3 of the Regulations at issue in the main proceedings, does not contain a precise list of the aims justifying derogation from the principle prohibiting discrimination on grounds of age. However, Article 6(1) offers the option to derogate from that principle only in respect of measures justified by legitimate social policy objectives, such as those related to employment policy, the labour market or vocational training.</blockquote>The ruling follows a September <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/uk-mandatory-retirement-does-not.php">opinion</a> [JURIST report] by ECJ Advocate General Jan Marzak that concluded age-based classifications are justifiable in some circumstances. The ECJ ruling ultimately leaves the decision of whether the laws are legitimate and appropriate to the UK national courts. The decision placed a high standard of proof on the UK government for establishing the law&#39;s legitimacy, a position <a href="http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/fighting-on-release-050309.asp">welcomed</a> [press release] by Age Concern.<br /><br />Last year, the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/eu-court-upholds-mandatory-retirement.php">rejected an advocate general&#39;s opinion</a> [JURIST report; OUT-LAW <a href="http://www.out-law.com/page-8577">report</a>] in a Spanish <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/form.pl?lang=EN&Submit=rechercher&numaff=C-411/05">case</a> [ECJ materials] challenging an employer&#39;s mandatory retirement policy. The ECJ found that such policies do not violate the EU prohibition against age discrimination if intended to further the legitimate public interest of increasing employment and if the retirees are provided with full pensions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://europa.eu/">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] announced Friday that it has <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/NewsRoom/loadDocument.aspx?id=221&lang=EN&directory=en/esdp/&fileName=106547.pdf">entered into an agreement with Kenya</a> [press release, PDF] to transfer suspected <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=pirates">pirates</a> [JURIST news archive] captured by EU counter-pirate operations into Kenyan custody for prosecution. The agreement contains provisions for the nine Somali pirates <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4077397,00.html">captured by German forces</a> [DW report] on Tuesday, and &quot;defines modalities&quot; for any capture of suspected pirates in the future. Germany has maintained a presence in the Gulf of Aden as a part of the EU&#39;s Naval Forces Atalanta mission to stem pirate activity in the troubled Gulf region. The EU&#39;s agreement with Kenya is the <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/function/0,,12215_cid_4078913,00.html">first agreement</a> [DW report] between the EU and a country located within that African region. <br /><br />Kenya has become the lead prosecutor of suspected pirates captured by third-party countries within the Gulf of Aden. In November, eight Somalis were <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/suspected-somalia-pirates-captured-by.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] in a <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.ke/website/index.php">Kenyan court</a> [Kenya judiciary website] for piracy after being turned over to Kenyan officials by the British <a href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/">Royal Navy</a> [official website]. In January 2006, the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/swf/index.asp">US Navy</a> [official website] captured 10 Somali men 200 miles off the coast of Somalia and turned them over to Kenyan courts in Mombasa for <a href="http://nairobi.usembassy.gov/pr_20060202.html">prosecution</a> [press release]. In November 2006, each of the 10 men was sentenced to seven years in prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Friday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/030609zr.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] a motion by the US government to dismiss as moot an appeal challenging the indefinite detention of suspected al Qaeda operative <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/ali_saleh_kahlah_al_marri/index.html">Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-marri">news archive</a>]. The Court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-takes-al-marri-detainee.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in December on al-Marri&#39;s appeal of a ruling by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upholding his detention. Acting Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler presented a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/motion-to-dismiss-al-marri.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] to the Court, asking it to dismiss the appeal as moot in light of the administration&#39;s decision last week to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/enemy-combatant-al-marri-to-be-tried-in.php">try al-Marri in US federal court</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Marri was <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/terrorism/usalmarri22609ind.html">indicted</a> [indictment text; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-ag-177.html">press release</a>] last week on two charges of providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring with others to provide material support to al Qaeda.<br /><br />In January, shortly after taking office, President Barack Obama ordered an <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-immediate-review-of.php">immediate review</a> [JURIST report] of al-Marri&#39;s detention. Al-Marri was arrested at his home in Peoria, Illinois by civilian authorities in 2001, and was indicted for other crimes. In 2003, then-President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/23/qatar.combatant/">declared him an enemy combatant</a> [CNN report] and ordered the attorney general to transfer custody of al-Marri to the defense secretary, claiming inherent authority to hold him indefinitely. His indefinite detention and classification as an enemy combatant caused controversy between the Bush administration and rights groups including the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which is providing him with <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/detention/case_almarri.html">legal representation</a> [case materials]. Al-Marri has <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/enemy-combatant-detained-in-military.php">claimed abuse</a> [JURIST report] while being held in a US Navy brig in Charleston, South Carolina, where he currently remains.

The reversed two counts of mail fraud against Siegelman based a lack of evidence, but upheld the remaining five charges. All of the charges against Scrushy were upheld. In confirming the bribery charges, the court rejected the appellants&#39; argument that there was not evidence of an explicit agreement of quid pro quo between Siegelman and Scrushy, a necessary element for federal bribery charges:<blockquote>What is missing in this record, according to defendants, is any evidence of a discussion between Governor Siegelman and Scrushy to the effect of &quot;I will make this contribution, and in exchange for this contribution you will appoint me[&quot;]... We disagree ... Bailey&#8217;s testimony was competent evidence that Siegelman and Scrushy had agreed to a deal in which Scrushy&#8217;s donation would be rewarded with a seat on the CON Board. The jurors were free to give it a different construction, but they did not. Furthermore, this was not the sole evidence that Scrushy bribed Siegelman. The jury was entitled to construe this conversation in the context of the substantial additional testimony they had heard regarding Scrushy&#8217;s donation to the lottery campaign fund.</blockquote>While the court remanded Siegelman&#39;s case for resentencing, his attorneys have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hTOPaU3NmV4Q17RTCuve0_OYX3AgD96OQS300">said they will appeal</a> [AP report] the decision. <br /><br />In 2007, Siegelman was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/former-alabama-governor-sentenced-for.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to over seven years in prison. Siegelman was originally convicted on seven counts, including bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud. Scrushy was found guilty of fraud and both were also convicted in connection with a $500,000 payment from Scrushy for Siegelman&#39;s 1999 campaign debts in exchange for a seat on a state-operated review board that regulates hospitals. Scrushy was also sentenced to six years and 10 months in prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Bangladeshi officials said Saturday that the government is considering trying by <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=court+martial">court-martial</a> [JURIST report] the more than 1,000 border guards accused of participating in the <a href="http://www.bdr.gov.bd/">Bangladesh Rifles</a> (BDR) [official website] <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7912112.stm">mutiny</a> [BBC backgrounder], which killed dozens of top BDR officials, including the force&#39;s commander. Law Minister <a href="http://www.minlaw.gov.bd/hministeroffice.htm">Shafique Ahmed</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=78899">said the government would wait</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span> report] for an investigation report before deciding between prosecution under conventional law or special tribunal. Ahmed said BDR members could be tried under the <a href="http://www.bdlaws.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?act_name=&vol=&id=248">Army Act 1952</a> [text], while outsiders could face charges under the International War Crime Tribunal Act 1973 or the Special Tribunal Act, which would require a constitutional amendment. The death penalty is available under each of these laws. The US has sent a <a href="http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?cid=2&id=78239&hb=1">two-person FBI team</a> [bdnews24 report] to Bangladesh to assist the investigation.<br /><br />Last week, police in Bangladesh <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/bangladesh-police-charge-more-than-1000.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] more than 1,000 members of the paramilitary BDR in connection with the mutiny. The incident comes in a time of difficult transition for Bangladesh. Voters elected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in December 2008, ending two years of military rule. In January, Ahmed <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/bangladesh-government-declares-desire.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] his government&#39;s desire to restore Bangladesh&#39;s <a href="http://aceproject.org/ero-en/regions/asia/BD/Bangladesh%20Constitution%201972.pdf">1972 constitution</a> [text, PDF].  Prior to the elections, interim Bangladeshi president Iajuddin Ahmed <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/bangladesh-lifts-two-year-emergency.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Emergency Powers (Repeal) Ordinance of 2008, lifting a two-year state of emergency to allow for political campaigning. The state of emergency, <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/bangladesh-president-declares-state-of.php">declared in January 2007</a> [JURIST report], had suspended democratic rights throughout the country.

Bashir has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-03-08-voa1.cfm">expelled 13 foreign aid agencies</a>&nbsp;[VOA report] from Sudan after the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] last week issued a <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639078.pdf">warrant</a> [text, PDF] for his arrest. Human rights and other groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-war-crimes-warrant-met.php">have urged Bashir</a> [JURIST report] to allow the agencies to remain in the country, and UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] spokesman Rupert Colville has said that his office <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-may-investigate-sudan-for-expelling.php">may investigate</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] whether Sudan&#39;s removal of the groups is a possible breach of human rights law or war crime. Bashir has said that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-affirms-commitment-to.php">remains committed</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] to a peace deal his government has with opposition groups in the country despite the warrant, but warned that foreign nationals still in Sudan would have to obey his government or also face expulsion.<br /><br />The ICC&#39;s warrant against Bashir&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc639096.pdf">includes</a> [decision, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">report</a>] seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-to-rule-on-bashir-arrest-warrant.php">announced last week</a> [JURIST report] that they would decide whether to issue an arrest warrant on Wednesday. The announcement came after the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/world/africa/12hague.html">reported</a> [NYT report] last month that the warrant had been issued, leading a court official quickly to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icc-denies-reports-that-bashir-arrest.php">issue a denial</a> [JURIST report].

Al-Bashir also used the rally to strike out at aid groups <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-may-investigate-sudan-for-expelling.php">expelled from the country</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week, calling them &quot;<a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE52620520090307?sp=true">spies and thieves</a>&quot; [Reuters report] and accusing them of using the majority of the money donated to them for personal profit.<br /><br />On Thursday, al-Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-bashir-derides-icc.php">strongly criticized</a> [JURIST report] the ICC warrant, calling it an attempt by Western powers to reassert colonial power over the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese government has not accounted for hundreds of Tibetan protesters arrested in connection with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7299221.stm">March 2008 demonstrations in Tibet</a> [BBC backgrounder], according to a Monday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/09/china-hundreds-tibetan-detainees-and-prisoners-unaccounted">statement</a> [press release] from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website], which revealed a thorough review regarding the numbers of arrests, detentions, and trials of the protesters. The press release revealed discrepancies in the numbers of demonstrators detained and released as reported by state media sources and government officials. HRW also called on the Chinese government to provide an extensive account of all who were detained, released, tried, and sentenced in relation to the protests; to allow neutral international organizations full access to detention facilities; and to observe and respect the human rights of all the demonstrators in their custody. The Chinese government has insisted that the claims of human rights abuses have been perpetuated by ethnic Tibetan factions dissatisfied by the Communist Party. Asia advocacy director at HRW Sophie Richardson said that the Chinese government has been using these excuses and has not been cooperative with any international human rights organizations at revealing the numbers of alleged arbitrary arrests, detentions, and sentencing hearings, adding that:<blockquote>The government&#39;s national security concerns do not exempt it from its obligation to respect fundamental rights and freedoms and offer equal status before the law to all its citizens, whatever their ethnicity ... Yet Beijing&#39;s own official accounts reflect judicial defects so severe that it is not possible to deliver a fair trial to any one accused of having taken part in the protests last year.</blockquote>There are allegedly several hundred protesters still in custody and documents have revealed that contrary to information supplied by the Chinese government, several demonstrators died after the March 2008 demonstrations. To date there has been no public information regarding the trials of the remaining demonstrators. <br /><br />Last June, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/china-reports-release-of-tibetan.php">released more than 1000 demonstrators</a> [JURIST report] detained by authorities during the March 2008 demonstrations against Chinese rule in Tibet. In April 2008, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/china-court-jails-30-for-involvement-in.php">sentenced 30 people to prison</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in the demonstrations. Chinese officials have blamed the exiled <a href="http://www.dalailama.com/">Dalai Lama</a> [personal website] for organizing the protests. Rights groups have criticized China for ongoing human rights violations [HRW materials] targeted at Tibetans, and many call for the <a href="http://www.freetibet.org/">total independence</a> [advocacy website] of the currently &quot;semi-autonomous&quot; region.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Spain&#39;s <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/eversuite/GetRecords?Template=cgpj/cgpj/principal.htm">General Council of the Judiciary</a> (CGPJ) [official website, in Spanish] on Tuesday said that there will be an investigation into the failure of Judge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3085482.stm">Baltasar Garzon</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Baltasar+Garzon">news archive</a>] to report his earnings while on sabbatical in the US. Garzon, famed for indicting <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> and former Latin American dictator <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archives], <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Poder/Judicial/abre/investigacion/Garzon/ingresos/EE/UU/elpepuesp/20090310elpepunac_9/Tes">took a leave of absence</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish] and accepted a teaching position at New York University between 2005 and 2006 but did not report his earnings. According to CGPJ, any Spanish judge taking a leave of absence must report to the judicial oversight committee any salaries that will be received during that time. While there will be no disciplinary hearing, if he is found to be in violation of the rules, Garzon could be fined, suspended, or possibly expelled.<br /><br />In addition to the Pinochet and bin Laden indictments, Garzon is well known for his involvement in high-profile investigations of terror and human rights cases.  Last October, he <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the exhumation of 19 mass graves in Spain, launching an investigation into the disappearances of tens of thousands of people beginning in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A882902">Spanish Civil War</a> [BBC backgrounder], and continuing through the early years of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco dictatorship</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Garzon has also called for the creation of a &quot;<a href="/paperchase/2005/02/spanish-judge-calls-for-franco-truth.php">truth commission</a>&quot; [JURIST report] to uncover Franco-era abuses.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of lawyers called Monday for the formation of an International Finance Court to adjudicate the issues around the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] fraud case. The Madoff Case Global Alliance of Law Firms, <a href="http://www.advocatenorde.nl/public/file/WORD/OD_19_febr_Persbericht_Madoff.doc">established last month</a> [press release, DOC] at a meeting in Spain, aims to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE5286FE20090309">form an international network</a> [Reuters report] to facilitate sharing information and developing strategies. They say an international forum must be established to address the complex issues of the case because of their sheer magnitude and because they unfold across several legal systems. The group plans to meet Wednesday with US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/schapiro.htm">Mary Schapiro</a> [official profile] to lobby for their proposal. The alliance also plans to present their proposal to the <a href="http://www.g20.org/">Group of 20</a> (G-20) [official website] at their April meeting in London in the belief that their plan should be organized in conjunction with the UN, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Leading the coalition of lawyers is <a href="http://www.cremadescalvosotelo.com/cv_cremades_javier.htm">Javier Cremades</a> [professional profile, in Spanish], from the Spanish law firm <a href="http://www.cremadescalvosotelo.com/index.htm">Cremades &amp; Calvo-Sotelo</a> [firm website, in Spanish], and <a href="http://www.mccarter.com/new/showbionew.aspx?show=2691&Related=">Gaytri Kachroo</a> [professional profile], from the US law firm <a href="http://www.mccarter.com/new/homenew.aspx">McCarter &amp; English</a> [firm website]. Cremades and his law firm have brought a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/d58000e0-ec75-11dd-a534-0000779fd2ac.pdf">lawsuit</a> [summons, PDF] against the Spanish bank <a href="http://www.santander.com/csgs/Satellite?accesibilidad=3&canal=CAccionistas&empr=SANCorporativo&pagename=SANCorporativo/GSDistribuidora/SC_Index">Santander</a> [corporate website, in Spanish] in a US federal court, although the case has not yet been adjudicated as the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601127&sid=ay6bjuGT.Na0&refer=law">judge questions the appropriateness of jurisdiction</a> [Bloomberg report] and the need for court intervention. McCarter and English is the law firm representing <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/01/08/the_whistleblower/">Harry Markopolos</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Boston Globe</span> profile], a whistleblower who <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/9189285/Markopolos-Madoff-Complaint">accused</a> [text] Madoff of fraud before the SEC in 2005.<br /><br />In February, Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/madoff-reaches-agreement-with-sec-on.php">consented to a partial judgment</a> [JURIST report] with the SEC over civil charges brought by the SEC to obtain preliminary injunction and freeze Madoff&#39;s assets. Madoff still faces <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] by the SEC. The SEC&#39;s capacity for enforcement has been heavily questioned in the wake of the alleged Ponzi schemes perpetrated by Madoff and other financiers like <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">Allen Stanford</a> [JURIST report].

Odinga <a href="http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/Local/FBI-to-probe-Kenya-murders-3604.html">requested US assistance</a> [<em>Capital News report</em>], recognizing that there would be a serious issue of credibility because the police themselves are among the list of suspects and stating that &quot;the government [is] committed to uphold all fundamental rights and freedoms bestowed in the constitution of the country.&quot; On Friday, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) charged that the killing of human rights activists Oscar Kamau Kingara and John Paul Oulu was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j4PDbHrE9McNCnyGXOJdNkNsPMyQD96OGPAO0">part of a trend</a> [AP report] to silence those who have denounced police human rights abuses and extrajudicial executions. The two men were officers for the <a href="http://oscarfound.org/index.html">Oscar Foundation</a> [advocacy website], a group critical of the Kenyan government for its use of extra-judicial killings, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7928519.stm">were killed in Nairobi</a> [BBC report] Thursday following student protests against police.<br /><br />On Friday UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions</a> [official website] Philip Alston <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/kenya-rights-activist-killings-must-be.php">called for an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the killings. Alston also <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/542438/-/u32wc5/-/">called for the resignation</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Daily Nation</font> report] of Police Commissioner Hussein Ali and Attorney General Amos Wako in light of the killings, but Ali rebuked Alston&#39;s call and said that the police were capable of investigating the murders without a special investigation. In February, Alston issued a <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/52DF4BE7194A7598C125756800539D79?opendocument">report</a> [text] on extra-judicial killings in Kenya in which he said that killings by the police in the country were &quot;systematic, widespread and carefully planned,&quot; and that they were committed with &quot;utter impunity.&quot; During his trip to the country, Alston met with Kingara, and the Oscar Foundation in 2007 <a href="http://www.oscarfound.org/downloads/youth_State_Repression.pdf">issued its own report</a> [text, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/8000-killed-by-kenya-police-in.php">report</a>] claiming that police had killed more than 8,000 for their alleged connections to the Mungiki group.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] decided four cases Monday. The Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-689.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-4 in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-689">Bartlett v. Strickland</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-hears-criminal-procedure.php">report</a>] that a racial minority group that comprises less than 50 percent of a district&#39;s population cannot succeed on a vote dilution claim. In a plurality opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy ruled that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/usc_sec_42_00001973----000-.html">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> [text] does not require a redrawing of the district:<blockquote>Crossover districts are, by definition, the result of white voters joining forces with minority voters to elect their preferred candidate. The Voting Rights Act was passed to foster this cooperation. We decline now to expand the reaches of &sect;2 to require, by force of law, the voluntary cooperation our society has achieved.</blockquote>The ruling upheld the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court, which <a href="http://www.aoc.state.nc.us/www/public/sc/opinions/2007/pdf/103-06-1.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Act only applies to districts where the minority population constitutes 50 percent or more of voters. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Antonin Scalia joined. Justice David Souter filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer joined.<br /><br />The Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-773.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-773">Vaden v. Discover Bank</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/supreme-court-hears-cigarette-labeling.php">report</a>] that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear lawsuits brought under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode09/usc_sup_01_9.html">Federal Arbitration Act</a> [text] to compel arbitration when the claim does not raise a federal question but the underlying dispute to be arbitrated involves federal law. However, the Court also ruled that the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit improperly <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/061221.P.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that a federal question existed and reversed the opinion below. Writing for the Court, Ginsburg determined:<blockquote>We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part. A federal court may &quot;look through&quot; a &sect;4 petition and order arbitration if, &quot;save for [the arbitration] agreement,&quot; the court would have jurisdiction over &quot;the [substantive] controversy between the parties.&quot; We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals misidentified the dimensions of &quot;the controversy between the parties.&quot; ... Given that entirely state-based plea and the established rule that federal-court jurisdiction cannot be invoked on the basis of a defense or counterclaim, the whole &quot;controversy between the parties&quot; does not qualify for federal-court adjudication.</blockquote>Justice John Roberts filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justices Stevens, Breyer, and Samuel Alito joined. Roberts agreed that the court should be able to &quot;look through&quot; to the underlying claim but would have allowed the district court to compel arbitration.<br /><br />In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-88">Vermont v. Brillon</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-hears-right-to-counsel.php">report</a>], the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-88.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 7-2 that delays caused solely by a public defender do not violate a defendant&#39;s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The defendant Michael Brillon faced assault charges, awaiting trial for three years while he was assigned to six different public defenders. Ginsburg wrote for the majority:<blockquote>Assigned counsel, just as retained counsel, act on behalf of their clients, and delays sought by counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent. For a total of some six months of the time that elapsed between Brillon&#39;s arrest and his trial, Brillon lacked an attorney. The State may be charged with those months if the gaps resulted from the trial court&#39;s failure to appoint replacement counsel with dispatch. Similarly, the State may bear responsibility if there is &quot;a breakdown in the public defender system.&quot; But, as the Vermont Supreme Court acknowledged, the record does not establish any such institutional breakdown. [citations omitted]</blockquote>The ruling overturned the <a href="http://170.222.4.25/supct/current/op2005-167.html">decision</a> [opinion text] of the Vermont Supreme Court, which held that the delay violated Brillon&#39;s Sixth Amendment rights. Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens joined.<br /><br />In <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-hears-fee-assignment.php">Kansas v. Colorado</a> [JURIST report], the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/105Orig.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously that it is limited to the same cap on expert witness fees that applies in a district court when the case falls under the Supreme Court&#39;s original and exclusive jurisdiction. The Court has constitutionally mandated <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleiii.html#section2">original jurisdiction</a> [Article 3, &sect; 2 text] over the case because it is a dispute between two states. In 2001, the Court <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/533/1/case.html">ruled</a> [opinion] that Colorado was liable for millions of dollars in damages and interest for diverting water from the Arkansas River into Colorado farm lands. The dispute continued, and in 2004, the Court <a href="http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/543/543.US.86.105.html">ordered a special master to further investigate the situation</a> [opinion]. The special master determined that US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1821.html">law</a> [28 USC &sect; 1821(b) text] caps a witness&#39; attendance fee at $40 per day, but Kansas argued that the legislative intent behind the statute was meant to bind only lower courts and that the Supreme Court is statutorily unlimited in awarding fees in cases of original jurisdiction. In an opinion by Alito, the Court overruled Kansas&#39;s exceptions to the special master&#39;s report:<blockquote>[W]e conclude that the best approach is to have a uniform rule that applies in all federal cases.<br /><br />We therefore hold that the expert witness attendance fees that are available in cases brought under our original jurisdiction shall be the same as the expert witness attendance fees that would be available in a district court under &sect;1821(b).</blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/03/09/A-debt-of-gratitude-to-so-many-tireless-advocates/">signed</a> [press release] an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Removing-Barriers-to-Responsible-Scientific-Research-Involving-Human-Stem-Cells/">executive order</a> [text; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Fact-Sheet-on-Presidential-Executive-Order/">fact sheet</a>] Monday which removed the previous administration&#39;s restrictions on federal funding for human embryonic <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=stem+cell">stem cell</a> [JURIST news archive] research. The order fulfills Obama&#39;s campaign promise to reverse the limitations that were put in place eight years ago by the Bush administration. Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-As-Prepared-for-Delivery-Signing-of-Stem-Cell-Executive-Order-and-Scientific-Integrity-Presidential-Memorandum/">stated his reasoning</a> [prepared remarks] for removing the barriers in the order:<blockquote>Research involving human embryonic stem cells and human non-embryonic stem cells has the potential to lead to better understanding and treatment of many disabling diseases and conditions.  Advances over the past decade in this promising scientific field have been encouraging, leading to broad agreement in the scientific community that the research should be supported by Federal funds.<br /><br />For the past 8 years, the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to fund and conduct human embryonic stem cell research has been limited by Presidential actions.  The purpose of this order is to remove these limitations on scientific inquiry, to expand NIH support for the exploration of human stem cell research, and in so doing to enhance the contribution of America&#39;s scientists to important new discoveries and new therapies for the benefit of humankind.</blockquote>Also Monday, Obama issued the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Memorandum-for-the-Heads-of-Executive-Departments-and-Agencies-3-9-09/">Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity</a> [text; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Fact-Sheet-on-Presidential-Memorandum-on-Scientific-Integrity/">fact sheet</a>], which charges the Director of the <a href="http://www.ostp.gov/">Office of Science and Technology Policy</a> (OSTP) [official website] with developing strategies to ensure government agencies follow proper procedures for disclosing scientific findings, for reviewing such findings, and for protecting the scientific process, including protection of whistleblowers. The memorandum also orders the director to ensure that scientific and technology positions in the executive branch are filled based on an individual&#39;s technological knowledge, credentials, and experience.<br /><br />In 2007, then-president George W. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/bush-vetoes-bill-easing-funding-limits.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:SN00005:">Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007</a> [S 5 materials], which was intended to relax funding restrictions on embryonic stem cell research. At that time, the administration said the bill would, for the first time, compel taxpayers to support the destruction of human embryos, a &quot;moral line&quot; the president would not allow the nation to cross. In 2006, Bush <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/breaking-news-bush-vetoes-stem-cell.php">vetoed a previous version</a> [JURIST report] of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, which was passed by the Senate to remove restrictions on embryonic stem cell research, saying he would not provide federal funding for stem cell research because many consider the destruction of embryos to be murder.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the  <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] on Friday rejected an attempt by former Illinois governor <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Blagojevich">Rod Blagojevich</a> [JURIST news archive] to have US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald of the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/index.html">US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] removed from his federal corruption case. The ruling by Judge James Holderman <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a2It0qWf815Y&refer=us">denied</a> [Bloomberg report] Blagojevich&#39;s request to disqualify Fitzgerald from the case. Blagojevich had argued that Fitzgerald should be removed from the case for making biased and inflammatory remarks during a January press conference.<br /><br />In January, the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office. Blagojevich is the first Illinois governor to be impeached and removed from office. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/house/default.asp">Illinois House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-legislative-committee.php">voted 114-1 to impeach</a> [JURIST report]. Blagojevich had <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/blagojevich-boycotts-proceedings-as.php">boycotted</a> [JURIST report] the impeachment proceedings against him, appearing only at the end of the Senate hearings to make a final plea to remain in office. Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December by federal agents on charges of corruption. Both Blagojevich and Harris have been <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2008/pr1209_01.pdf">charged</a> [DOJ press release, PDF] with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery. They are accused of conspiring to sell or trade the senate seat left vacant by President Barack Obama, obtaining illegal campaign contributions, and threatening to withhold assistance to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> with the sale of Wrigley Field unless two editorial writers who had been critical of Blagojevich were fired. Harris resigned his position after the arrest, but Blagojevich refused to resign.

The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] had acknowledged last week that the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF] 92 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes of high value terrorism suspect interrogations</a> [JURIST news archive], in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information.  The August 2008 order came in response to a December 2007 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/aclu_v_dod_memo_contemptmotion.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA be held in contempt of court for not providing information on the tapes during a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/torturefoia.html">lawsuit</a> [ACLU materials] brought by the organization in an effort to access government materials on the interrogations.<br /><br />A stay on the ACLU suit was filed by the DOJ in December 2007 while a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/doj-opens-criminal-probe-into-cia.php">criminal probe</a> [JURIST report] was conducted on the videotapes&#39; destruction. That order expired last week, and in a letter to the court, US Attorney Peter Skinner wrote that the DOJ now intends to provide as much of the information as possible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Israeli president <A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6054502.stm">Moshe Katsav</A> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Katsav">news archive</a>] will be indicted on rape charges for allegedly assaulting several female employees in the 1990s, according to an announcement by Attorney General Menachem Mazuz on Sunday. Katsav <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1069709.html">will face charges</a> [Haaretz report] of raping one woman while he served as minister of tourism and sexually assaulting two others during his presidency. Katsav&#39;s brother <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1069719.html">denounced the charges as false</a> [Haaretz report], claiming Mazuz was unduly influenced. Women&#39;s rights organizations <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1069610.html">welcomed the decision</a> [Haaretz report] to bring charges.<br /><br />Katsav was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/israel-president-may-face-rape-sex.php">originally accused of rape</a> [JURIST report] and sexual assault in 2006. In April, Katsav <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-ex-president-rejects-plea.php">rejected</a> a controversial <A src="/paperchase/2007/06/israel-president-to-resign-under-plea.php">plea agreement</A> [JURIST reports], under which he would have been permitted to plead guilty to lesser sex charges of indecent assault, sexual harassment, and obstruction of justice, in exchange for a suspended sentence and the dropping of the rape charges. The deal was <A src="/paperchase/2007/07/israel-high-court-puts-katsav-plea.php">heavily criticized</A> [JURIST report] by women&#39;s and civil rights activists when it was first made public in 2007. A victim and several rights organizations filed <A HREF="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/877071.html">five separate petitions</A> [<em>Haaretz</em> report] to overturn the agreement, arguing that it was contrary to public interest, had no legal reason, and injured the principal of equality before the law. Despite the criticism, Mazuz defended the agreement as necessary to protect the office of the presidency from further injury and spare the country from embarrassment. Katsav resigned the presidency in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israeli rights group <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/site/index.php">Yesh Din</a> [advocacy website, in Hebrew] filed a <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/sys/images/File/QuarriesPetitionEng%5B1%5D.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.yesh-din.org/site/index.php?page=index&lang=en&id=">press release</a>] in the <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/home/index.html">Supreme Court of Israel</a> [official website] Monday, accusing the State of Israel of violating international law based on the mining operations it conducts within the West Bank. According to the complaint, the mining removes 12 million tons of stone and gravel each year from the West Bank, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ioi_0jtO9RjMwPNRoXNCndRPRq3gD96QJJ300">9 million tons of which are used for the economic benefit of the State of Israel</a> [AP report] and private Israeli companies. The group referred to many different international treaties, including provisions of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a> [ICRC materials], and general principles of international law in setting out its assertion of illegality:<blockquote>The rules of occupation constitute a regime of temporary trust which necessitates that, among other things, any long-term alteration made in the occupied territory, inasmuch as it is permissible, shall benefit the local population (which is the population of protected civilians).  Another, negative aspect of the trustee&#39;s duty are rules that ban the occupying power from exploiting the territories under its domain for its own needs, except for (with certain restrictions) its security needs.<br /><br />Unlike in the case of the permissibility of mining for natural resources in an occupied territory as a rule, in this matter -- quarrying for natural resources for the benefit of the occupying power -- the scholars are not disputed at all.  It is agreed by all of them that not only is this a violation of the international laws of occupation, but many of them even believe that under certain circumstances, this constitutes the war crime of pillage...the occupant does not have the right to use property or to other rights he manages in the occupied territories for purposes other than maintaining public order and safety in the occupied territory.</blockquote>Israel has denied any violations, and said that the mining <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7933155.stm">is carried out according to agreements with Palestinians</a> [BBC report].<br /><br />Israel has been strongly criticized by the international community over its settlement and land appropriation activities, particularly in the West Bank. In November, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/israel-destruction-of-palestine-homes.php">Switzerland condemned Israeli destruction of Palestinian homes</a> [JURIST report] in East Jerusalem as a violation of international humanitarian law. In September, Israeli human rights group <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/index.asp">B&#39;Tselem</a> [advocacy website] reported that Israeli security policies have resulted in <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/report-accuses-israel-of-excluding.php">Palestinians being prevented from accessing land</a> [JURIST report] adjacent to settlements in the West Bank. In July, Yesh Din highlighted the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/israel-police-unresponsive-to-violence.php">lack of investigations and prosecutions</a> [JURIST report] of Israeli settlers in the Occupied Territories who commit crimes against Palestinians. In June, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] said that Israeli <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/989016.html">plans to expand settlements</a> [Ha&#39;aretz report] in the West Bank <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/israel-west-bank-settlement-plan.php">violate international law</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] has distanced himself from remarks by <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] in which he characterized the US as a &quot;nation of cowards&quot; on race matters, according to an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/08/us/politics/08race.html?_r=1">interview</a> [NYT report] with the <font style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</font> published Saturday. Holder made the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2009/ag-speech-090218.html">statement</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ag-holder-to-doj-us-still-faces-racial.php">report</a>] during a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Justice Department</a> (DOJ) [official website] event commemorating Black History Month in February, and he has been <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-02-20-voa46.cfm">criticized by some groups</a> [VOA report] for the comment. In his interview with the <font style="font-style:italic;">Times</font>, Obama said that Holder had made some good points in his speech, but that he would have advised the attorney general to use different language. Obama said that he believed the remaining racial tensions in the country could be best resolved by economic development and improved education and health care.<br /><br />Earlier in February, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">US Senate</a> [official website] voted 75-21 to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-senate-confirms-holder-as-attorney.php">confirm</a> [JURIST report] Holder as attorney general. Prior to becoming the attorney general, Holder served as a associate judge for the <a href="http://www.dccourts.gov/dccourts/superior/index.jsp">Superior Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/archive/index-dag.html">Deputy US Attorney General</a> [archive materials] during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Holder served as acting attorney general during a brief period of the Bush administration before the confirmation of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1120440.stm">John Ashcroft</a> [BBC profile].

Bennett, a top aide to MDC head <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1870283.stm">Morgan Tsvangirai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tsvangirai">news archive</a>], faces charges under Zimbabwe&#39;s <a href="http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/legisl/020122posa.asp?sector=LEGISL&year=0&range_start=1">Public Order and Security Act</a> [materials] for &quot;attempting to commit terrorism, banditry and sabotage.&quot; Under the <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=957864">terms of his bail</a> [<em>Times</em> report], Bennett had to pay USD $5,000 and surrender his passport, and he must report to police three times a week. Last week, the High Court rejected a <a href="http://www.talkzimbabwe.com/news/117/ARTICLE/4367/2009-02-25.html">state appeal seeking to deny Bennett bail</a> [TGZ report], finding that the conditions of Bennett&#39;s release, set last month, were adequate.

It is feared that Bennett&#39;s arrest could pose a threat to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/zimbabwe-leaders-sign-power-sharing.php">power-sharing agreement</a> [JURIST report] between the MDC and the African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>]. Bennett was originally <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/zimbabwe-police-arrest-15-for-plotting.php">sought for questioning</a> [JURIST report] in relation to the allegations in 2006, but he had been seeking asylum in South Africa <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20090130112041597C347722">until recently</a> [IOL report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] High litigation costs are impeding the advancement of justice in the United States, and significant changes should be made to federal discovery rules, according to a <a href="http://www.actl.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=4008">report</a> [text, PDF; ACTL <a href="http://www.actl.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&CONTENTID=4010">press release</a>, PDF] issued Wednesday by a special task force composed of members of the <a href="http://www.actl.com/">American College of Trial Lawyers</a> (ACTL) [advocacy website] and the University of Denver&#39;s <a href="http://www.du.edu/legalinstitute/">Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System</a> (IAALS) [academic website]. Responding to what it described as a popular perception that the US civil justice system is &quot;<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/188597">broken</a>&quot; [AP report] and in need of repair, the Task Force Committee on Discovery Project said it intends the 29 principles proposed in its report to act as a guide and provide an eventual underpinning for an anticipated &quot;transformation of civil procedure in federal and state systems throughout the United States.&quot; Among the topics covered by the principles are: the &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach to lawsuits contained in the current <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/">Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</a> [text]; a move from notice-based pleadings to fact-based pleadings; details and mechanics of pre-trial discovery, including electronic discovery; the role of expert witnesses; and dispositive pre-trial motions.<br /><br />The committee was formed to examine federal and state rules of civil procedure pertaining to discovery in order to <a href="http://www.actl.com/source/members/actl_committeeRoster.cfm?section=Task_Force_Committee_Chairs&co=DISCOVERY">determine</a> [committee membership page] if the current rules could be adjusted to provide a &quot;fair and less expensive approach to information exchange in litigation[.]&quot; The group is composed of a number of prominent litigation attorneys from across the country, and has characterized the current discovery rules as outdated and not flexible enough to adapt to the rapid technological advances in litigation and trial practice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of <a href="http://en.ljbc.net/home.php">Libya</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/countries/libya.php">news archive</a>] has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/10/libya-two-political-prisoners-freed">released two men</a> [HRW press release] convicted in 2007 of planning to overthrow the government and meeting with a foreign official, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] announced Tuesday. Jamal al-Haji and Faraj Humaid were arrested as part of a larger group in Tripoli in February 2007, in advance of a demonstration commemorating the deaths of 11 people during a 2006 clash between protesters and police. The nine other men arrested with al-Haji and Humaid were <a href="http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/node/1471">released</a> [Frontline Defenders report] by the end of 2008. HRW Middle East and North Africa director Sarah Leah Whitson called the men&#39;s release &quot;a particularly welcome step in light of the Libyan authorities&#39; stated initiative of breaking with the past.&quot;<br /><br />Libya has had a mixed human rights record in recent years. The release of the political prisoners comes as relations between Libya and the US are improving, though the State Department recently <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">criticised</a> [JURIST report] Libya for its continued detention of political prisoners [JURIST report] in its <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/index.htm">2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices</a> [DOS materials]. In 2008, the US and Libya reached an <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/us-reaches-settlement-on-libya-terror.php">agreement to settle all pending lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] brought by US terror victims against Libya. In 2004, the US <a href="/paperchase/2004/09/bushs-lifting-of-sanctions-against.php">lifted the remaining sanctions</a> [JURIST report] against Libya as a reward for its agreement to dismantle its weapons programs. At the same time, Libya faced international <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/france-judges-investigate-torture.php">criticism</a> [JURIST report] for its treatment of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=libya+bulgarian">six foreign medics</a> [JURIST news archive] accused infecting hospital patients with HIV in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/terrorism/rapporteur/srchr.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=scheinin">news archive</a>] on Tuesday cited the case of Canadian citizen and former US detainee <a href="http://www.maherarar.ca/">Maher Arar</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=arar">news archive</a>] in presenting a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.3.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-rights-rapporteur-calls-for-greater.php">report</a>] critical of international counterterrorism practices to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website]  in Geneva. Scheinin flagged Arar&#39;s deportation from the US <br />as an example of how intelligence sharing without &quot;adequate safeguards&quot; can lead to human rights violations. The report was broadly critical of US <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] policies and also <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/10/un-condemns-britains-role_n_173440.html">censured the United Kingdom</a> [<em>Independent</em> report], Australia and other countries for providing assistance to the US. Speaking to reporters after presenting the report, Scheinin said that UN human rights investigators will be <a href="http://www2.canada.com/topics/news/story.html?id=1374351">looking into possible human rights violations committed by the US</a> [Reuters report] during the &quot;war on terror&quot; and that the investigation will not be relaxed because of a change in administrations. On Wednesday, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090311/ap_on_re_eu/eu_britain_torture">UK will not conduct an official judicial inquiry</a> [AP report] into whether British intelligence officials ever acted illegally in assisting the US, but did note that police could initiate such investigations.<br /><br />Scheinin has been a vocal proponent of greater limits on the power of intelligence agencies to act with limited safeguards under the justification of national security. In October, he urged the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-rights-expert-urges-overhaul-of.php">restructure or eliminate</a> [JURIST report] the existing terrorist &quot;blacklisting&quot; system. In June, he called on the US to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-should-expedite-guantanamo-closure.php">set a concrete deadline</a> [JURIST report] for closure of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, a task <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">accomplished</a> [JURIST report] in January by President Barack Obama. In May, he urged Spain to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/un-expert-urges-spain-to-reform-legal.php">reform its legal standards</a> [JURIST report] for the treatment of suspected terrorists.

		<title>Obama to limit scope of presidential signing statements</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Memorandum-on-Presidential-Signing-Statements/">memorandum</a> [text] Monday that proposes to limit the use of attaching <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/signing.htm">presidential signing statements</a> [1993 DOJ backgrounder] which raise constitutional or other legal questions before bills are signed into law. The memorandum suggested parameters for the disregard of statutory provisions based solely on differences in policy, yet at the same time recognized the need to uphold the historical and legal significance of raising valid constitutional objections.  Obama also noted the public criticism of presidential signing statements generated by the <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] administration, and the memorandum states:<blockquote>To ensure that all signing statements previously issued are followed only when consistent with these principles, executive branch departments and agencies are directed to seek the advice of the Attorney General before relying on signing statements issued prior to the date of this memorandum as the basis for disregarding, or otherwise refusing to comply with, any provision of a statute.</blockquote>In addition, Obama set forth guidelines he will follow when using signing statements, including communicating with Congress when practicable, acting with restraint and caution, clearly and specifically stating objections if they arise, and constructing statutory provisions to avoid constitutional problems only if they are legitimate.<br /><br />A <a href="http://appropriations.senate.gov/News/2007_06_18_Text_of_GAO_Opinion_on_White_House_Signing_Statements.pdf?CFID=9663378&CFTOKEN=77918743">report</a> [text, PDF] issued in 2007 by the US <a href="http://www.gao.gov/">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) [official website] said that Bush&#39;s use of bill signing statements had led to several instances where provisions of laws had been ignored in favor of the Bush administration&#39;s interpretation. Critics of the procedure, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) and ranking Republican member <a href="http://specter.senate.gov/public/">Arlen Specter</a> (R-PA) [official websites] have said that Bush&#39;s signing statements impermissibly intrude upon Congress&#39;s power to write and enact laws under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.table.html#articlei">Article I of the Constitution</a> [text], which vests &quot;[a]ll legislative powers herein granted&quot; in Congress. In 2006, the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/bush-signing-statements-undermine-rule.php">criticized the practice</a> [JURIST report] as undermining congressional authority.

The protesters, led by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6959782.stm">Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>] of the <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website], faced continued raids and arrests from government forces, which began Wednesday when police units <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-police-arrest-lawyers.php">moved against opposition leaders and supporters</a> [JURIST report] ahead of the march and a rally organized by the PML-N and other opposition parties against the Zardari government. Members of the lawyers&#39; movement were harassed by the Pakistani police, including movement leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Muneer+Malik">Muneer Malik</a> [JURIST news archive], who, according to JURIST&#39;s Pakistan correspondent, was arrested and later released on Thursday. Pakistan news organization Dawn has been covering <a href="http://dawntravelshow.com/dblog/?p=286">the march and government actions</a> [Dawn coverage], including the ongoing detentions of opposition figures and supporters as well as the progress of the march towards Islamabad. Some protesters have been <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jllX-ZZ7OjIoClt1P9NmIcMWsyqA">prevented from leaving Karachi</a> [AFP report] by government forces, who have used <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/asia/13pstan.html?ref=asia">force</a> [NYT report] to break up the march and stop the political protest. Lawyers&#39; movement leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=aitzaz+ahsan">Aitzaz Ahsan</a> [JURIST news archive] told Dawn that the movement and the march would only be <a href="http://dawntravelshow.com/dblog/?p=324">inspired to greater opposition</a> [Dawn report] by the government response.<br /><br />The current long march is similar to last year&#39;s demonstrations against the regime of former Pakistan president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pervez+musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive]. The march comes as Pakistan teeters on the edge of political instability following last month&#39;s Supreme Court of Pakistan ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-supreme-court-bars-ex-pm.php">barred Sharif</a> [JURIST report] from holding elected office based on a past criminal conviction. The Supreme Court&#39;s controversial decision followed  continued turmoil over the country&#39;s judiciary, which has split the PML-N and Zardari&#39;s PPP, formerly <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php>coalition partners</a> [JURIST report]. Sharif and the PML-N have urged the restoration of Chief Justice <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry>Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive], ousted after then-president Musharraf declared emergency rule in November 2007. Chaudhry, supported by many members of Pakistan&#39;s bar, <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/01/ousted-pakistan-chief-justice-claims.php>insists he is still chief justice</a> [JURIST report] under the Pakistani <a href=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/>constitution</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.on.ca/scj/en/">Ontario Superior Court</a> [official website] Justice Douglas Rutherford Thursday <a href="http://images.theglobeandmail.com/v5/content/pdf/ReasonsforSentences0312.pdf">sentenced</a> [reasons for sentence, PDF] Ottawa software developer <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/khawaja_mohammad.html">Mohammed Momin Khawaja</a> [CBC profile] to 10.5 years in prison for his involvement in an alleged terrorist plot to bomb targets in the UK. Khawaja was <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/canada-court-convicts-first-suspect.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008 of designing a remote detonator and providing other support to a group that was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/uk-court-sentences-five-to-life-for.php">convicted in 2007</a> [JURIST report] of planning to detonate a large fertilizer bomb. In the sentencing decision, Rutherford wrote:<blockquote>Having found Momin Khawaja guilty as indicated in the Reasons for Judgment ... I have concluded that he should be sentenced to a further term of ten and one-half years in penitentiary. ... <br /><br />I outlined earlier why the sentencing in this case had to emphasize denunciation and repudiation of terrorism, had to punish such behavior, had to have both special and general deterrent impact, and had to protect society at large from the repetition of such misconduct. In light of that and in light of the absence of any indication that Momin Khawaja is in any way repentant for his misdeeds or willing to make amends and commit to future behavior that complies with Canada&#8217;s laws and values, I have really no option but to require that he serve half of the terms of two years or more before being eligible for full parole. That means he will not be eligible for full parole until serving at least 5 of the total of ten and one-half years. To order otherwise would, in my view, fail to adequately serve the interests of the expression of society&#8217;s denunciation of the offences [sic] and the objectives of specific and general deterrence.</blockquote>Khawaja was found guilty of participating in a terrorist group, instructing a person to finance terrorism, making property available to terrorists, contributing to a terrorist group, and facilitating terrorism under Canada&#39;s controversial <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=e&chamber=n&startlist=a&endlist=z&session=9&type=0&scope=i&query=2981&list=toc-1">Anti-Terrorism Act</a> [text; CBC <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/cdnsecurity/">backgrounder</a>]. He was cleared of two other terrorism charges related to his intent to aid in a specific act of terrorism, but was convicted on related criminal charges for possession of and intent to use explosives. In June 2008, Khawaja <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/canada-terror-suspect-pleads-not-guilty.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges and his lawyer said the allegations were exaggerated and based on hearsay evidence that should have been excluded. In 2007, Canadian Federal Court Judge Richard Mosley <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/canada-judge-declines-release-of.php">refused to require the release of confidential evidence</a> [JURIST report] against Khawaja, explaining that &quot;disclosure of most of the information would be injurious to national security or to international relations.&quot; Khawaja was <a href="/paperchase/2004/03/canadians-charge-first-suspect-under.htm">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in March 2004, and was the first person to be charged and tried under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The number of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=employment+discrimination">employment discrimination</a> [JURIST news archive] charges against private employers filed with the US <a href="http://eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] <a href="http://eeoc.gov/press/3-11-09.html">increased by 15 percent in 2008</a> [press release] to reach record highs, according to EEOC <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/charges.html">statistics</a> [materials] released Wednesday. The EEOC cited several possible reasons for the increase, &quot;including economic conditions, increased diversity and demographic shifts in the labor force, employees&#39; greater awareness of the law, EEOC&#39;s focus on systemic litigation, and changes to EEOC&#39;s intake practices.&quot; Of the 95,402 complaints filed with the EEOC in 2008, 35.6 percent covered allegations of racial discrimination, and 29.7 percent were based on alleged sex discrimination. Charges of age discrimination, which comprised only 23.2 percent in 2007, increased to 25.8 percent in 2008, with some experts suggesting that this may be due to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hNRSGCm72odSMrqqQNGkZC9hv_JwD96S2TD00">older workers being disproportionately terminated</a> [AP report] as a result of the recent economic downturn.<br /><br />Last March, the EEOC reported a <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/press/3-5-08.html">9 percent increase</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/eeoc-reports-biggest-jump-in-employment.php">report</a>] in employment discrimination charges for 2007, the biggest annual increase since the early 1990s. In February 2007, the EEOC reported an <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/press/2-1-07.html">increase in discrimination charges for 2006</a> [press release] for the first time since 2002. In February 2006, the EEOC reported that discrimination charges against private employers <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/press/2-9-06.html">declined by five percent in 2005</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/eeoc-reports-decrease-in-employment.php">report</a>], the third straight year the number of complaints fell. EEOC officials pointed to several factors as potential causes of the decrease, including the EEOC&#39;s outreach and prevention efforts as well as a general economic slowdown. The EEOC is charged with enforcing <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/laws.html">federal anti-discrimination laws</a> [EEOC materials] among private employers. The US Department of Justice enforces the federal anti-discrimination statutes for government workers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="/countries/pakistan.php">Pakistan</a> [JURIST news archive] government forces conducted raids and arrested opposition members, including members of the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/magazine/01PAKISTAN-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin">lawyers&#39; movement</a> [NYT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+lawyers+movement">news archive</a>], prior to a protest rally led Wednesday by former prime minister and <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website] leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6959782.stm">Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>]. Among those targeted Tuesday night were lawyers&#39; movement leader <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/punjab/opposition-members-arrested-in-punjab-crackdown--szh">Aitzaz Ahsan</a> [Dawn TV report] and Imran Khan, founder of <a href="http://www.insaf.pk/">Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf</a> (PTI) [party website]. Following the raids, many opposition politicians and party leaders - including Khan, who avoided arrest - <a href="http://www.insaf.pk/News/tabid/60/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1956/Top-PTI-leadership-goes-underground.aspx">went into hiding</a> [PTI press release]. At Wednesday&#39;s rally, Sharif had <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\03\10\story_10-3-2009_pg1_1">harsh words</a> [<em>Daily Times</em> report] for Pakistan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=asif+ali+zardari">news archive</a>], calling on supporters of the opposition parties to <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/news_detail.php?id=1295">take to the streets</a> [PML-N press release] with the party and the lawyers&#39; movement in a march to the capital, reminiscent of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22long+march%22">long march</a> [JURIST news archive] held last summer. Sharif also equated the movements of the Zardari government against opposition members with the conduct of former president and military ruler <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pervez+musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive].<br /><br />The arrests and rally come as Pakistan teeters on the edge of political instability following last month&#39;s Supreme Court of Pakistan ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-supreme-court-bars-ex-pm.php">barred Sharif</a> [JURIST report] from holding elected office based on a past criminal conviction. The Supreme Court&#39;s controversial decision followed  continued turmoil over the country&#39;s judiciary, which has split the PML-N and Zardari&#39;s <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> (PPP) [party website], formerly <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php>coalition partners</a> [JURIST report]. Sharif and the PML-N have urged the restoration of Chief Justice <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry>Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive], ousted after then-president Musharraf declared emergency rule in November 2007. Chaudhry, supported by many members of Pakistan&#39;s bar, <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2009/01/ousted-pakistan-chief-justice-claims.php>insists he is still chief justice</a> [JURIST report] under the Pakistani <a href=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/>constitution</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkish police on Tuesday arrested 56 people charged with plotting to overthrow the ruling <a href="http://eng.akparti.org.tr/english/index.html">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website], including two retired generals. They were <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2009/03/10/europe/OUKWD-UK-TURKEY-PLOT.php">arrested</a> [Reuters report] after the Istanbul prosecutor issued an indictment linking them to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder] group case.

The BTRC<a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jzCwlKr9-eOzmC5obIgZapb9rDxw"> blocked several websites</a> [AFP report] Sunday on government instructions that identified them as subversive or detrimental to the administration because the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpmr4gKFHww">audio</a> [YouTube clip, part 1 in Bangla; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWI3Ybe2hfs&feature=related">part 2</a>, in Bangla] of the meeting could be distributed through them. BTRC Director Ziaul Islam told AFP Thursday that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/about">YouTube</a> [corporate website] has been restored even though the audio is still available because <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25177038-12377,00.html">tensions over the content have eased</a> [AFP report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv2348-97">dismissed</a> [order, PDF] a lawsuit by Saudi <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee Ghassan Abdullah al-Sharbi that challenged his confinement based on a <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2005cv2348-97-1">request</a> [text, PDF] from al-Sharbi himself. According to al-Sharbi&#39;s attorney, Judge Emmet Sullivan made the decision <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/10/AR2009031001380.html">after a private hearing</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] conducted Friday through a video link with the prison. Sullivan wrote:<blockquote>While the Court may certainly question the wisdom of abandoning a legal challenge to a detention that has lasted seven years without trial, the Court cannot say that Mr. Al Sharbi is incompetent or is making the decision to withdraw the pending habeas petition involuntarily and unknowingly. Mr. Al Sharbi was able to articulate to the Court his own reasons for wishing to proceed in this manner. The Court cannot say that these reasons are based on incompetence, mental infirmity, or the result of threat or coercion.</blockquote>The dismissal was without prejudice and would not bar al-Sharbi from bringing suit again.<br /><br />Al-Sharbi was <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104sharbi.pdf">initially charged</a> [DOD charge sheet, PDF] with conspiracy for his alleged involvement with al Qaeda. At a pre-trial hearing in 2006, al-Sharbi <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/guantanamo-detainee-tells-military.php">denied war-crime allegations</a> [JURIST report] but admitted to fighting against the United States. The charges were thrown out when the Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-rules.php">report</a>] in 2006 that the military commission system as initially constituted violated US and international law.  Congress subsequently passed the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsacts.html">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> [DOD materials], which established the current military commissions system. Al-Sharbi was <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/pentagon-files-new-charges-against-3.php">charged again</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 with a new conspiracy charge and for providing material support for terrorism. The charges against him were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">later dismissed without prejudice</a> [JURIST report] although he remained in custody awaiting a decision on being recharged.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] German prosecutors announced Wednesday that they have filed charges against former Nazi concentration camp guard and Ohio resident <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/327/000045192/">John Demjanjuk</a> [NNDB profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=demjanjuk">news archive</a>]. Demjanjuk is <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_GERMANY_DEMJANJUK?SITE=WVEC&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">charged with 29,000 counts of accessory to murder</a> [AP report] for his alleged involvement at the <a href="http://www.deathcamps.info/new_page_2.htm">Sobibor</a> [Death Camps backgrounder] concentration camp, where more than 260,000 people were executed in the gas chambers. A former Soviet solider, Demanjuk is <a href="http://www.abendzeitung.de/muenchen/92205">accused of volunteering to work at Sobidor</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Abendzeitung</span> report, in German] following his capture by Germans. He allegedly worked at Sobidor for much of its existence, from March to September 1943. The German government will now seek Demanjuk&#39;s extradition from the US.    <br /><br />Demjanjuk has fought a lengthy legal battle over his alleged involvement with Nazi death camps during World War II. In May 2008, the US Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/orders-mon-05-19.pdf">Demjanjuk v. Mukasey</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-supreme-court-rejects-appeal-of.php">report</a>], ending the appeals process for his deportation order. Demajanjuk was appealing a <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/us-judge-orders-deportation-of-accused.php">2005 ruling</a> [JURIST report] by then-US Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy ordering his deportation. Demjanjuk had previously lost an appeal to the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/eoir/biainfo.htm">Board of Immigration Appeals</a> [DOJ backgrounder]. The US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Demjanjuk&#39;s <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/08a0054p-06.pdf">petition for review</a> [PDF text] in January 2008. In 1988, Demjanjuk was convicted and sentenced to death by an Israeli court which found that he was a notorious guard from Treblinka nicknamed &quot;Ivan the Terrible.&quot; The sentence was vacated by the Israeli Supreme Court in 1993, and Demjanjuk returned to the US.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/index.asp">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French] on Tuesday began considering a <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/internet.asp">bill</a> [materials, in French] that would allow the government to shut off internet access for those who repeatedly share or download copyrighted music and movies illegally. The bill, supported by French <a href="http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/ministre07.htm">Minister of Culture Christine Albanel</a> [official profile, in French] and passed by the country&#39;s Senate in October 2008, has been <a href="http://www.edri.org/edri-gram/number7.4/hadopi-law-france">criticized</a> [EDRI release] by consumer and rights groups who say it infringes on civil liberties and could lead to wholesale internet surveillance. Consumer group UFC-Que Choisir urged Assembly members to <a href="http://www.quechoisir.org/communiques/La-ligne-gouvernementale-c-est-la-ligne-Maginot/F8F72336B63491A8C12575740038BE35.htm">reject the bill</a> [press release, in French], arguing that most illegal downloading could be stopped by the creation of subscription-based services that give consumers better legal access to copyrighted materials.<br /><br />Other countries have also been struggling with how to balance protecting copyrighted material on the internet with privacy concerns. In December, the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/aboutus.php">Recording Industry Association of America</a>&nbsp;[association website]&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/12/riaa-abandons-lawsuits-for-filesharing.php">dropped</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] a number of lawsuits against illegal file-sharers after some of the defendants<a href="/paperchase/2008/03/riaa-facing-racketeering-fraud-spying.php"> counter-sued the association</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] for tactics it used to track their internet use. In January 2008, the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">European Court of Justice</a>&nbsp;[official website]&nbsp;<a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?where=&lang=en&num=79919870C19060275&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET">held</a> [judgment; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/eu-court-rules-identity-of-file-sharers.php">report</a>] that telecommunication companies operating in Spain were not obligated to disclose the identities of internet users suspected of illegal file sharing. In July 2007, a Belgium court ordered a file sharing website to <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/belgium-court-orders-isp-to-prevent.php">filter or block access</a> [JURIST report] to users sharing copyrighted material.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cpa-iraq.org/regulations/20040422_CPAORD_13_Revised_Amended.pdf">Central Criminal Court of Iraq</a> (CCCI) [establishment order, PDF] on Thursday sentenced <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7787792.stm">Muntadar al-Zaidi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-Zaidi">news archive</a>], the Iraqi journalist accused of throwing his shoes at former US president George W. Bush, to three years in prison for assaulting a foreign leader. The verdict came after a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/iraq-court-postpones-trial-of-shoe.php">three week postponement</a> [JURIST report] during which the court considered arguments from al-Zaidi&#39;s counsel that Bush&#39;s visit was not official and that the assault charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, should not apply because al-Zaidi sought to insult but not injure the US president. Al-Zaidi pleaded innocent Thursday, calling his actions a natural response to the US presence in Iraq. The court rejected his arguments, ruling that Bush&#39;s visit was official and opting to sentence al-Zaidi under the assault charge rather than a lesser charge of insulting a foreign leader that is punishable by a maximum of three years. Al-Zaidi&#39;s defense team said Thursday that he will appeal the verdict, and also indicated that he <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i2JpIx2rJGrUhQVecW20yn8_dOAg">may file suit internationally</a> [AFP report] for <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-judge-orders-investigation-into.php">human rights violations committed against him while in custody</a> [JURIST report].  <br /><br />Al-Zaidi&#39;s trial was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraq-court-delays-trial-of-shoe.php">initially delayed</a> [JURIST report] in December so the court could make a determination of the charges. The trial has been opposed for failing to meet international standards of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/12/14/quality-justice">due process and fairness</a> [HRW report] and has been protested by Iraqis. The shoe-throwing incident occurred at a December 14 <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html">joint news conference</a> [transcript] at which Bush and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4932468.stm">Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki</a> [BBC profile] signed a <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/20081119_SOFA_FINAL_AGREED_TEXT.pdf">Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA) [text, PDF; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/16448/us_security_agreements_and_iraq.html">backgrounder</a>] governing the future US military presence in the country. Al-Zaidi, who had allegedly suffered brutality first hand in Iraq having been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/14/AR2008121401170.html?hpid=topnews">kidnapped and released by Shiite militiamen in 2007</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report], testified to a three-judge panel that his actions were meant to restore Iraqi citizens&#39; pride.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US financier <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court to all 11 <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf">charges of securities fraud</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">report</a>]. The plea was entered at a hearing before Judge Denny Chin of the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website]. Victims of Madoff&#39;s alleged multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme are expected to testify at the hearing later Thursday. Chin will then <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/business/13madoff.html?_r=1&hp">rule on whether Madoff should be allowed to continue to remain free on bail</a> [NYT report]. Thursday&#39;s hearing is the first time Madoff has spoken publicly about the allegations facing him. Prosecutors are seeking a 150-year sentence, but a sentence is not expected for several months.<br /><br />Last month, Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/madoff-reaches-agreement-with-sec-on.php">consented</a> [JURIST report] to a <a href="http://sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20889.htm">partial judgment</a> [SEC press release] with the US <a href="http://sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] over civil charges brought by the SEC to obtain a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against him. The same day, SEC Division of Enforcement Director Linda Thomsen announced she was <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-22.htm">stepping down from her post</a> [SEC press release]. In the week following Madoff&#39;s charges, SEC Chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Christopher Cox</a> [official profile] said that he would <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-297.htm">launch an immediate investigation</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-launching-investigation-of-failure.php">report</a>] into how the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Madoff went undetected for so long. In December, then-President-elect <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president-elect_obama_names_key_regulatory_appointments/">named</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/Leadership/p009733">Mary Schapiro</a> [professional profile] as the SEC Chairman, replacing Cox. Madoff was charged with securities fraud in December for allegedly violating the anti-fraud provisions of the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/33Act/">Securities Act of 1933</a>, the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/index.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>, and the <a href="http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/InvAdvAct/index.html">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a> [texts].<br /><br />11:25 AM - Chin has ordered Madoff to be remanded in custody until his sentencing hearing June 16, effectively revoking his bail. He is expected to be held at Manhattan&#39;s <a href="http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/nym/index.jsp">Metropolitan Correctional Center</a> [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo1_6308/curia">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] ruled Tuesday that an unpublished list of items prohibited from airplanes <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&num=79909689C19060345&doc=T&ouvert=T&seance=ARRET&indlink=5">does not have any binding effect on individuals</a> [decision; <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/en/actu/communiques/cp09/aff/cp090020en.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] unless it is made public. The list is set out in an annex to <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:089:0009:0010:EN:PDF">Regulation 622/2003</a> [text, PDF], but under Article 3 of that regulation is made available only to &quot;persons duly authorised [sic] by a Member State or the Commission.&quot; The court found that because the regulation imposes obligations on individuals, <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12006E254:EN:HTML">Article 254</a> [text] of the Treaty Establishing the European Community requires that it be published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Official Journal of the European Union</span> before it takes effect. The court also found that a list prohibiting carry-on items was not within the scope of Article 8 of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:355:0001:0021:EN:PDF">Regulation 2320/2002</a> [text, PDF], which outlines the confidentiality of civil aviation security procedures. The case was brought by an Austrian who was thrown off of a plane in Vienna after refusing to surrender his tennis racquets.<br /><br />The EU passed Regulation 2320/2002 outlining EU-wide security requirements in the wake of the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. These general security procedures have been modified to reflect emerging concerns, including a 2004 amendment to the secret prohibited items list. Despite privacy concerns, Europe has been moving closer to implementing a <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/eu-moves-closer-to-adopting-plane.php">passenger data-sharing system</a> [JURIST report], announced as part of a <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/eu-justice-chief-unveils-new-anti.php">package of anti-terrorism measures</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/frattini/webroot/profile/default_en.htm">EU Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security Franco Frattini</a> [official profile] in November 2007. In July, the EU and US <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/us-eu-sign-new-agreement-on-passenger.php">reached a new agreement on passenger data-sharing</a> [JURIST report] under which air carriers will transmit passenger data directly to the US Department of Homeland Security within 15 minutes of a European flight&#39;s departure for the US.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Italian government on Tuesday asked the country&#39;s <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/versioni_in_lingua/english_version.asp">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] to dismiss kidnapping charges against US and Italian intelligence officers, arguing that  allowing the case to go forward would harm the country&#39;s national security interests. The case involves 26 Americans being tried <font style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</font> and five former Italian intelligence officials charged in the 2003 abduction and <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] of Egyptian cleric <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nasr+egyptian+cleric">Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Constitutional Court is <a href="http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-03-10_110349692.html">now hearing the case</a> [ANSA report] in closed sessions after <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/italy-court-again-suspends-cia.php">suspending the case</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] for three months in order to allow the government and prosecutors to prepare arguments on the national security issues. Both <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3034600.stm">Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=berlusconi">news archive</a>] and his predecessor, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6387715.stm">former Prime Minister Romano Prodi</a> [BBC profile], have warned that certain evidence collected by the prosecution could jeopardize future collaboration between Italian and US spy services. Prosecutor Armando Spataro has accused Berlusconi, ex-Italian military intelligence agency chief Niccolo Pollari, and others of inflating security arguments to obstruct justice. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule on whether the case can go forward later this week.<br /><br />Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt&#39;s State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. Defense lawyers for Pollari have said they need Italian agents&#39; testimony and classified government documents to assert their defense that Pollari was not involved in the kidnapping. Last May, Magi ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/italty-court-rules-berlusconi-can-be.php">Berlusconi can be called to testify</a> [JURIST report].

Aziz and al-Majid, the cousin of Saddam Hussein better known as &quot;Chemical Ali,&quot; were among eight defendants on trial for the murders, which were committed after a summary trial of the 42 merchants, who were not given a chance to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/11/AR2009031100741.html">appeal or defend themselves</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] against the charges. Two other cousins of Hussein were sentenced to death in the case, three defendants were sentenced to prison terms, and one man was acquitted of all charges.<br /><br />The sentences handed down against Aziz and al-Majid come nearly one week after Aziz was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-gives-chemical-ali-third.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] of charges and al-Majid received a third death sentence in connection with the killing of protesters who <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/marsharabs1.htm">rioted</a> [HRW backgrounder] in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr - father of anti-American cleric <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/7637/">Muqtada al-Sadr</a> [CFR profile] - by Hussein agents. The trial against the eight defendants accused in the merchant killings <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/iraq-high-tribunal-opens-trial-of.php">began</a> [JURIST report] last April.

Pillay on Friday cited &quot;credible sources&quot; for the stated number of civilian deaths and said, &quot;certain actions being undertaken by the Sri Lankan military and by the LTTE may constitute violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.&quot; Sri Lankan Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/Ministries_2007/Min_disaster_mgmt_human_rights.html">Mahinda Samarsinghe</a> [official profile] <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-38506720090314?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">said the numbers were unconfirmed</a> [Reuters report] and expressed dismay that Pillay was relying on numbers corresponding to those on the website <a href="http://www.tamilnet.com/">TamilNet</a> [advocacy website], which is maintained by the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government has also refused to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gVoaDFmbCYS-Usz9ACDRIengj21QD96TQR3G0">hold cease-fire negotiations with the LTTE</a> [AP report], as it believes it is close to ending the country&#39;s 25 year <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/country_profiles/1166237.stm">civil war</a> [BBC timeline] that has resulted in over 70,000 deaths. <br /><br />Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/srilanka0209web_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-accuses-sri-lanka-and.php">report</a>] alleging that both the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE are guilty of human rights violations. Earlier this year,  Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/7C48F59856B2A8BCC125754D003C5D24?opendocument">condemned</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] the deteriorating conditions of those trapped in the Vanni region, and called for investigations and prosecutions for the killings and other human rights abuses. HRW has repeatedly accused both sides of violations, and since 2007 has also criticized the government&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/sri-lanka-should-halt-internment-of.php">de facto internment centers</a> and its role in the increase in <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/sri-lanka-government-rights-abuses-on.php">unlawful killings and other human rights violations</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of <a href="http://www.admin.ch/">Switzerland</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=switzerland">news archive</a>] said Friday it will <a href="http://www.admin.ch/aktuell/00089/index.html?lang=en&msg-id=25863">follow standards</a> [press release] set by the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3305,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> (OECD) [official website], adopting a more stringent definition of tax evasion and agreeing to cooperate with other countries in evasion investigations. Unlike many other countries, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/business/worldbusiness/14tax.html?em">Switzerland differentiates between tax fraud and tax evasion</a> [NY Times report], and tax evasion is not a crime. While this policy has not changed, by adopting the definition of tax evasion under Article 26 of the <a href="www.oecd.org/dataoecd/52/34/1914467.pdf">OECD Model Tax Convention</a> [text, PDF] Switzerland will henceforward share information &quot;with other countries in individual cases where a specific and justified request has been made.&quot; The Swiss government also made clear that by adopting the OECD definition it was not ending bank secrecy. A <a href="http://www.admin.ch/aktuell/00089/index.html?lang=en&msg-id=25889">statement</a> [press release] by the Federal Department of Finance on Saturday said that while the situation for non-resident foreigners has changed, the &quot;decision will have no bearing on legally resident foreigners in Switzerland.&quot;<br /><br />Owners of Swiss bank accounts have traditionally enjoyed great privacy, but Swiss banks have recently released information on certain clients. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.ubs.com/">UBS</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2009-03-04-ubs-us-bank-clients_N.htm?csp=23&RM_Exclude=aol">closed more than 14,000 accounts</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report} owned by US citizens following a court settlement over accusations it assisted its clients with tax evasion.  In 2006, the <a href="http://www.ofj.admin.ch/bj/en/home.html">Swiss Justice Ministry</a> [official website] granted US investigators <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/switzerland-to-give-us-prosecutors.php">access to information</a> [JURIST report] about bank accounts of terrorism suspects.  Prosecutors in the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/vae/">US Attorney&#39;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] requested the information in a four-year old investigation into money laundering to support terrorist activities.  Earlier the same year, the Swiss Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/swiss-court-denies-russian-request-for.php">denied a Russian request</a> [JURIST report] for the transfer of bank documents to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=russia">Russia</a> [JURIST news archive] which were relevant to an ongoing investigation into Russian oil giant <a href="http://www.yukos.com/">Yukos</a> [corporate website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/yukos.php">news archive</a>].

The two activists, Yang Zili and Zhang Yonghai, were <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/press?revision_id=27167&item_id=11379">sentenced</a> [HRIC report] to prison along with two other activists in 2003 for <a href="">&quot;subversion of state power&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] and &quot;attempting to overthrow the Communist Party&quot; after publishing online essays advocating political reform and rural democratization. After their release, Yang and Zhang will be subject to a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5giTztR3Q-N_HzD1QpNL4ecZgMQEAD96TMLPO0">two-year ban</a> [AP report] on unauthorized communication with Western journalists, and prevented from gathering with other dissidents. Yang nonetheless participated in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/world/asia/14beijing.html?ref=asia">interview</a> [NYT report] with the <em>New York Times</em> Friday in Beijing, in apparent contravention of the ban. According to HRIC, all four of the dissidents, including the two who remain imprisoned, Xu Wei and Jin Haike, have complained of harsh treatment and intolerable living conditions in Chinese prisons.<br /><br />China&#39;s official <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/">Communist Party</a> [official website] has been <a href="http://thereport.amnesty.org/document/60">criticized by rights groups</a> [AI report, PDF; HRIC <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/">advocacy website</a>] for its treatment of emerging opposition parties. Several prominent counterrevolutionaries have been imprisoned, including <a href="http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/1820/prmID/172">Hu Shigen</a> [PEN profile], who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/china-releases-political-activist-after.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in August after serving 16 years. In June 2008, the US State Department said in its annual <a href="http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/afdr/2008/104760.htm">Advancing Freedom and Democracy Reports</a> [text] that China &quot;continued to deny its citizens basic democratic rights, and law enforcement authorities suppressed those perceived to threaten the legitimacy or authority of the Chinese Communist Party,&quot; charges which the Chinese government <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xwfw/s2510/t443011.htm">called &quot;denial of reality and utterly groundless.&quot;</a> [official statement; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/china-official-denounces-us-human.php">report</a>].

In a ceremony on part of the land seized by the government from large owners, Morales turned over about 94,000 acres to Guarani Indians. Morales criticized the treatment of workers on large farms and asked wealthy landowners to embrace equality by voluntarily giving up some of their holdings. The original landowners can appeal the redistribution to the <a href="http://tan.poderjudicial.gov.bo/">National Agrarian Tribunal</a> [official website].<br /><br />Bolivia&#39;s new constitution <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/new-bolivia-constitution-takes-effect.php">went into effect</a> [JURIST report] in February, after being <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/bolivia-approves-constitutional.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by national referendum in January.

Eighteen Serbs were originally charged over the incident. Charges against two were later dropped.  Fourteen of the men were <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/serb-court-convicts-14-serbs-for.php">found guilty of war crimes in late 2005</a>, but in 2006 Serbia&#39;s Supreme Court vacated that verdict and <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/serbia-high-court-orders-retrial-in.php">ordered a retrial</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] German <a href="http://www.blogger.com/BBC%20profile%20http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4572387.stm">Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [BBC profile] said in a <a href="http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/idw_dlf/934483/">radio interview</a> [transcript, in German] Sunday that the German government must more strictly enforce its gun-control laws. Merkel&#39;s comments came <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g-7Dbm7W0ADoXhfKS2O_sUrZu4NwD96UHC401">less than a week</a> after 17-year-old Tim Kretschmer <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g-7Dbm7W0ADoXhfKS2O_sUrZu4NwD96S47T01">shot and killed 16 people</a> [AP reports] in southern Germany. Authorities believe Kretschmer obtained the gun he used in the shooting from an unsecured place in his parents&#39; house. Under German law, stored guns must be <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4098492,00.html">locked</a> [DW report] in safes. Merkel asked parents and educators to be vigilant in keeping guns out of children&#39;s hands and mentioned the possibility of random checks to make sure weapons are properly stored. <br /><br />Interior Minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/609068.stm">Wolfgang Schaeuble</a> [BBC profile] said last week that tightening Germany&#39;s gun-control laws would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLC958278">not eliminate youth gun violence</a> [Reuters report]. Schaeuble called Germany&#39;s gun-control laws among the world&#39;s <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-38516620090315?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0">strictest</a> [Reuters report]. In 2002, one house of Germany&#39;s parliament <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/26/germany.guns/">adopted a measure</a> [CNN report] that required airgun owners to be licensed. That same day, a 19-year-old gunman shot and killed 17 people in Erfurt, though the shooting and legislation did not appear to be related. The German Police Union has said Germany&#39;s gun-control laws have not been properly enforced. Lawyers have said Kretschmer&#39;s <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/international/shinternational/display.var.2495522.0.0.php">father could be liable</a> [<font class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Sunday Herald</font> report] if it is shown he improperly stored the gun that Kretschmer eventually used in the shooting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">US Senate</a> [official website] on Thursday confirmed <a href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/david_ogden/">David Ogden</a> [professional profile; Senate <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/nominations/DeputyAttorneyGeneral-DavidOgden.cfm">materials</a>] as the new Deputy Attorney General by a vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00097">65-28</a> [roll call]. In debate Wednesday, Republicans opposed to the nomination focused on Ogden&#39;s actions while serving in the private sector, where he defended groups who actively opposed anti-pornography and pre-abortion prenatal notification laws. Before the vote, <a href="http://leahy.senate.gov/">Senator Patrick Leahy</a> (D-VT) [official website] urged colleagues not to characterize Ogden by his clients:<blockquote>Nominees from both Republican and Democratic administrations and Senators from both sides of the aisle have cautioned against opposing nominees based on their legal representations on behalf of clients. Like many others in this Chamber, I felt privileged to serve as a prosecutor, but I would hate to think I could not have served in that position because, before I was a prosecutor, I defended people who were accused of crimes. I was a lawyer. I wanted to make sure clients were given equal protection of the law. If we start singling out somebody because of their clients, what do you do? Do you say to this person: You defended somebody charged with murder and therefore you are in favor of murder?</blockquote> Ogden <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/deputy-ag-nominee-ogden-defends.php">faced questions about his clients</a> [JURIST report] in confirmation hearings last month.  <br /><br />Ogden was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-appoints-clinton-era-lawyers-to.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] as Deputy Attorney General in January by then President-elect Barack Obama.  He was previously in private practice with the law firm <a href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/">WilmerHale</a> [firm website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Wireless communications company <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm</a> [corporate website] <a href="http://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2009/090316_Federal_Court_Dismisses_Broadcom_Complaint.html">announced</a> [press release] Monday that the <a href="http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/index.php?page=home">US District Court for the Southern District of California</a> [official website] has <a href="/pdf/qualcommorder.pdf">dismissed</a> [order, PDF] a lawsuit against it by longtime corporate rival <a href="http://www.broadcom.com/">Broadcom</a> [corporate website] asking the court to declare several Qualcomm patents exhausted and unenforceable. In the order issued Thursday, Judge William Hayes held that Broadcom&#39;s complaint lacked grounds for relief based on a failure to list the particular patents that were allegedly exhausted. Broadcom also failed to identify sales or licenses which would have triggered the exhaustion of Qualcomm&#39;s patents. The court also found Broadcom&#39;s purported injuries were too speculative to warrant declaratory relief. Hayes wrote:<blockquote>The Court has considered the totality of the circumstances and concludes that the Complaint does not allege a controversy of &quot;sufficient immediacy andreality to warrant the issuance&quot; of a far-reaching declaratory judgment premised on a finding that Qualcomm&#8217;s unidentified patents that are embodied in wireless chipsets and handsets are exhausted.</blockquote>Broadcom filed this federal lawsuit against Qualcomm in 2008. The Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-937.pdf">Quanta v. LG Electronics</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-false-claims-act.php">report</a>], an antitrust case in which the Court held that the sale of a patent triggers exhaustion, precipitated Broadcom&#39;s decision to seek declaratory relief against Qualcomm. This decision is only the latest in a long series of legal battles between the two corporations. In December, the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1545.pdf">affirmed in part a holding against Qualcomm</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/federal-circuit-rules-on-qualcomm.php">report</a>] on the basis of patent holdup. In September, the federal appeals court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssWirelessTelecommunicationServices/idUSN2445263020080924">affirmed an injunction against Qualcomm</a> [Reuters report] on the basis of their alleged infringement of two Broadcom patents.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of 16 human rights investigators and judges &quot;shocked to the core&quot; by the events during the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/2001/israel_and_the_palestinians/default.stm">most recent Gaza conflict</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">news archive</a>] have called for a full investigation of possible violations of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Conventions</a> [link to texts] in an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.nz/archived_news/experts_seek_gaza_inquiry+">open letter</a> [text] addressed to UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ban+ki-moon">news archive</a>] and all members of the UN Security Council. The signatories to the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Amnesty+International">news archive</a>] supported letter include <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1984/tutu-bio.html">Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a> [Nobel profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Tutu">news archive</a>], former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/hchr/unhc.htm">Mary Robinson</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mary+Robinson">news archive</a>] and South African Justice <a href="http://www.un.org/News/dh/iraq/richard_goldstone.htm">Richard Goldstone</a> [official profile]. They said:<blockquote>As individuals with direct experience of international justice and reconciliation of conflict, we believe there is an important case to be made for an international investigation of gross violations of the laws of war, committed by all parties to the Gaza conflict. Without setting the record straight in a credible and impartial manner, it will be difficult for those communities that have borne the heavy cost of violence to move beyond the terrible aftermath of conflict and help build a better peace.</blockquote>AI called for an arms embargo on Israel and Hamas following the release of a UN report detailing the use by both parties of foreign-made weapons. Several other investigations into the Gaza conflict are pending. Earlier in March, Iran announced that it would seek <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iran-to-seek-interpol-arrest-warrants.php">INTERPOL arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Israeli war crimes suspects. In January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D78B7DAC697D3060C1257539003B5F3A?opendocument">called for an independent investigation</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-head-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] of possible war crimes and human rights violations in Gaza. <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is also <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/palestinian-leaders-urge-icc.php">attempting to gain jurisdiction over Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its actions in Gaza for alleged war crimes. Israel has already <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/israel-pm-asks-justice-minister-to.php">begun to consider defenses against possible war crimes charges</a>, partly based on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">accusations</a> [JURIST reports] that it used white phosphorus in a civilian area.

Under the terms of the deal, the government would fully reinstate the as-yet-unrestored judges ousted in November 2007 by then-president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pervez+musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive] and would <a href="http://www.geo.tv/3-14-2009/37333.htm">file an appeal</a> [GEO TV report] of a recent Supreme Court ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-supreme-court-bars-ex-pm.php">barred</a> [JURIST report] former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6959782.stm">Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>] of the <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website] and his brother from holding elected office based on prior criminal convictions arising out of the 1999 military coup that overthrew him.  <br /><br />The current long march, which began amid <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-police-arrest-lawyers.php">preemptive arrests and government violence</a> [JURIST report] against opposition members, is similar to last year&#39;s lawyers&#39; demonstrations against the Musharraf regime. Continuing turmoil over the country&#39;s judiciary split the PML-N and Zardari&#39;s PPP, formerly <a href=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/08/pakistan-coalition-dissolves-due-to.php>coalition partners</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.tesev.org.tr/default.asp?PAG00_CODE=ANATR">Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation</a> (Tesev) [foundation website, in Turkish] <a href="http://www.tesev.org.tr/UD_OBJS/PDF/DEMP/AH/VakifRapor10_03_09.pdf">issued a report</a> [text, PDF, in Turkish] Saturday saying that despite recent attempts by the country to broaden property rights for religious minorities, it still falls short of requirements to <a href="http://www.abgs.gov.tr/?p=1&l=2">join the European Union</a> [accession website]. The majority Muslim country had long <a href="http://www.rightsagenda.org/main.php?id=32&lg=en">confiscated the property of non-Muslim religious foundations</a> [HRAA backgrounder], but has in recent years decreased restrictions on minority and foreign property ownership, and in 2008 <a href="http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=11645">enacted legislation</a> [AsiaNews report] providing for the return of some of the confiscated property. Despite these improvements, Tesev said that Turkey has not implemented a fair system to handle returns, and still heavily restricts the ability of minority foundations to acquire new property.<br /><br />Property rights of minorities is one of several issues that Turkey has recently been addressing in efforts to join the EU. In October 2008, the <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/general/">Constitutional Court of Turkey</a> [official website, in Turkish] <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/eskisite/KARARLAR/IPTALITIRAZ%5CK2008%5C/K-2008-116.htm">struck down</a> [text, in Turkish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkish-constitutional-court-publishes.php">report</a>] an amendment to its <a href="http://www.byegm.gov.tr/mevzuat/anayasa/anayasa-ing.htm">constitution</a> [text; <a href="http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/english.htm">materials</a>] which would have allowed the wearing of headscarves in universities, after the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/european-rights-court-upholds-turkish.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the ban. The court also <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkish-constitutional-court-rejects.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/dnp-turkey.php">bid to ban</a> [JURIST report] the country&#39;s ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Islamic Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish], a decision praised by EU officials.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website]&nbsp;characterized CIA tactics used against terrorism suspects as constituting torture in&nbsp;a confidential 2007 report, according an <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22530">article</a> [text; <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/danner-blacksites.pdf">press release</a>] published in the <font style="font-style:italic;">New York Review of Books</font> earlier this month. Author <a href="http://www.markdanner.com/">Mark Danner</a> [personal website] wrote that he was able to obtain a copy of the report, originally intended for CIA general counsel John Rizzo, in which the ICRC drew conclusions on detainee treatment based on interviews with fourteen so-called &quot;high-valued&quot; detainees. Danner wrote that ICRC&#39;s report included detailed accounts of&nbsp;waterboarding, sleep deprivation, prolonged nudity, and cold water immersion, and that the ICRC found the detainees accounts to be consistent enough to be considered reliable. He quoted the ICRC as concluding that the treatment of the detainees constituted torture:<blockquote>&#39;The allegations of ill-treatment of the detainees indicate that, in many cases, the ill-treatment to which they were subjected while held in the CIA program, either singly or in combination, constituted torture. In addition, many other elements of the ill-treatment, either singly or in combination, constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.&#39;</blockquote>Reports issued by the ICRC <a href="http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/confidentiality-interview-010608">are almost always confidential</a> [ICRC backgrounder], but the group has reserved the right to publish findings under certain circumstances. The ICRC has a formal mandate under the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions">Geneva Conventions</a> [ICRC materials] to visit prisoners of war and inspect the conditions of their detention.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the CIA admitted to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">destroying 92 tapes</a> of interrogations of the &quot;high-value&quot; detainees, later admitting that <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/destroyed-cia-interrogation-tapes.php">12 of the destroyed tapes</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] included evidence of &quot;Enhanced Interrogation Techniques&quot; (EIT). Rights groups and experts on torture have <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=us+torture">long criticized</a> [JURIST news archive] the US for its use of EIT, and US President Barack Obama in January issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-issues-torture-ban-orders-cia.php">report</a>] explicitly banning the use of waterboarding and other techniques that do no comport with Geneva Convention safeguards for prisoners of war.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Rights activists in <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=kenya">Kenya</a> [JURIST news archive] have faced threats since the release in February of a <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/52DF4BE7194A7598C125756800539D79?opendocument">UN report</a> [text] accusing the government of widespread extrajudicial executions, prompting some to <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jyYapft3vQHRnc6jjdIUuZP5V_OAD96TT5H81">leave the country or go into hiding</a> [AP report], according to AP Saturday. Western Kenya activists have reportedly been followed by intelligence agents and have received harassing phone calls. Job Bwonya of <a href="http://www.frontlinedefenders.net/node/1710">Western Kenya Human Rights Watch</a> [backgrounder] decided to flee to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=uganda">Uganda</a> [JURIST news archive] after government officials demanded that he give them a list of witnesses he arranged to be interviewed for the report. By AP&#39;s count, four activists have left the country, and 10 have gone underground.<br /><br />In his report on on extra-judicial killings in Kenya, UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/executions/index.htm">Philip Alston</a> [official website; JURIST news archive] said killings by the police were &quot;systematic, widespread and carefully planned&quot; and that they were committed with &quot;utter impunity.&quot; Earlier this month, Alston <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/kenya-rights-activist-killings-must-be.php">called for an independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the killings of Kenyan rights activists <a href="http://oscarfound.org/founder.html">Oscar Kamau Kingara</a> [advocacy profile] and John Paul Oulu. Last week, Kenyan Prime Minister <a href="http://www.primeminister.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=92:pm-pr&catid=90:the-pm&Itemid=113">Raila Odinga</a> [official profile, BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7068055.stm">profile</a>] announced that <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] agents from the <a href="http://nairobi.usembassy.gov/index.html">US Embassy in Nairobi</a> [official website] would <a href="http://www.primeminister.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=413:the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-fbi-to-unravel-the-recent-shooting-of-two-members-of-the-civil-society-organizations&catid=1:latest-news&Itemid=84">assist in investigating</a> [press release] the killing of the two men.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The number of immigrants detained by the US has drastically increased over the last decade, according to an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j13P7QBc_QTYx0vi9mlryJ1-WUdwD96US8LO0">AP report</a> [text] issued Sunday. A US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=immigration+and+customs+enforcement">news archive</a>] database, obtain by the AP through the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &sect; 552; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=freedom+of+information+act">news archive</a>], indicates that on January 25, 32,000 individuals were detained in the US. This is nearly five times the 6,785 that were detained in 1994. The report also highlights the extended period of time that individuals have faced detention. The ICE estimates that the average detention period is 31 days, but the report indicates that nearly 10,000 detainees have been in custody for longer. There are 18,690 immigrants that are currently in US custody who have no criminal record, 400 of whom have been detained for more than one year. According to the report, 58 percent of the detainees do not have lawyers. The lack of representation has exacerbated some of the issues, including determining whether the ICE follows the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] 2001 ruling in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-7791.ZS.html">Zadvydas v. Davis</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that the ICE has six months to release or deport immigrants after their cases have been decided. The report indicated that 950 people are currently detained past this deadline. The ICE defends the detention system because it is the most effective way to ensure that individuals will appear before the court.<br /><br />Last month, the ICE&#39;s tactics during the Bush administration were <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/bush-immigration-enforcement-policies.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by the Cardozo School of Law&#39;s <a href="http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/MemberContentDisplay.aspx?ccmd=ContentDisplay&ucmd=UserDisplay&userid=84&contentid=7356">Immigration Justice Clinic</a> [official website] for being overly-aggressive and ineffective. Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1233353528835.shtm">directive</a> [text] in January calling for review and assessment of the ICE fugitive operation teams. The ICE has <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/hundreds-of-suspected-illegal-aliens.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] many non-criminal illegal immigrants in the past year, many of whom were <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/hundreds-of-illegal-immigrants.php">imprisoned</a> [JURIST report]. In April, Seton Hall Law School&#39;s Center for Social Justice <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/04/lawsuit_claims_immigration_rai.html">filed a lawsuit</a> [Star-Ledger report] claiming that warrantless immigration raids violate the US Constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> [official website] dropped the term &quot;enemy combatant&quot; from its legal lexicon Friday while limiting the range of persons eligible to be held at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay. Summarizing a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/documents/memo-re-det-auth.pdf">memo</a> [PDF text] submitted to the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the Department said in a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/March/09-ag-232.html">press release</a> that the new criterion for detention &quot;does not rely on the President&#8217;s authority as Commander-in-Chief independent of Congress&#8217;s specific authorization&quot; under the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ040.107">Authorization for the Use of Military Force</a> [text] passed by Congress in September 2001. The AUMF authorized the use of force against nations, organizations, or persons the president determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11 attacks, or harbored such organizations or persons. The Department also said the filing<BLOCKQUOTE>draws on the international laws of war to inform the statutory authority conferred by Congress. It provides that individuals who supported al Qaeda or the Taliban are detainable only if the support was substantial. And it does not employ the phrase &quot;enemy combatant.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>Rights advocates had <a href="/hotline/2009/02/obama-administration-must-define-enemy.php">lobbied aggressively</a> [JURIST comment] for the terminology change, which was effectuated as part of the Obama administration&#39;s general review of US detention policies, put in motion by a <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">series of executive orders</a> [JURIST report] issued in late January. The Justice Department said Friday that &quot;further refinements of the government&#8217;s position&quot; on detention might come as that review process continues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.af/">Supreme Court of Afghanistan</a> [court website] upheld a 20-year prison sentence for blasphemy against Afghani journalism student <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kambaksh">Sayad Parwaz Kambaksh</a> [JURIST news archive] in a secret February hearing, according to statements by his lawyer quoted in Thursday media reports. Kambaksh and his lawyer were <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090312.AFGHANSENTENCE12/TPStory/TPInternational/Asia/">unaware of the secret hearing</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report], and were not given any opportunity to argue against the sentence before the court. Kambaksh was <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/afghan-journalism-student-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] in January 2008 for distributing papers questioning gender roles under Islam. Kambaksh <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/afghan-student-sentenced-to-death-for_25.php">had no legal representation</a> [JURIST report] at trial and was allowed only three minutes to present his defense. The closed court invoked Article 130 of the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/af00000_.html">Afghanistan Constitution</a> [text] to pass down the death sentence, a penalty for blasphemy consistent with <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-hanafi.htm">Hanafi</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] Islamic law. <br /><br />Kambaksh <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/afghan-journalism-student-appeals-death.php">appealed his death sentence</a> [JURIST report] in May 2008 and appeared before a three-judge panel in October, saying the charges against him had been initiated by Balkh University professors and students with &#8220;private hostilities&#8221; against him. He told the court that his confessions were the result of torture by the Balkh province intelligence service. The court subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/afghan-journalism-student-death.php">reduced his sentence</a> [JURIST report] to 20 years in prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan opposition leader and ex-prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6959782.stm">Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>] on Sunday defied a house arrest order to lead a march by opposition activists and members of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/magazine/01PAKISTAN-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin">Pakistan lawyers&#39; movement</a> [NYT backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+lawyers+movement">news archive</a>] against <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=asif+ali+zardari">news archive</a>] and his <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> (PPP) [party website]. The government had ordered Sharif and many of his supporters to remain in their homes, but Sharif <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/nawaz-under-house-arrest-police-hs">said the order was illegal</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Dawn</font> report], and led an estimated crowd of 10,000 in the Lahore protest calling for full reinstatement of judges ousted by Zardari predecessor Pervez Musharraf in November 2007 after his declaration of emergency rule. During the march, protesters reportedly damaged state vehicles used to <a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\03\15\story_15-3-2009_pg13_6">block roadways</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</font> report] in the city, and police used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Several high-ranking police officials <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/punjab/dagp-dco-dig-operation-lahore-resign--zj">resigned from their posts</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Dawn</font> report] Sunday, protesting tactics used against lawyers&#39; movement members during recent demonstrations and detentions.<br /><br />Sunday&#39;s protest was part of a &quot;long march&quot; to Islamabad which <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-lawyers-face-government.php">began</a> [JURIST report] last Thursday and which is similar to last year&#39;s demonstrations against the Musharraf regime. Late last week, Zardari party spokesmen said that he <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-president-weighing-deal-on.php">might consider a compromise</a> [JURIST report] deal with the movement on reinstatement and a recent Supreme Court ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-supreme-court-bars-ex-pm.php">barred Sharif</a> [JURIST report] from holding elected office based on a past criminal conviction. Sharif and the PML-N have particularly urged the restoration of Chief Justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive]. Chaudhry, supported by many members of Pakistan&#39;s bar, <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/ousted-pakistan-chief-justice-claims.php">insists he is still chief justice</a> [JURIST report] under the Pakistani <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">constitution</a> [text].<br /><br />7:28 PM ET - Late reports from Pakistan Sunday suggested that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7945294.stm">Zardari was about to reinstate Chaudhry</a> [BBC report], as well as other as-yet-unrestored judges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former official of the <a href="http://www.legalinfo.gov.cn/english/englishindex.htm">China Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] criticized <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=torture">torture</a> [JURIST news archive] and violence in Chinese prisons Friday, calling for <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-03/13/content_7575427.htm">greater security measures</a> [<em>China Daily</em> report] in correctional facilities. The comments come following the February cover-up of the death of a prisoner, whose death was officially attributed to a game of &quot;hide and seek,&quot; but which was later revealed to be the result of an <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/27/content_10913220.htm">attack by a fellow prisoner</a> [Xinhua report]. Officials of the <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/organs/procuratorate.html">Supreme People&#39;s Protectorate</a> (SPP) [<em>People&#39;s Daily</em> backgrounder] told the <em>China Daily</em> that the SPP would increase its focus on the prevention of violence in the country&#39;s prisons, including violence and torture perpetrated by prison prosecutors and guards.<br /><br />Friday&#39;s comments come amid heightened criticism of China&#39;s human rights record following the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. In September 2008, <a href="http://www.hrichina.org/public/">Human Rights in China</a> (HRIC) [advocacy website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/rights-group-china-police-use-torture.php">report</a> [JURIST report] indicating that Chinese police and other officials still employ torture to elicit confessions and intimidate political dissidents despite domestic and international bans. A July 2008 <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/089/2008/en/8249b304-5724-11dd-90eb-ff4596860802/asa170892008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/china-human-rights-abuses-continuing-in.php">report</a>] released by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said the country had failed to make real improvements in the area. The report, which updated an April 2008 AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA17/050/2008/en/b5e6bfd8-0176-11dd-8daf-5b71323cd12c/asa170502008eng.pdf">report</a> [PDF text] detailing ongoing human rights abuses in the country, evaluated the Chinese government on its use of the death penalty, administrative detentions, the detention and abuse of rights activists, including journalists and lawyers, and Internet censorship.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/39039prs20090317.html">hailed</a> [press release] a <a href="/pdf/photosrehearingorder.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] not to revisit an earlier decision requiring the <a href="http://www.dod.gov">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) to disclose photographs of alleged detainee abuse. The Bush administration filed a request for rehearing either by panel or <span style="font-style:italic;">en banc</span> in November in response to a Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/second-circuit-rules-government-must.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] that the DOD must release the photographs of Iraqi and Afghan detainees after redacting personally identifying information. Endorsing Tuesday&#39;s decision, ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh said that:<blockquote>This decision is a stinging rejection of the Bush administration&#39;s attempt to keep the public in the dark about the widespread abuse of prisoners held in U.S. custody abroad. These photographs demonstrate that prison abuse was not aberrational and not confined to Abu Ghraib. Release of the photographs would send a powerful message that the new administration intends to make a clean break from the unaccountability of the Bush years.</blockquote>The government had sought to stifle release of the photographs, requested under the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text], on the grounds that they would either invade the privacy of the detainees or insight retaliation against US forces abroad. The Second Circuit held that the redaction of private information ordered by a lower court would alleviate any privacy concerns, and that the failure to release information due to safety concerns requires that &quot;an agency must identify at least one [endangered] individual with reasonable specificity.&quot;<br /><br />Governmental secrecy and the scope of the FOIA have been frequent points of disagreement between the US government and rights groups in recent years. The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) acknowledged earlier this month that the <a href="https://www.cia.gov">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official websites] had <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">report</a>] 92 interrogation video tapes, despite an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF]. In January, the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/second-circuit-rules-dod-may-withhold.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the DOD was not obligated under FOIA to release information on Guantanamo detainee interrogation to the Associated Press, citing privacy concerns and a lack of public interest in the information. In June, the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/pdf/wilner.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-court-rules-foia-does-not-apply.php">report</a>] that the FOIA does not require the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=nsa">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [JURIST news archive] to tell lawyers for Guantanamo Bay detainees whether it has used electronic surveillance methods to monitor their communications. Earlier this year, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] signed an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ExecutiveOrderPresidentialRecords/">executive order</a> [text] granting broader access to public documents and &quot;reaffirming the commitment to accountability and transparency.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Greek government announced Monday that it will seek to overhaul its police force in the wake of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7798056.stm">December riots</a> [BBC backgrounder] and last week&#39;s <a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100004_14/03/2009_105515">vandalism</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Kathimerini</span> report]. The Greek <a href="http://www.ypes.gr/">Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in Greek] has enlisted the help of British police in order to <a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100002_17/03/2009_105579">streamline the Greek police force</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Kathimerini</span> report] and make it more effective. Both Scotland Yard and the City of London police force have promised aid, and former head of the London City police <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/07/06/july7_ian_blair_interview_feature.shtml">Ian Blair</a> [BBC profile] and Scotland Yard official Christos Kalamatianos will <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/16/Scotland_Yard_helping_Greece_fight_terror/UPI-20271237225818/">lead the reorganization</a> [UPI report]. The plan is to follow the model of British police forces by creating 30 rapid response teams of 12 officers each, with each team equipped with the latest technology and transportation.<br /><br />The Greek police have been <a href="/forumy/2008/12/riots-in-greece-law-order-and-police.php">accused of being both ineffective and unnecessarily violent</a> [JURIST op-ed], following the accidental shooting of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos in December 2008. The police were then unable to contain the riots that followed in the Athenian neighborhood of Exarcheia for over a week. Attempts to control the protesters, students who were quickly were joined by local anarchist groups, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/mobile/i/bbc_news/top_stories/777/77708/story7770887.shtml?PDA=1">ended in isolating Exarcheia entirely</a> [BBC report] until the demonstrations subsided. Police found it equally difficult to subdue a spree of vandalism on Friday in Kolonaki, another Athenian neighborhood, and Greek island Thessaloniki which ended with more than forty stores looted and several banks attacked. The youths responsible for the attacks <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h01l01EXTsYzqGzkxjbRvtPBBmQAD96T4QLO0">dropped pamphlets</a> [AP report] that pledged their allegiance to anarchist groups.

The Bush administration offered the rationale that although the US also opposes sexual orientation discrimination, the federal government could not sign a statement which may have bound the US on matters pertaining to state jurisdiction. Among those states declining to support the statement were China, Russia, members of the Islamic Conference, and the Roman Catholic Church. The US Congress has yet to be notified of Obama&#39;s decision. Officials who spoke under conditions of anonymity said the Obama administration intends to continue to be vocal in its stance toward defending human rights. <br /><br />Gay rights have been a contentious issue worldwide with little global consensus. In November, the parliament of <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/burundi-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Burundi criminalized homosexuality</a>, and the Supreme Court of <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/nepal-supreme-court-approves-same-sex.php">Nepal approved same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST reports]. In October, the Portuguese parliament voted overwhelmingly <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/portugal-parliament-votes-down.php">against proposals to legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. In the US, same-sex marriages are now permitted in Massachusetts and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/connecticut-judge-signs-off-on-same-sex.php">Connecticut</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this week the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/vermont-legislature-considers-same-sex.php">Vermont legislature began debating a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize same-sex marriage. In November, same-sex marriage bans <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in California, Arizona, and Florida.<br /><br />2:12 PM ET: The US State Department has issued an official <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/03/120509.htm">statement</a> [text] that the US is &quot;is pleased to join the other 66 UN member states who have declared their support of this Statement that condemns human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity wherever they occur.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Russian court Tuesday refused a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/khodorkovsky-seeks-dismissal-of-new.php">request by defense lawyers</a> to drop <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-russia-oil-magnate-to-face.php">new embezzlement and money laundering charges</a> [JURIST reports] against former Russian oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">news archive</a>] and his former business partner <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-platon-lebedev">Platon Lebedev</a> [defense website]. The court also rejected a request by defense lawyers to have the case <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=13687260&PageNum=0">returned to state prosecutors</a> [ITAR-TASS report] for further investigation. The lawyers for Khodorkovsky and Lebedev <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090317/120610347.html">expressed incredulity</a> [RIA Novosti report] at the court&#39;s decisions, and warned prosecutors and the court that the case would not result in easy convictions of the two. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are accused of illegally taking approximately $20 billion from Russian energy firm <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901040719-662739,00.html">OAO Yukos Oil Co.</a> [TIME backgrounder], but challenged the allegations, asserting that the <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090306/120458573.html">evidence against them was insufficient</a> [RIA Novosti report] to sustain the prosecution. If found guilty, Khodorkovsky could face 22 years in jail in addition to the eight years he is already serving for fraud and tax evasion.<br /><br />Their trial on the charges <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-khodorkovsky-trial-begins-in-moscow.php">began earlier this month</a> [JURIST report]. Their request to have the charges dropped comes one day after Judge Viktor Danilkin <a href="http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=28421">refused to recuse himself</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times</font> report] from the case amid accusations of bias. Critics have claimed that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are politically motivated due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition of former Russian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST news archive]. The transfer of the two from prison to Moscow to stand trial on the new charges was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/khodorkovsky-to-face-new-trial-as.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] last month by a judge for the District Court in Moscow. Khodorkovsky still maintains that his <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/russian-oil-magnate-guilty-on-six.php">2005 conviction</a> [JURIST report] on the fraud and tax evasion was unjust, and maintains his innocence. He <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-yukos-oil-executive-applies-for.php">requested early release</a> from that sentence last July, but his application was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russian-court-denies-early-release-for.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] in August because he disobeyed guards at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/25/russia.tomparfitt">Krasnokamensk penal colony</a> [Guardian backgrounder], refused to participate in a training program, and faced the possibility of additional charges. Khodorkovsky has <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khodorkovsky-appeals-parole-rejection.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] that decision.

Obama attributed his decision to Hamilton&#39;s reputation as a mainstream jurist:<blockquote>Judge Hamilton has a long and impressive record of service and a history of handing down fair and judicious decisions. He will be a thoughtful and distinguished addition to the Seventh Circuit and I am extremely pleased to put him forward to serve the people of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.</blockquote>The first of Obama&#39;s federal judicial nominations has been broadly viewed as the first step in likely expansive <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/civil_rights/">civil rights reforms</a> [WH materials]. In addition to the 15 circuit court vacancies, there are 52 vacancies in federal district courts for a total of 67.

The court approved the presidency of 34-year-old Rajoelina despite a requirement in Madagascar&#39;s <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/cafrad/unpan005132.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF] that the president be at least 40 years of age, declaring that his presidency would be <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2009-03/18/content_7592739.htm">legal for a maximum two-year term</a> [<em>China Daily</em> report]. Ravalomanana passed control of the government to the military Tuesday after months of violence in hopes it would run the nation under a military directorate. The military subsequently passed power to Rajoelina, a former mayor of Madagascar&#39;s capital city of Antananarivo who had led protests against Ravalomanana&#39;s government. Members of the <a href="http://www.africa-union.org/">African Union</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=African+Union">news archive</a>] have since decried Rajoelina&#39;s appointment as unconstitutional, indicating that the move may amount to a coup.  <br /><br />Madagascar has faced increasing political violence over the last two months leading to dozens of deaths. In February the police opened fire on anti-Ravalomanana demonstrators, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7877918.stm">killing 28</a> [BBC report]. Rajoelina was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7867512.stm">fired as mayor of Antananarivo</a> [BBC report] in late January following his declaration that he was in charge of Madagascar and his failed efforts to impeach Ravalomanana. Much of the public unrest stemmed from criticisms that Ravalomanana failed to alleviate poverty, as well as his unpopular <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7851275.stm">decision to shut down a television station</a> [BBC report] owned by Rajoelina after the station aired an interview with one of Ravalomanana&#39;s former adversaries.

Lawyers&#39; movement supporters <a href="http://www.geo.tv/3-16-2009/37513.htm">rallied at Chaudhry&#39;s home</a> [Geo TV report] Monday, where the Chief Justice thanked the crowds for their support in the fight for reinstatement. Ali Ahmad Kurd, the president of the Pakistan Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/world/asia/17pstan.html?ref=world">commented favorably</a> [NYT report] on the  restoration, calling it a success for the country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] on Tuesday called on US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=eric+holder">news archive</a>] to <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertoholder_independentprosecutor.pdf">commission a special prosecutor</a>&nbsp;[letter, PDF; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/39060prs20090318.html">press release</a>] to investigate tactics used by CIA interrogators against terrorism suspects. ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a letter to Holder that <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22530">recently published characterizations</a> [NYRB op-ed; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/red-cross-deemed-cia-interrogation.php">report</a>] of CIA methods as torture by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a>&nbsp;(ICRC) [official website], combined with other evidence, obligated the attorney general to investigate the allegations. Romero said that those suspected in engaging in or facilitating torture should then be prosecuted under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002441----000-.html">War Crimes Act</a> [18 USC &sect; 2441 text] and the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_113C.html">Anti-Torture Act</a> [18 USC &sect; 2340 text], and that the statute of limitations for some of the alleged offenses would expire in less than a year: <blockquote>There Is Broad Authority to Investigate and Prosecute Torture Crimes, Including Any Crimes in Ordering or Authorizing Torture:  Based on prior government investigations, documents obtained by the ACLU through our FOIA litigation, and numerous media reports, there is credible evidence that acts authorized, ordered, and committed by government officials constitute violations of federal criminal statutes.  Although the political debate about whether acts such as waterboarding are torture has caused confusion in some press accounts, waterboarding and other forms of torture and abuse clearly violate existing federal criminal laws, including the War Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2441, the Anti-Torture Act, 18 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2340-2340A, and federal statutes that criminalize conduct such as assaults by or against U.S. nationals in overseas facilities used by the federal government.  There also are numerous federal criminal laws against obstructing or interfering with government investigations or court proceedings. [emphasis omitted]</blockquote>Romero went on to say that <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/dsm-leahy-schedules-truth-hearing-on.php">current efforts</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the interrogations were too weak to hold offenders accountable, and that only a special prosecutor sanctioned by the attorney general could effectively investigate the allegations.<br /><br />Earlier this month, the CIA admitted to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">destroying 92 tapes</a> of interrogations of the &quot;high-value&quot; detainees, later admitting that <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/destroyed-cia-interrogation-tapes.php">12 of the destroyed tapes</a> [JURIST reports] included evidence of &quot;Enhanced Interrogation Techniques&quot; (EIT). Rights groups and experts on torture have <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=us+torture">long criticized</a> [JURIST news archive] the US for its use of EIT, and US President Barack Obama in January issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-issues-torture-ban-orders-cia.php">report</a>] explicitly banning the use of waterboarding and other techniques that do no comport with Geneva Convention safeguards for prisoners of war.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A US magistrate judge in South Carolina ruled Wednesday that suspected al Qaeda operative <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/ali_saleh_kahlah_al_marri/index.html">Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al-marri">news archive</a>] must remain in prison as the criminal case against him proceeds. Judge Robert Carr denied al-Marri&#39;s request to be freed on bail, finding that he had <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aJBC1dASzvWY&refer=home">failed to prove that he was not a danger to the community</a> [Bloomberg report], despite his lawyer&#39;s assurance that he could be placed in a secure location until his trial. Al-Marri is scheduled to be arraigned in federal court in Illinois on Monday. It is unclear when he will be transferred from South Carolina.<br /><br />Last week, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/030609zr.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-dismisses-al-marri-enemy.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/motion-to-dismiss-al-marri.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] by the US government to dismiss as moot an appeal challenging al-Marri&#39;s indefinite detention, following the Obama administration&#39;s decision to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/enemy-combatant-al-marri-to-be-tried-in.php">try al-Marri in US federal court</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Marri was <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/terrorism/usalmarri22609ind.html">indicted</a> [indictment text; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-ag-177.html">press release</a>] earlier this month on two charges of providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring with others to provide material support to al Qaeda. In January, shortly after taking office, President Barack Obama ordered an <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-immediate-review-of.php">immediate review</a> [JURIST report] of al-Marri&#39;s detention. Al-Marri was arrested at his home in Peoria, Illinois by civilian authorities in 2001, and was indicted for other crimes. In 2003, then-President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/23/qatar.combatant/">declared him an enemy combatant</a> [CNN report] and ordered the attorney general to transfer custody of al-Marri to the defense secretary, claiming inherent authority to hold him indefinitely.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/">Vermont State Legislature</a> [official website] on Monday began a series of week-long hearings on a <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/bills/Intro/S-115.pdf">bill</a> [S.0115 text, PDF] that would allow <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. The bill, &quot;An Act to Protect Religious Freedom and Promote Equality in Civil Marriage,&quot; sponsored by Vermont State Senate President <span style="font-style:italic;">Pro Tempore</span> <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/protemp/default.htm">Peter Shumlin</a> and State Senators <a href="http://vermont-elections.org/2009-2010BioBook/s-winds.htm">John Campbell</a> and <a href="http://vermont-elections.org/2009-2010BioBook/s-add.htm">Claire Ayer</a> [official profiles], changes the definition of marriage to &quot;the legally recognized union of two people.&quot; Supporters and those opposed to the bill have come to the State House in Montpelier to <a href="http://www.necn.com/Boston/New-England/2009/03/16/Vermont-opens-hearings-on/1237247606.html">to voice their opinions</a> [NECN report]. The Vermont Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to conduct a <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/misc/posting2.htm">hearing on S.0115</a> [materials] on Wednesday.<br /><br />Vermont became the first state to offer civil unions to same-sex couples when then-Governor Howard Dean signed <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/DOCS/2000/BILLS/PASSED/H-847.HTM">H.B.847</a> [text] into law in April 2000. If S.0115 were to become law in Vermont, that state would be the fourth to legalize same-sex marriage. In October, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">report</a>] that the Connecticut Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry. In May, the California Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that California marriage statutes that limited marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the California constitution. However, in November, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passed</a> [JURIST report], amending the California constitution to define marriage as between a man and putting the status of same-sex marriages in California in doubt. In 2004, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts <a href="http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/440/440mass309.html">held in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">report</a>] that barring an individual from marriage based on the spouse&#39;s gender violated the Massachusetts Constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Computer chip maker <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/">Advanced Micro Devices</a> (AMD) [corporate website] revealed Monday in a <a href="http://idea.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000119312509054552/d8k.htm">filing</a> [text] with the US <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] that rival chip designer <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel Corp.</a> [corporate website] is threatening to cancel licenses granted to AMD in a joint venture between the two firms. Intel has alleged in correspondence with AMD that AMD is in <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20090316corp.htm?iid=pr1_releasepri_20090316r">breach</a> [Intel press release] of a 2001 cross-licensing patent agreement, and  if the breach is not corrected within 60 days, Intel will terminate AMD&#39;s licenses and rights under the agreement. AMD has responded to the allegations by denying the existence of any breach, and has alleged that the controversy has been <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/03/16/amd-intel-licenses-markets-equity-semiconductors.html">manufactured by Intel</a> [Forbes.com report] to draw attention from a number recent of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=intel+antitrust">antitrust lawsuits</a> [JURIST news archive]. The dispute between the two chip makers focuses on whether <a href="http://www.globalfoundries.com/about_us">Global Foundries</a> [corporate website], a chip foundry organized in a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/03/07/amd-abu-dhabi-technology-cio-network-amd.html">joint venture</a> [Forbes.com backgrounder] with the government of Abu Dhabi, is a subsidiary of AMD.<br /><br />Intel and AMD have been embroiled in legal controversies recently, particularly over Intel&#39;s business practices, which AMD has alleged are anti-competitive and amount to monopolization of the computer chip market. In July, the European Commission announced it was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/european-commission-brings-new.php">filing new charges</a> [JURIST report] against Intel for providing &quot;substantial&quot; rebates to one computer retailer on the condition that it only use Intel processors, and that it had both paid a computer manufacturer to delay selling AMD-based devices and offered the manufacturer similar exclusivity rebates. In June, the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">US Federal Trade Commission</a> [official website] launched an <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ftc-opens-intel-antitrust-probe.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Intel&#39;s business practices. Earlier that month, the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/intel-fined-25-million-for-antitrust.php">levied nearly $26 million in fines</a> [JURIST report] against Intel after a <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/south-korea-concludes-probe-into-intel.php">KFTC probe</a> [JURIST report] found that the company had engaged in anti-competitive practices. In January, the state of <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/new-york-opens-investigation-into.php">New York opened an antitrust probe</a> [JURIST report] into Intel&#39;s actions, and AMD has also <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/computer-chip-maker-amd-sues-intel-for.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/AMD-Intel_Full_Complaint.pdf">civil suit</a> [complaint, PDF; Intel <a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20050901corp.htm">response</a>] against the company.

The court affirmed the appearance of <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:fNvYlFhbPtIJ:milcom.jag.af.mil/ch03/uci.doc+unlawful+command+influence&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a">&quot;unlawful command influence&quot;</a> [JAG backgrounder] when a lawyer who had investigated the case sat in on meetings at which the case was discussed with the general who ultimately decided to charge Chessani. The court cited the government&#39;s failure to bring evidence to negate the appearance of unlawful command influence: <blockquote>[A]n objective, disinterested observer, fully informed of all the facts and circumstances, would harbor significant doubt about the fairness of this proceeding. Thus, we are left to conclude that the Government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt there was no apparent [unlawful command influence].</blockquote> Chessani, who was the commander of the battalion involved in the killings, was charged with violation of a lawful general order and dereliction of duty for failing to start a war crimes investigation.<br /><br />All but one of the eight Marines initially charged in connection to the Haditha incident have either had their charges dismissed or been found not guilty. In June, US Marine Corps <a href="http://www.innocentmarine.com/">1st Lt. Andrew Grayson</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=andrew+grayson">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/us-marine-cleared-of-all-charges-in.php">cleared on all counts</a>, including charges that he <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/haditha-killings-photo-evidence-ordered.php">ordered a subordinate officer to delete photographic evidence</a> [JURIST reports] of the killings. The court-martial of <a href="http://www.frankwuterich.com/">Staff Sgt.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN&nbsp;Special Rapporteur&nbsp;on human rights in&nbsp;<a href="/countries/northkorea.php">North Korea</a>&nbsp;[JURIST news archive]&nbsp;<a href="http://www0.un.org/News/Press/docs/2004/hr4786.doc.htm">Vitit Muntarbhorn</a> [UN appointment release] said Monday that he found there to be a <a href="http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/(httpNewsByYear_en)/B8D1FA23EB8613E4C125757B005DA2DB?OpenDocument">&quot;broad range of egregious human rights violations&quot;</a> [press release] in the country. In a report to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website], he&nbsp;criticized&nbsp;the country for using access to food as a method of controlling its population and for using torture in its prisons despite a formal ban. He also cited several areas in which the country needed to improve in both the short and long term, and called on the country to cooperate with the UN to improve the situation: <blockquote> Of special importance for the country, in the short term, is the need to ensure effective provision of and access to food and other basic necessities for those in need of assistance, and to enable people to undertake economic activities to satisfy their basic needs and supplement their livelihood without State interference; to end the punishment of those who seek asylum abroad and who are sent back to their country; to terminate public executions and abuses against the security of the person, and other violations of fundamental rights and freedoms; to cooperate effectively to resolve the issue of foreigners abducted by the country; and to respond constructively to the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur.<br /><br />In the longer term, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea should seek to modernize its national system by instituting reforms to ensure greater participation of the people in the process and compliance with international human rights standards; reallocate national budgets, including military budgets, to the social sector; take more extensive food security-related measures; and guarantee personal security and freedoms by dismantling the pervasive surveillance and intelligence system, reforming the justice and prison system, and abiding by the rule of law.</blockquote>Sang Il Hun, a North Korea&nbsp;representative&nbsp;to the Council, rejected Montarbhorn&#39;s conclusions, saying the country&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/11/north-korea-protests-proposed-un.php">did not recognize</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] the UN General Assembly <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/gashc3940.doc.htm">resolution</a> [text] that created his position. Sang said the report was a politically motivated attack on the country, and that North Korea adequately protects human rights.<br /><br />In December, the&nbsp;UN <a href="http://www.wfp.org/">World Food Programme</a> [official website] estimated that approximately 40 percent of North Korea&#39;s population, or&nbsp;8.7 million people, will <a href="http://www.wfp.org/content/87-million-north-koreans-need-food-assistance">need food assistance</a>&nbsp;[press release] this year due to a deficit in domestic cereal production. In October, Muntarbhorn urged North Korea to <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/un-investigator-urges-north-korea-to.php">improve their rights record</a> [JURIST report] because of their treatment of prisoners, unsuccessful defectors, and their failure to cooperate in locating kidnapped foreign citizens. In January 2008, Muntarbhorn made similar comments during his visit with a <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/ADE17C48D3104468C12573D400504F4B?opendocument">special UN envoy to Japan</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/north-korea-still-violating-human.php">report</a>] to assess the impact of the North Korean rights situation on that country.&nbsp;North Korea has frequently been accused of <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/us-human-trafficking-report-cites.php">human trafficking</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/us-slips-in-world-press-freedom-index.php">press repression</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/north-korea-committing-crimes-against.php">&quot;actively committing crimes against humanity&quot;</a> [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel of the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/index.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0102p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday a district court decision finding former El Salvador chief military commander <a href="http://www.cja.org/cases/carranza.shtml">Nicolas Carranza</a> [CJA backgrounder] liable for murder and torture committed during the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">El Salvador civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder] in the 1980s. In 2005, a Tennessee federal jury <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/us-jury-finds-ex-salvadoran-colonel.php">found Carranza liable</a> [JURIST report] for acts of murder and torture in El Salvador under the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1350.notes.html">Alien Tort Statute</a> (ATS) and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-notes.html">Torture Victims Protection Act</a> (TVPA) [texts]. Carranza had appealed the jury verdict, claiming that the district court abused its discretion by holding that extraordinary circumstances justified equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, not granting comity to a Salvadoran amnesty law, and making various evidentiary rulings. He also argued that the district court erred in its jury instruction concerning command responsibility. In the opinion, Judge Eugene Siler addressed the Sixth Circuit&#39;s reasons for upholding the district court&#39;s decision to allow equitable tolling of the statute of limitations for claims under the ATS and the TVPA:<blockquote>We have identified five factors a district court should consider when determining whether to equitably toll the statute of limitations: (1) lack of notice of the filing requirement, (2) lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement, (3) diligence in pursuing one&#8217;s rights, (4) absence of prejudice to the defendant, and (5) the plaintiff&#8217;s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the particular legal requirement. ... <br /><br />In sum, we conclude that the ten-year limitations period applicable to TVPA claims also governs claims under the ATS, equitable tolling principles apply, and the existence of extraordinary circumstances provides a justification for the application of the equitable tolling doctrine.</blockquote>In February, Carranza was <a href="http://www.cja.org/GarciaPRfeb2009.pdf">indicted</a> [CJA press release, PDF] by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for two counts of immigration fraud. During the <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/former-el-salvador-military-officer.php">2005 trial</a> [JURIST report], the jury heard testimony by five Salvadoran citizens who alleged they were tortured or had family members killed by soldiers who served under Carranza, the top commander of El Salvador&#39;s security forces during the civil war. A verdict was reached in favor of four of the five accusers with the jury awarding $500,000 in compensatory damages to each plaintiff. The lawsuit accused Carranza, who moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1985, of allowing crimes against humanity during the war. The Salvadoran plaintiffs brought their case in US court under the ATS, also called the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA), which allows foreign victims of serious human rights abuse abroad to sue perpetrators in federal court.

The sentences have been delayed because two of the members, President Jalal Talabani and Vice-President Tariq al-Hashemi, have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD97002307">opposed the sentences</a> [AP report] of Hashim al-Taie and Hussein Rashid Mohammed, alleging that both men&#39;s roles in the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1993/iraqanfal/">1988 Anfal campaign against ethnic Kurds</a> [HRW backgrounder] were coerced on threats of death by Saddam Hussein. In accordance with Iraqi law, all three members of the Iraqi Presidential Council must approve the measures. The death sentences and convictions of al-Taie, Mohammed, and Hassan al-Majid, known as <a href="http://iraqipresidency.net/index.php?language=arabic">&quot;Chemical Ali&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive], were <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/iraq-tribunal-upholds-death-sentences.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the Appeals Chamber of the Iraqi High Tribunal in September 2007 on charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in connection to the 1988 Anfal campaign.<br /><br />&quot;Chemical Ali&quot; has received two other death sentences in connection with the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iraq-court-gives-chemical-ali-third.php">killings of rioting protesters</a> [JURIST report] in Baghdad and Amarah following the alleged assassination of a prominent Shiite cleric, and for his involvement in the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/iraqi-tribunal-gives-chemical-ali.php">repression of Shiite protesters</a> [JURIST report] in southern Iraq following the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/08/08-10092.wpd.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the constitutionality of a Texas law mandating daily observance of a minute of silence in public schools. The three-judge panel affirmed the ruling of the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas that deemed constitutional the 2003 amendments to <a href="http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/docs/ED/content/htm/ed.002.00.000025.00.htm#25.082.00">&sect; 25.0821 of the Texas Educational Code</a> [text, PDF] which provide for the enforcement of a minute of silence during which prayer is an enumerated suggested activity. The appellants argued that the statute has a religious purpose, pointing to legislative history including a statement by a legislator about the lack of school prayer. The Fifth Circuit applied the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0602_ZS.html">Lemon v. Kurtzman</a> [opinion text] to find that as long as the statute serves a plausible secular purpose, it does not violate the Establishment clause and an individual legislator&#39;s religious motivation for supporting the statute does not alter its constitutionality:<blockquote>[O]ur review of legislative history is deferential, and such deference leads to an adequate secular purpose in this case. While we cannot allow a &quot;sham&quot; legislative purpose, we should generally defer to the stated legislative intent. Here, that intent was to promote patriotism and allow for a moment of quiet contemplation. These are valid secular purposes, and are not outweighed by limited legislative history showing that some legislators may have been motivated by religion.</blockquote>In reaching its decision, the Fifth Circuit analogized to other circuits that have held similar moment of silence statutes constitutional if their provisions legitimately served a dual secular and religious purpose. <br /><br />The use of prayer, moments of silence, or religious references in public schools has been highly contested. In January, an Illinois District court held that that an Illinois state law requiring a moment of silence in public schools is <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/federal-judge-rules-illinois-school.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In July, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/federal-court-rules-part-of-florida.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] part of a Florida law that requires students in grades kindergarten through 12 to obtain parental permission before they can be excused from reciting the <a href="/currentawareness/pledge.php">Pledge of Allegiance</a> [JURIST news archive]. In 2005, a federal judge in San Francisco <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/breaking-news-federal-judge-rules.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools with the language &quot;under God&quot; is unconstitutional.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The appellate chamber of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] on Tuesday partially reversed the conviction and <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krajisnik/acjug/en/090317_summary.pdf">reduced the sentence</a> [judgment summary, PDF; <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10079">press release</a>] of former Bosnian Serb parliamentary leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/krajisnik/4">Momcilo Krajisnik</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Krajisnik">news archive</a>] from 27 to 20 years. Krajisnik was initially <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/krajisnik/trialc/judgement/kra-jud060927e.pdf">convicted</a> [judgment, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/former-bosnian-serb-parliament-leader.php">report</a>] in 2006 on charges of persecution, extermination, murder, deportation, and forced transfer of non-Serb civilians during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. The appellate chamber affirmed the trial chamber&#39;s ruling that Krajisnik had the intent to engage in deportation, forced transfer, and persecution of non-Serbs. It went on to hold that the trial chamber did not have any evidence that he intended to engage in crimes of murder and extermination and overturned the convictions for expanded crimes of murder, extermination, and persecution with the exception of the underlying acts of deportation and forcible transfer.<br /> <br />At Krajisnik&#39;s 2006 trial, the ICTY found him not guilty on a charge of genocide for which prosecutors had <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/icty-prosecutors-seek-life-sentence.php">requested a life sentence</a> [JURIST report].  He was instead sentenced to 27 years imprisonment. Krajisnik was initially indicted together with <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/plavsic/4">Biljana Plavsic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=plavsic">news archive</a>], the former Bosnian Serb president, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2003 after testifying against Krajisnik. Former Bosnian Serb leader <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/karadzic/4">Radovan Karadzic</a> [ICTY materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Karadzic">news archive</a>], with whom Krajisnik worked closely, was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/war-crimes-suspect-radovan-karadzic.php">arrested last year</a> [JURIST report] and currently faces war crimes charges before the ICTY.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Top officials from the Obama administration met with leaders from the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/eu.php">news archive</a>] Monday to discuss plans to transfer detainees from <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] to European countries. US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] met with the delegation headed by European Justice and Security Commissioner <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/barrot/welcome/default_en.htm">Jacques Barrot</a> [official profile] and Czech Interior Minister <a href="http://www.langer.cz/">Ivan Langer</a> [official profile, in Czech] to encourage the EU&#39;s cooperation in closing the Guantanamo Bay facility by the end of the year. The US officials assured the EU that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/us/politics/17gitmo.html?ref=world">US will provide background information</a> [NYT report] pertaining to each prisoner to allow European countries to decide whether to accept them. EU members had previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/eu-says-us-must-provide-more.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over accepting detainees without first examining potential safety and security implications. The US is seeking European cooperation because of potential legal issues associated with keeping Guantanamo Bay detainees on US soil after the facility closes. The leaders remained in Washington Tuesday to continue discussions.<br /><br />Last month, the European Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-parliament-urges-eu-acceptance.php">encouraged EU member nations</a> to accept former Guantanamo prisoners soon after President Obama ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/guantanamo-prison-closure-order-hailed.php">closure of the detention center</a> [JURIST reports] in February. <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/spain-agrees-to-accept-guantanamo.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ireland-open-to-accepting-released.php">Ireland</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/portugal-foreign-minister-urges-eu.php">Portugal</a> [JURIST reports] have already expressed their willingness to host detainees. Other EU members, including <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/poland-minister-not-eager-to-accept.php">Poland</a> [JURIST report], <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ed6b5a2-0427-11de-845b-000077b07658,dwp_uuid=70662e7c-3027-11da-ba9f-00000e2511c8.html?nclick_check=1">Sweden, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic</a> [<em>Financial Times</em> report], have expressed strong reservations to doing so.

Lamberth <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gWUKFIetDfTJ6olJQ7P21bgYpyMgD96VE33G0">accused both political parties</a> [AP report] of causing harm to the federal judiciary by delaying the confirmation of federal appointees based on the clients they have previously represented. Lamberth was particularly critical of the recent delays in the confirmation of President Barack&nbsp;Obama&#39;s selections for positions at the Justice Department, <a href="http://www.wilmerhale.com/david_ogden/">David Ogden</a> [professional profile] and Thomas Perrelli. Ogden, the nominee for Deputy Attorney General,&nbsp;went before the&nbsp;<a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>&nbsp;[committee website] last month&nbsp;to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/deputy-ag-nominee-ogden-defends.php">defend his past representation</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] of parties opposing anti-pornography and pre-abortion parental notification laws. Lamberth said that such a partisan, divisive process has and will continue to discourage highly qualified individuals from seeking positions within the judiciary.<br /><br />Last week, the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/senate-confirms-ogden-as-deputy.php">confirmed Ogden</a> [JURIST report] as the new Deputy Attorney General by a vote of 65-28. Perrelli was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/bloomberg/20090312/pl_bloomberg/amp2xgwj29zc_1">also confirmed</a> [<em>Bloomberg</em> report] as Associate Attorney General in a 72-20 vote by the Senate last week. Ogden and Perrelli were among the four former Clinton-era attorneys that were <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-appoints-clinton-era-lawyers-to.php">nominated</a> [JURIST report] for high-level positions in the Obama administration in January. Both former president <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/bush-criticizes-senate-treatment-of.php">George W. Bush</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/senate-republicans-call-for-end-to.php">Senate Republican Committee</a>&nbsp;[JURIST reports] have also criticized the confirmation process, citing vacancies that would last for years as nominees waited to be voted on, or were forced to withdraw their names.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Chinese government on Friday detained a former soldier who has called for an investigation into the 1989 killings of pro-democracy protesters at <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/4/newsid_2496000/2496277.stm">Tiananmen Square</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Chinese human rights organization <a href="http://www.msguancha.com/index.html">Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch</a> (CRLW) [official website, in Chinese] said that Zhang Shijun, a former member of the Chinese army&#39;s 162nd motorized infantry division, has been <a href="http://www.msguancha.com/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=1860">detained</a> (CRLW report, in Chinese] after he wrote an open letter to Chinese Premier Hu Jintao calling for an investigation into the killings. Zhang was recently <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jGNpce9fQ3nnY8HKivcik_zOHeowD970HE980">interviewed</a> about the events of that day, lamenting his own role, and was then <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jGNpce9fQ3nnY8HKivcik_zOHeowD971O4600">detained</a> [AP reports] by local authorities. <br /><br />A report by <a href="http://64.233.169.132/translate_c?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=http://crd-net.org/Article/Class9/Class10/200903/20090310095653_14188.html&prev=hp&usg=ALkJrhj5ip3FrB2pKmdh4IlRb7MO_Elcfw">Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> (CHRD) [advocacy website] suggests that Chinese authorities have intensified arrests of dissidents because of the approaching 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests. The Tiananmen protests began in April 1989 with mainly students and laborers protesting the Communist Party of China. The Chinese government declared martial law in May, and initiated the violent dispersal of protesters by the People&#39;s Liberation Army on June 4. The government has never publicized official figures, but the Hong Kong-based <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/">Information Center for Human Rights &amp; Democracy</a> [advocacy website] reported last June that unnamed sources had <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/main/messages/16647.html">estimated 600 people were killed</a> [ICHR report, in Chinese]. Rights groups have continued to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/hrw-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen.php">urge the Chinese government to release</a> [JURIST report] the remaining imprisoned protesters.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/3.18.09%20Al%20Shimari%20decision.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] in an order made public Thursday that defense contractor <a href="http://www.caci.com/">CACI International</a> [corporate website] is not immune from a lawsuit brought by <a href="/currentawareness/abughraib.php">Abu Ghraib</a> [JURIST news archive] torture victims, denying CACI&#39;s motion to dismiss. Judge Gerald Bruce Lee held that the four plaintiffs could go forward with their suit based on allegedly torturous interrogative techniques conducted by CACI. The defense contractor claimed &quot;derivative absolute official immunity&quot; on the grounds that they were performing &quot;a discretionary function within the scope of their government contract&quot; and that the &quot;public benefit of immunity for contractor interrogators outweighs the cost of ignoring a potential injustice should Plaintiffs&#39; claims go unremedied and unaddressed.&quot; Lee rejected the argument that CACI was acting within their discretionary scope due to a lack of such evidence at the current stage of litigation. Lee also rejected the public benefit argument, holding that while &quot;in some circumstances, government contractors are immune from liability while performing their government contracts,&quot; a balancing test must be applied to weigh the public benefits associated with such immunity with the need to hold individuals &quot;accountable for their wrongful acts.&quot; The court addressed the public interest in immunity by finding that:<blockquote>[t]he public outcry against the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib was strong and compelling. Photographs of detainee abuse scarred the national conscience, leading to the publication of numerous books, newspaper and magazine articles and at least one congressional investigation. On the limited record currently before the Court, the Court cannot say that the public has a stronger interest in recognizing immunity than it does in allowing Plaintiffs&#39; suit to proceed.</blockquote>CACI <a href="http://www.caci.com/iraq/statement.shtml">responded to the judgment</a> [press release], stating its intent to &quot;vigorously pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the company&#39;s good name.&quot;<br /><br />Abu Ghraib was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/iraq-reopens-abu-ghraib-prison-with.php">reopened in February</a> [JURIST report] by the Iraqi government with promises to uphold international human rights standards. The four detainees <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ex-abu-ghraib-detainees-sue-military.php">filed their suit</a> [JURIST report] last year against CACI and L-3 Services but later <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/virginia/vaedce/1:2008cv00827/232957/18/">dismissed the claim against L-3</a> [notice of dismissal]. CACI <a href="http://www.caci.com/iraq/truth_error.shtml">defends themselves</a> [text] on their website, denying their involvement in Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan, the extent of their authority at Abu Ghraib, and other allegations. CACI <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/fourth-circuit-dismisses-abu-ghraib.php">sued Air America for defamation</a> [JURIST report] last year, losing on First Amendment grounds. The court found this prior suit to be contradictory to the company&#39;s claim that the current litigation is clouded by the &quot;fog of war.&quot;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] said Thursday that it would conduct an internal investigation into reports that Israeli soldiers have committed war crimes against Palestinian civilians. The <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1072350.html">announcement</a> follows soldiers&#39; <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1072040.html">reports of civilian killings</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Haaretz</font> reports] and vandalism under liberal rules of engagement during a recent operation in the Gaza Strip. It also came on the same day that UN Special Rapportuer on human rights in the Palestinian territories <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/1ce874ab1832a53e852570bb006dfaf6/0da4ba56ade85249852574190058d462!OpenDocument">Richard Falk</a> [appointment release] issued a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.20.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website], in which Falk <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1072481.html">criticized Israel</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Haaretz</font> report] for failing to take adequate precautions to distinguish between civilians and combatants in their offensives in the region. Falk called for an independent investigation into the alleged crimes, which he said included the targeting of hospitals and mosques, the use of white phosphorus incendiary bombs in heavily populated areas, as well as Israel&#39;s blockade of the Gaza Strip. The <a href="http://www.pchrgaza.org/">Palestinian Centre for Human Rights</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.pchrgaza.org/files/PressR/English/2008/36-2009.html">estimated</a> [press release] that 1,417 have died in the conflict, of which 926 were civilians.<br /><br />Earlier this week, a group of 16 human rights investigators and judges sent an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amnesty.org.nz/archived_news/experts_seek_gaza_inquiry+">open letter</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/human-rights-leaders-call-for.php">report</a>] to UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ban+ki-moon">news archive</a>] and the UN Security Council calling for an investigation into the alleged crimes. Earlier this month, Iran announced that it would seek <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iran-to-seek-interpol-arrest-warrants.php">INTERPOL arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Israeli war crimes suspects. In January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D78B7DAC697D3060C1257539003B5F3A?opendocument">called for an independent investigation</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-head-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] of possible war crimes and human rights violations in Gaza. <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is also <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/palestinian-leaders-urge-icc.php">attempting to gain jurisdiction over Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its actions in Gaza for alleged war crimes. Israel has already <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/israel-pm-asks-justice-minister-to.php">begun to consider defenses against possible war crimes charges</a>, partly based on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">accusations</a> [JURIST reports] that it used white phosphorus in a civilian area.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Israeli president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6054502.stm">Moshe Katsav</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Katsav">news archive</a>] was indicted Thursday on two counts of rape for allegedly assaulting several female employees in the 1990s. The indictment, which was filed in Tel Aviv District Court, <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1237461625065&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull">charges</a> [<em>Jerusalem Post</em> report] Katsav with two counts of rape, multiple counts of sexual harassment and forced indecent acts, and witness intimidation. The alleged rapes were committed while Katsav was the minister of tourism, while the other alleged acts were committed while Katsav served as president. A Katsav adviser <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1072415.html">decried the charges</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report], saying that the evidence against Katsav does not support the charges, and that the indictment was brought against the recommendation of a number of leading Israeli jurists. <br /><br />The Katsav indictment was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-ex-president-to-be-indicted-on.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] two weeks ago by Attorney General Menachem Mazuz. Katsav was <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/israel-president-may-face-rape-sex.php">originally accused of rape</a> [JURIST report] and sexual assault in 2006. In April, Katsav <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/israel-ex-president-rejects-plea.php">rejected</a> a controversial <A src="/paperchase/2007/06/israel-president-to-resign-under-plea.php">plea agreement</A> [JURIST reports], under which he would have been permitted to plead guilty to lesser sex charges of indecent assault, sexual harassment, and obstruction of justice, in exchange for a suspended sentence and the dropping of the rape charges. The deal was <A src="/paperchase/2007/07/israel-high-court-puts-katsav-plea.php">heavily criticized</A> [JURIST report] by women&#39;s and civil rights activists when it was first made public in 2007. A victim and several rights organizations filed <A HREF="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/877071.html">five separate petitions</A> [<em>Haaretz</em> report] to overturn the agreement, arguing that it was contrary to public interest, had no legal reason, and injured the principal of equality before the law. Despite the criticism, Mazuz defended the agreement as necessary to protect the office of the presidency from further injury and spare the country from embarrassment. Katsav resigned the presidency in 2007.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST]  Israeli forces arrested 12 Hamas leaders during raids in the West Bank Thursday. Among those <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090319/wl_afp/mideastconflictwestbank_20090319125412">seized</a> [AFP report; <em>Haaretz</em> <a href="http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1072289.html">report</a>, in Hebrew] were former Palestine deputy prime minister Nasseredin al-Shaer and Hamas officials Adnan Asfur and Raafat Nassif. The seizures came after Israel and Hamas <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/18/20090317/twl-israel-hamas-prisoner-swap-talks-sin-3cd7efd.html">failed to reach an agreement</a> [AFP report] on a prisoner exchange on Tuesday. Israel did not obtain the release of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=shalit">Gilad Shalit</a> [JURIST news archive], an Israeli soldier who was captured by Hamas in 2006, despite offering to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1071978.html">blames the failure of the negotiations on Israel</a> [<em>Haaretz</em> report], claiming that the Palestinian prisoners Israel was willing to release would have faced deportation from the West Bank.  <br /><br />Soon after Shalit&#39;s capture, Israel <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/israel-arrests-hamas-leaders-warns-of.php">seized Hamas leaders</a> [JURIST report] including Palestinian Cabinet ministers and lawmakers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The government of Pakistan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">President Ali Asif Zardari</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=asif+ali+zardari">news archive</a>] and his <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> (PPP) [party website] filed an appeal with the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/default.asp">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] Thursday, asking the court to review its February <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-supreme-court-bars-ex-pm.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] banning former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6959782.stm">Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>] and his brother from holding elected office. The Supreme Court based its decision on a criminal conviction against Sharif, the leader of the <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website], for attempting to divert a plane carrying army commander and later president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pervez+musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a> [JURIST news archive] in 1999 during a coup attempt. A government spokesperson said that the <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/government-appeals-ruling-against-sharifs-disqualification-ha">appeal</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] was made in the interest of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7952897.stm">constitutionalism and the rule of law</a> [BBC report]. The filing of the report was seen by many, including the PML-N, as a condition for ending the recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=long+march">protests and &quot;long march&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] against the Zardari government, which culminated in Monday&#39;s <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-ousted-chief-justice-to-be.php">reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] of Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive].<br /><br />Chaudhry&#39;s reinstatement was seen as a positive step for democratic rule in Pakistan. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7310028.stm">Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani</a> [BBC profile] announced early Monday that the government would reinstate Chaudhry in response to recent protests by members of the lawyers&#39; movement and opposition politicians and supporters. Gilani also <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/gilani-announces-restoration-of-deposed-chief+judge-hs">ordered government officials to release</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] anyone <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-police-arrest-lawyers.php">arrested</a> during the past week&#39;s so-called <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-lawyers-face-government.php">&quot;long march&quot;</a> [JURIST reports]. Reports first surfaced late Sunday that President Zardari had agreed to reinstate Chaudhry and other judges ousted by Zardari&#39;s predecessor Musharraf in November 2007 after his declaration of emergency rule. Sharif and the PML-N have <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-ex-pm-leads-march-for-judges.php">actively campaigned</a> [JURIST report] for Chaudhry&#39;s reinstatement, leading a similar &quot;long march&quot; last summer. Chaudhry has always maintained that <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/ousted-pakistan-chief-justice-claims.php">he is still chief justice</a> [JURIST report] under the Pakistani <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">constitution</a> [text].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesperson for the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] said Wednesday that the DOJ will limit prison restrictions on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1779455.stm">John Walker Lindh</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Lindh">news archive</a>], a California man known as the &quot;American Taliban.&quot; Lindh is serving a 20-year sentence in an Indiana federal prison after <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/pleaagreement.htm">pleading guilty</a> [plea agreement] in 2002 to supplying services to the Taliban. DOJ spokesman Dean Boyd said certain <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jL2eJWLXJtHYpsldtqfWc34pJr_gD970ICT01">restrictions on Lindh will be lifted</a> [AP report] Friday. Boyd did not discuss the details of the restrictions, but Lindh&#39;s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-taliban19-2009mar19,0,1100268.story">lawyer said</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span> report] Lindh will be allowed to visit with more people.<br /><br />After pleading guilty to a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/2ndindictment.htm">charge</a> [indictment] of aiding the Taliban, Lindh repeatedly asked then-president George W. Bush to reduce his 20-year sentence. Bush <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/federal-judge-rules-lindh-commutation.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to do so. The <a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a> [media website] then sued the DOJ to gain access under the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] to Lindh&#39;s petition for commutation. In December, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/2nd-cir-no-07-1384-cv-opn.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/federal-judge-rules-lindh-commutation.php">report</a>] the lower court&#39;s ruling that Lindh&#39;s petition fell under a FOIA invasion-of-privacy exception and as such was not available to the public.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] passed a <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1586eh.txt.pdf">bill</a> [H.R. 1586 text, PDF] Thursday that would tax bonuses given to employees of companies that received money from government stimulus programs at 90 percent. The bill, which was passed by a vote of <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll143.xml">328-93</a> [roll call vote], was drafted and voted on in reaction to large bonus payments made in the past week to employees of embattled insurance company <a href="http://www.aig.com/about-aig_20_19308.html">American International Group</a> (AIG) [corporate website]. A number of Republican representatives supported the bill, which also received many Democratic votes. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a 90 percent tax on bonuses from a company that received more than $5 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_bills&docid=f:h1424enr.txt.pdf">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008</a> [text, PDF], <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/index.jhtml">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> [corporate websites], or any entity related to those companies. The tax will not apply to employees who irrevocably waive their entitlement to  bonuses defined in the legislation. The bill will now move to a vote in the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/">Senate</a> [official website]. While the bill was an immediate response to recent employee bonuses at AIG, if signed into law, it would <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/19/AR2009031901542.html">affect employees</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report] at many of the world&#39;s leading financial institutions, where compensation is often heavily reliant on bonuses. <br /><br />The House passage of H.R. 1586 comes more than a month after <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] announced a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-restricts-executive-compensation.php">$500,000 cap on executive compensation</a> [JURIST report] for companies receiving &quot;exceptional assistance&quot; from the federal government. That statement came in conjunction with an announcement from <a href="http://treasury.gov/organization/bios/geithner-e.shtml">Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner</a> [official profile], highlighting <a href="http://treasury.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm">increased restrictions on financial institutions</a> [Treasury press release] receiving government assistance. The strong reaction to exorbitant executive compensation and bonuses comes as the US government and the Obama administration attempt to grapple with the ongoing global <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=financial+crisis">financial crisis</a> [JURIST news archive]. Attempts to gain control over the roiling credit markets and possible widespread bank insolvencies have included the passage in September of a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/700-billion-us-financial-rescue-bill.php">$700 billion financial rescue bill</a> [JURIST report], creating the TARP, which provided economic assistance to at-risk financial institutions. In early October, the US Securities and Exchange Commission began an <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/sec-begins-accounting-rules-review-as.php">agency review of financial accounting procedures</a> [JURIST report], including <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-234.htm">&quot;mark-to-market&quot;</a> [SEC backgrounder] rules.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp20959.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20959.htm">press release</a>] accountant David Friehling with fraud for his alleged role in the securities fraud scheme committed by financier <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive]. In the complaint, the SEC alleges that Friehling and his accounting firm made fraudulent representations that they had audited Madoff&#39;s records in accordance with <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/download/members/div/auditstd/au-00150.pdf">Generally Accepted Auditing Standards</a> [text, PDF], even though they had not, that these misrepresentations had enabled Madoff&#39;s scheme, and that the firm profited from the fraud. Because of these allegations, Friehling faces charges under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2A_20_I.html">Securities Act</a> [15 USC &sect; 77 text], the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/ch2B.html">Exchange Act</a> [15 USC &sect; 78 text], and the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/usc_sup_01_15_10_2D_20_II.html">Advisers Act</a> [15 USC &sect; 80 text]. If found guilty, he faces up to 105 years in prison and would have to return any profit he made from the fraud.<br /><br />Last week, Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf">charges of securities fraud</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">report</a>]. Last month, Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/madoff-reaches-agreement-with-sec-on.php">consented</a> [JURIST report] to a <a href="http://sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20889.htm">partial judgment</a> [SEC press release] with the SEC over civil charges brought by the SEC to obtain a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against him. The same day, SEC Division of Enforcement Director Linda Thomsen announced she was <a href="http://sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-22.htm">stepping down from her post</a> [SEC press release]. In the week following Madoff&#39;s charges, SEC Chairman <a href="http://www.sec.gov/about/commissioner/cox.htm">Christopher Cox</a> [official profile] said that he would <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-297.htm">launch an immediate investigation</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-launching-investigation-of-failure.php">report</a>] into how the fraud allegedly perpetrated by Madoff went undetected for so long. In December, then-President-elect <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">Barack Obama</a> [official profile] <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president-elect_obama_names_key_regulatory_appointments/">named</a> [press release] <a href="http://www.finra.org/AboutFINRA/Leadership/p009733">Mary Schapiro</a> [professional profile] as the SEC Chairman, replacing Cox.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] New Mexico <a href="http://www.governor.state.nm.us/index2.php">Governor Bill Richardson</a> (D) [official website] on Wednesday signed a <a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/09%20Regular/bills/house/HB0285.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF; HB 285 <a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/_session.aspx?Chamber=H&LegType=B&LegNo=285&year=09">materials</a>] which <a href="http://www.governor.state.nm.us/press.php?id=1103">repealed</a> [press release] the use of the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/currentawareness/death.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. The bill replaces the use of capital punishment with a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for capital felony convictions. Richardson spoke about his reasons for signing the bill, admitting that he changed his view of capital punishment during his time as governor and encouraging other states to abolish the death penalty:<br /><blockquote>Throughout my adult life, I have been a firm believer in the death penalty as a just punishment &#8211; in very rare instances, and only for the most heinous crimes. I still believe that. But six years ago, when I took office as Governor of the State of New Mexico, I started to challenge my own thinking on the death penalty. Regardless of my personal opinion about the death penalty, I do not have confidence in the criminal justice system as it currently operates to be the final arbiter when it comes to who lives and who dies for their crime. If the State is going to undertake this awesome responsibility, the system to impose this ultimate penalty must be perfect and can never be wrong. But... [t]he system is inherently defective. DNA testing has proven that. Innocent people have been put on death row all across the country.<br /><br />From an international human rights perspective, there is no reason the United States should be behind the rest of the world on this issue. Many of the countries that continue to support and use the death penalty are also the most repressive nations in the world. That&#8217;s not something to be proud of. In a society which values individual life and liberty above all else, where justice and not vengeance is the singular guiding principle of our system of criminal law, the potential for wrongful conviction and, God forbid, execution of an innocent person stands as anathema to our very sensibilities as human beings. That is why I&#8217;m signing this bill into law.</blockquote>The bill, which was <a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/22487/guv-abolishes-death-penalty-in-nm">approved</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">New Mexico Independent</font>&nbsp;report] by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/_session.aspx?Chamber=H&LegType=B&LegNo=285&year=09">New Mexico Senate</a> [official website] by a vote of 24-18 last week, goes into effect on July 1. It is not clear what will happen to those currently on death row in New Mexico.<br /><br />With the legislation, New Mexico will become the second state to abolish the death penalty since the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] reinstated it nationally in 1976. New Jersey was the first state to <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">pass</a> [JURIST report] such a law in 2007. There are currently <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jK5KO2fnkM_9t1eyS0TE3p9NMt3QD97113JO1">fourteen other states</a> [AP report] which do not allow the death penalty. According to the <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/">Death Penalty Information Center</a> (DPIC) [advocacy website], Maryland, Utah, Kansas, Colorado, and Montana are <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/recent-legislative-activity-death-penalty">considering</a> [press release] eliminating or limiting the use of capital punishment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iranian blogger Omidreza Mirsayafi reportedly committed suicide Wednesday after serving one month of a 30-month prison sentence for insulting Iran&#39;s spiritual leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3018932.stm">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> [BBC profile; <a href="http://www.leader.ir/langs/EN/index.php?p=bio">official profile</a>].

The ICHR has called for Iran&#39;s judiciary to investigate the death, with spokesperson Hadi Ghaemi saying, &quot;Iranian leaders have relegated the administration of the prison system to a group of incompetent and cruel officials who are showing their utter disregard for human life.&quot; <br /><br />While print journalists have long been <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=journalist+prison">imprisoned</a> [JURIST news archive] for producing unfavorable reports, the advent of blogging has resulted in a new group subject to sanctions for their reporting.

In September, the Singapore Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/singapore-court-sentences-us-blogger-to.php">sentenced US blogger Gopalan Nair</a>  [JURIST report] to three months in jail for insulting a judge.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/judconf.html">US Judicial Conference</a> [official website] has published a <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/library/codeOfConduct/Revised_Code_Effective_July-01-09.pdf">revised Code of Conduct</a> [text, PDF] for federal judges in the country. The revision, published Tuesday, updates the code from its <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/guide/vol2/ch1.cfm">last revision</a> [text] in 1992, and the conference said the changes were intended to simplify and clarify the code by condensing its sections and using plain language. The revised version also newly-defines the &quot;appearance of impropriety,&quot; the standard by which judges should recuse themselves from hearing a case, and broadens the definition of what constitutes inappropriate influence on a judge. Changes to the code will take effect on July 1. The conference also asked Congress to create 63 new federal judgeships.<br /><br />The US Judicial Conference is <a href="http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/2009/JCMems_March09.pdf">made up of</a> [membership roster, PDF] senior circuit and district court judges. It operates under a <a href="http://uscode.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00000331----000-.html">mandate</a> [28 USC &sect; 331] to monitor federal courts and promulgate rules providing for their fair and efficient operation. What constitutes the appearance of impropriety or bias by a judge is something that has recently gained much attention in both federal and state courts. Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-22.pdf">arguments</a> [argument transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-hears-judicial-recusal.php">report</a>] in a case where they will determine whether there is a constitutional basis for the Court to set an &quot;appearance of bias&quot; standard for state courts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will no longer prosecute owners of medical marijuana facilities that do not violate state law, <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] said Wednesday. Although the use of medical marijuana violates federal law, thirteen states have legalized its use. Holder warned, however, that the federal government would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iHs5ki4JKUS8Q5APCcU3bAjKv5TgD970QM080">continue to prosecute dispensers that violate state law</a> [AP report], including dispensers that are fronts for drug dealers. Senator <a href="http://grassley.senate.gov/">Chuck Grassley</a> (R-IA) [official website] <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iHs5ki4JKUS8Q5APCcU3bAjKv5TgD9714E8O2">opposed Holder&#39;s decision</a> [AP report], arguing that marijuana leads to harder drugs. Holder did not comment on whether the DOJ would continue to prosecute medical marijuana cases already underway. Also Wednesday, a bill legalizing medical marijuana in New Hampshire <a href="http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Panel+backs+medical+marijuana+use+in+NH&articleId=7e2bf89a-36b6-4f5a-b144-f3de2428bac6">survived a committee vote</a> [<em>Union Leader</em> report] in the <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/">state House of Representatives</a> [official website]. The house will vote on the bill next week.<br /><br />Under the Bush administration, the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/index.htm">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) [official website] routinely raided medical marijuana distributors because they violate federal law. The DEA raided medical marijuana facilities <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/05/dea-led-by-bush-continues-pot-raids/">as recently as February</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Times</span> report] to the disappointment of President Barack Obama, who, during his campaign, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/politics/primarysource/2007/08/all_democratic.html">pledged to end raids</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Boston Globe</span> report]. Michigan became the most recent state to legalize the use of medical marijuana by <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/michigan-massachusetts-approve.php">passing a proposition</a> [JURIST report] last November. The US Supreme Court&#39;s 2005 decision in <a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZS.html">Gonzales v. Raich</a> [opinion text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-supreme-court-sides-with.php">report</a>] upheld Congress&#39;s power to criminalize the growth and personal use of marijuana for medical purposes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=1">Supreme Court of Singapore</a> [official website] ruled Thursday that a <a href="http://www.wsj-asia.com/">Wall Journal Journal Asia</a> (WSJ-Asia) [media website] editor was in <a href="http://www.agc.gov.sg/docs/Media_Brief_AG_v_Melanie_Kirkpatrick.pdf">contempt of court and personally liable for damages</a> [press release, PDF] for publishing two editorials and a letter that criticized the impartiality of the city-state&#39;s judiciary. Judge Tay Yong Kwang ordered Melanie Kirkpatrick to pay USD $13,000 in fines and court costs for being in charge of the newspaper&#39;s editorial section when the articles were published. The <a href="http://www.agc.gov.sg/docs/AG_Submissions_AG_v_Melanie_Kirkpatrick.pdf">case</a> [complaint, PDF] is the second such contempt of court case brought by the Singapore <a href="http://www.agc.gov.sg/">attorney general</a> [official website] over the same articles. In October, Tay held that publisher Daniel Hertzberg and proprietor Christine Glancery, were in <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/singapore-judge-finds-wsj-asia-in.php">contempt of Court</a> [JURIST report] and fined them USD $16,500 plus court costs. In the complaint, the attorney general argued it was important to pursue contempt of court charges against individual members of the WSJ-Asia to serve as a deterrence against future such publications.<blockquote>The Applicant&#8217;s objective in bringing these proceedings against the Respondent is to ensure that the editor who is responsible for the publication of the 3 offending items in WSJ Asia is held accountable for her actions. The Applicant&#8217;s understanding of the representations from the Respondent&#8217;s solicitors that the Respondent is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the &#8216;Editorials and Opinion&#8217; section of the WSJ Asia and has final editorial responsibility over its contents is that the Respondent is directly responsible for the publication of the 3 offending items in WSJ Asia.</blockquote>Kirkpatrick did not contest the charges and the attorney general urged a stiff penalty against her, in light of a previous contempt of court fine against her for USD $2,600 in 1985. <br /><br />In July, the Singapore government <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/singapore-speaks-out-against-criticism.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] claims by the <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/IBAHRI.aspx">International Bar Association&#39;s Human Rights Division</a> [association website] that the country lacks an independent judiciary. In September, a Singapore Supreme Court judge sentenced US blogger and lawyer <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/">Gopalan Nair</a> [blog; firm <a href="http://www.us-immigrationlaw.com/att.html">profile</a>] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/singapore-court-sentences-us-blogger-to.php">three months in jail</a> [JURIST report] after he accused a judge &quot;prostituting herself&quot; in a defamation case brought by former Singapore prime minister <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.sg/AboutUs/Org-MP-MP-Prof-LeeKuanYew.htm">Lee Kuan Yew</a> [official profile]. The Singapore <a href="http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_getdata.pl?actno=1872-REVED-224&doctitle=PENAL%20CODE%0A&date=latest&method=part&sl=1&segid=888373001-001303#888373002-001588">penal code</a> [text] punishes insulting a public servant conducting a judicial proceeding with up to one year in prison, a fine, or both.

Judge Oscar Magi <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iFK6jJ12W23VZD-Hsw_RZIo67JnwD970DVV80">suspended the case</a> [AP report] in order to allow Italy&#39;s <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/index.asp">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] to explain its <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE52A6RK20090311">ruling last week</a> [Reuters report] excluding certain evidence from the case on the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/italy-asks-court-to-drop-kidnapping.php">grounds of national security</a> [JURIST report]. The case involves 25 American CIA agents and one US Air Force colonel being tried <font style="font-style:italic;">in absentia</font>, along with seven Italian military intelligence officials, who are charged in the 2003 abduction and <a href="/currentawareness/rendition.php">rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] of Egyptian cleric <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Nasr+egyptian+cleric">Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Constitutional Court had issued a ruling excluding key evidence based on prosecutors&#39; violations of national security laws when they obtained classified evidence of the identities of members of Italy&#39;s <a href="http://www.aisi.gov.it/pdcweb.nsf/pagine/sismi">Military Intelligence and Security Service</a> (SISMI) [official website, in Italian] and their relationships with US CIA agents. While the ruling is seen as damaging to the criminal case, lead prosecutor Armando Spataro said he <a href="http://www.easybourse.com/bourse-actualite/marches/italian-court-postpones-cia-kidnap-case-until-april-22-635954">approved</a> [AFP report] of the delay for clarification purposes.<br /><br />Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt&#39;s State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. The trial has been delayed many times through out its course. Most recently, Magi <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/italy-court-again-suspends-cia.php">delayed the trial for three months</a> [JURIST report] in December after the government said the testimony could compromise Italy&#8217;s national security.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official profile] told reporters Wednesday that the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will consider accepting in the US the 17 <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur Guantanamo Bay detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] who have been cleared for release. The DOJ is still exploring where to transfer cleared detainees, and has declined to repatriate the Uighurs despite <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-renews-demand-for-us-to-return.php">Chinese demands</a> [JURIST report] because they have been linked to a militant separatist group and could face torture upon their return. Holder&#39;s comments follow the February <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200902/08-5424-1165428.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/dc-circuit-rules-against-release-of.php">report</a>] of the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website], which rejected an October district court <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/files/2008-10-09%20Kiyemba%20corrected%20release%20order%20%282008-10-09%29.pdf">order</a> [opinion and order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/federal-judge-orders-release-of-uighurs.php">report</a>] supporting the US release of Uighurs. The circuit court reserved such a decision for either the executive or legislative branch.<br /><br />On Monday, Holder and other top officials from the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/eu-leaders-discuss-guantanamo-detainee.php">met with leaders</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] to discuss plans to transfer detainees from <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] to European countries, assuring EU leaders that the US will provide them with thorough background information about the detainees. In February, Sweden&#39;s Migration Court <a href="http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/lansrattenistockholm/Pressmeddelande/UM%206523-08.pdf">granted asylum</a> [judgment, PDF, in Swedish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sweden-court-grants-asylum-to-former.php">report</a>] to a former Uighur Guantanamo detainee, overruling a previous asylum denial. The city of Munich, Germany, home to a sizeable Uighur community, has expressed willingness to <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/national/20090206-17269.html">welcome the 17 Uighurs</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">The Local</span> report]. In 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">Albania granted asylum</a> [JURIST report] to five Uighurs after their release from Guantanamo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Thursday granted a <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2008cv2243-44">preliminary injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] against a <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=a15e32348cebc10c376f143260af317e&rgn=div8&view=text&node=50:6.0.1.2.10.4.1.2&idno=50">federal rule</a> [50 CFR &sect; 27.42 text] that permits the possession of &quot;concealed, loaded and operable&quot; hand guns in national parks and wildlife refuges in accordance with state laws. The rule was a enacted late in the term of former president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/georgewbush/">George W. Bush</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">news archive</a>]. Historically, the <a href="http://www.doi.gov/">Department of the Interior</a> [official website] (DOI) <a href="http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=781c4816d145962842284902e976cc27&rgn=div8&view=text&node=36:1.0.1.1.2.0.1.4&idno=36">permitted</a> [36 CFR &sect; 2.4(a)(2) text] only &quot;packed, cased or stored&quot; weapons to avoid ready use. The <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/">Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence</a> and the <a href="http://www.npca.org/">National Parks Conservation Association</a> [advocacy websites] brought suit claiming the DOI did not prepare an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement prior to enactment, pursuant to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00004331----000-.html">National Environmental Protection Act</a> [42 USC &sect; 4331 text]. The DOI argued the rule did not authorize environmental impacts, thus no study was needed. The court held the rule was a result of an &quot;astonishingly flawed process&quot; by the DOI and their defense invoking a categorical exclusion was &quot;arbitrary and capricious.&quot;<br /><br />This injunction follows a <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/emanuel-regulatory-review.pdf">memorandum</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/white-house-seeks-review-of-last-minute.php">report</a>] by White House Chief of Staff <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/staff/rahm_emanuel/">Rahm Emanuel</a> [official profile] to agency and department leaders requesting the review of pending regulations that were advanced late in the Bush administration. Additionally, <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/lawsuits-seek-to-overturn-gun-bans.php">challenges to firearm restrictions</a> [JURIST report] have become increasingly common since the Supreme Court&#39;s 5-4 decision in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/certgrants/2007/disvhel">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [Duke Law backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>], in which the Court affirmed a decision <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-dc.php">invalidating the District of Columbia handgun ban</a> [JURIST report]. <u>Heller</u> marked the first occasion that the Supreme Court directly addressed the Second Amendment since 1939&#39;s <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0307_0174_ZS.html">US v. Miller</a> [opinion].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK will publish the guidance it gives to intelligence officers for questioning suspects overseas, <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">Prime Minister Gordon Brown</a> [official website] told parliament in a <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090318/wmstext/90318m0001.htm#column_55WS">written statement</a> [text] Wednesday. Restating the UK&#39;s unequivocal condemnation of torture, Brown said that making the applicable interrogation standards public will &quot;protect the reputation of [UK] security and intelligence services and ... reassure ourselves that everything has been done to ensure that our practices are in line with United Kingdom and international law.&quot; The guidelines are expected to be published by May, following consolidation and review by the <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/intelligence.aspx">Intelligence and Security Committee</a> (ISC), a <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Cabinet Office</a> [official websites] committee set up to conduct oversight of UK intelligence activities. Brown charged Intelligence Services Commissioner Sir Peter Gibson with monitoring guideline compliance, continuing to resist <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/mar/19/mi5-terror-interrogations">calls for a judge-led inquiry</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span> report]. He noted that the civil courts are the appropriate place for allegations of criminal misconduct to be tried, but that decisions about prosecution must follow an investigation by the <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/">attorney general</a> [official website]. Brown also directed the ISC to update its <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/corp/assets/publications/reports/intelligence/treatdetainees.pdf">2005 detainee treatment report</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/corp/assets/publications/intelligence/20070725_isc_final.pdf">2007 rendition report</a> [text, PDF] in light of any new developments or relevant information. <br /><br />The decision comes amidst allegations from British resident and former <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7906381.stm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=binyam+mohamed">news archive</a>] that British intelligence agents were <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/guantanamo-ex-detainee-claims-memos.php">complicit in his torture</a> [JURIST report] in Morocco. Mohamed alleges that after being transferred to Morocco under the US <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] program, British <a href="http://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website] fed interrogation questions to Moroccan authorities. Earlier this month, the UK government&#39;s independent reviewer of terror laws <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/uk-anti-terrorism-reviewer-urges.php">called for a judicial inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into British complicity in US rendition and torture. British media reported that UN special rapporteur on torture Manfred Nowak told British ministers that <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-torture-investigator-warns-uk-over.php">MI5 may have been complicit</a> [JURIST report] in torture committed while detainees including Mohamed were in US custody. Mohamed <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php"> was returned to the UK</a> [JURIST report] in March following seven years of detention, including five at Guantanamo Bay, where he was held on charges of conspiring to commit terrorism. Those charges were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in October, but Mohamed remained in custody while US authorities considered filing new charges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/45cba2a3-f435-428f-aa8c-203b8bf5528c/1/doc/09-1025_so.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/45cba2a3-f435-428f-aa8c-203b8bf5528c/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [summary order, PDF] Friday that <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] must remain in jail as he awaits sentencing. The ruling affirms last week&#39;s ruling by the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] denying Madoff bail. The appeals court found:<blockquote>our review of the record confirms that the district court&#8217;s findings were sufficient under the circumstances of this case. The defendant&#8217;s age and his exposure to imprisonment are undisputed, and the court did not err in inferring an incentive to flee from these facts. Moreover, the district court&#8217;s finding that the defendant has the means - and therefore the ability - to flee was not clear error.</blockquote>Prosecutors are seeking a 150-year sentence. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 16.<br /><br />Last week, Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in federal court to all 11 <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2008/comp-madoff121108.pdf">charges of securities fraud</a> [complaint, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/sec-charges-former-nasdaq-chariman-with.php">report</a>]. In February, Madoff <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/madoff-reaches-agreement-with-sec-on.php">consented</a> [JURIST report] to a <a href="http://sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20889.htm">partial judgment</a> [SEC press release] with the US <a href="http://sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] over civil charges brought by the SEC to obtain a preliminary injunction and asset freeze against him.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Dutch court Monday convicted a former Rwandan Hutu for the 1994 killing of two Tutsi mothers and at least four of their children.  <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/joseph_mpambara_757.html">Joseph Mpambara</a> [TrialWatch profile], who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the killings, was allegedly a member of the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/interahamwe.htm">Interahamwe</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], an extremist Hutu militia that was responsible for the deaths of thousands of ethnic Tutsi during the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [HRW backgrounder]. Mpambara was tried in the Dutch national court under an agreement with the <a href="http://69.94.11.53/default.htm">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>], as Mpambara had lived in the Netherlands since 1998. Mpambara was also <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iUEXR8eRKJObpkMgyGhsISRXwHVgD973TKAG0">convicted</a> [AP report] of torturing a German-Rwandan couple and their child at a Hutu roadblock. Mpambara is the brother of <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/legal-procedures/obed_ruzindana_51.html">Obed Ruzindana</a> [TrialWatch profile] who was sentenced by the ICTR to 25 years imprisonment in 1999 on charges of genocide.<br /><br />The ICTR has made significant progress towards fulfilling its mandate of investigating and prosecuting humanitarian crimes arising from the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The ICTR&#39;s success  prompted the US State Department to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">praise</a> [JURIST report] the court&#39;s work in its most recent human rights report, released on in late February.  Also in February, the ICTR <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rwanda-tribunal-convicts-former-priest.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former priest and military chaplain <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Rukundo/index.htm">Emmanuel Rukundo</a> [case materials] to 25 years imprisonment after <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/PRESSREL/2009/587.html">convicting</a> [press release] him of genocide, crimes against humanity, and sexual assault. The contempt trial against a former ICTR defense investigator <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/ictr-begins-contempt-trial-of-former.php">began</a> earlier in February. In January, a former Rwandan justice official was <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rwanda-ex-justice-minister-sentenced-to.php">sentenced to life in prison </a> [JURIST reports] for his role in the 1994 genocide. Under UN <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/Resolutions/s-res-1503e.pdf">Security Council Resolution 1503 (2003)</a> [PDF text], it was supposed to complete all trials by the end of the year, and to complete all of its work, including appellate review, by 2010. In June 2008, however, the ICTR prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-seeks-more.php">asked the Council</a> [JURIST report] to extend the ICTR&#39;s mandate, noting that the recent arrests of several genocide suspects meant that the court would not have time to finish several first-instance cases until 2009.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The trial of the only captured gunman in the November 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7752003.stm">Mumbai terror attacks</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mumbai+terror+attack">news archive</a>], <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075633&type=News">Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab</a> [NDTV backgrounder], began on Monday. Kasab appeared before specially appointed judge M.L. Tahiliyani at the <a href="http://bombayhighcourt.nic.in/">Bombay High Court</a> [official website] via video conferencing from prison. Kasab <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=HomePage&id=46622a71-8dac-4d7a-b71a-25652ec38f22&ParentID=172beec0-92b4-4284-8373-8dc36c49e218&Headline=Kasab+admits+he+is+Pakistani%2c+wants+a+lawyer">confirmed</a> [<em>Hindustan Times</em> report] during questioning from Tahiliyani that he is from Faridkot in the Punjab area of Pakistan. The court also instructed Kasab that he would be <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7958513.stm">appointed a lawyer</a> [BBC report]. He is currently unrepresented as Indian laywers have refused to represent him. Kasab told the judge that he received a copy of the charge sheet explaining the 12 charges against him, which include murder and waging war against India. If convicted, Kasab will face a maximum sentence of death by hanging. The court will reconvene on March 30 to determine whether an extension is appropriate for security purposes in the prison.<br /><br />Last month, Pakistan officials <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-official-concedes-mumbai.php">conceded</a> [JURIST report] that the terrorist attacks were partially planned there. Pakistan also stated that the perpetrators <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/world/asia/13pstan.html?_r=1&hp">traveled by ship</a> [NYT report] from southern Pakistan to Mumbai, where they launched the attack from inflatable boats using outboard engines purchased in Karachi, Pakistan. One scholar suggested that an <a href="/forumy/2008/12/establishing-international-tribunal-for.php">international tribunal be formed</a> [JURIST op-ed] to prosecute persons involved in Mumbai attacks in order to avoid further complications to the already unstable relationship between Pakistan and India. In the wake of the attacks, Indian <a href="http://www.pmindia.nic.in/meet.htm">Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/india-pm-pushes-tougher-anti-terrorism.php">pushed for tougher anti-terrorism measures</a> [JURIST report]. The attacks in Mumbai, which claimed at least 170 lives, were carried out at ten locations across the city including the landmark <a href="http://www.tajhotels.com/Palace/The%20Taj%20Mahal%20Palace%20%26%20Tower%2CMUMBAI/default.htm">Taj Mahal Palace hotel</a> [hotel website]. The attacks were the worst the city has seen since a group of bombings killed more than 250 people in 1993.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chief of staff to former US secretary of state <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=colin+powell">Colin Powell</a> [JURIST news archive] Lawrence Wilkerson criticized US terrorism detention practices Thursday, saying that authorities were holding innocent civilians as terror suspects at the <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detention center. Wilkerson&#39;s comments echoed earlier statements he made on the blog <span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Notes</span>, entitled <a href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2009/03/some_truths_abo/">&quot;Some Truths About Guantanamo Bay&quot;</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Washington Notes</span> blog post], published online Tuesday. In the post, Wilkerson outlined a number of issues with the way in which prisoners sent to Guantanamo were detained, including the inability of US forces to distinguish between terrorism suspects and civilians, the use of bounty hunters to gather detainees, and the lack of judicial oversight of the detention process. Wilkerson faulted the administration of former president <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] for failing to acknowledge or quickly ameliorate the practices, attributing the failure to a desire to preserve the president&#39;s legacy and reputation. In an interview with the Associated Press, Wilkerson said that many of the detainees were <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ie2Gewi7L3__bSzBds095stmE88QD971FBSO1">victims of unfortunate circumstances</a> [AP report] and were handed over to US forces in exchange for money.<br /><br />Wilkerson&#39;s criticism of US terrorism policies comes as part of an increasing consensus concerning the perceived inadequacy and uselessness of the Guantanamo detention facility. In June, an <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/detainees/story/38773.html">investigative report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/many-guantanamo-bagram-detainees-have.php">report</a>] by <span style="font-style:italic;">McClatchy</span> Newspapers revealed that many Guantanamo detainees have no links to terrorism. The <span style="font-style:italic;">McClatchy</span> report echoed <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/lawyers-say-most-guantanamo-detainees.php">comments</a> [JURIST report] made in February 2006 by lawyers for two detainees who alleged that more than half of detainees held at Guantanamo have not committed terrorist acts or are not members of terrorist organizations. In November 2006, Seton Hall law professor <a href="http://law.shu.edu/faculty/fulltime_faculty/denbeama/denbeaux.html">Mark Denbeaux</a> [faculty profile] reported that <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Combatant_Tribunals.html">US military Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a> [DOD materials] do not offer Guantanamo detainees an adequate opportunity to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/guantanamo-combatant-status-reviews.php">contest the accusations against them</a> [JURIST report] or to object to their status as enemy combatants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The White House will soon make publicly available three internal memos from the Bush administration detailing aggressive interrogation techniques used against alleged top al Qaeda operatives, <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/">Newsweek</a> [media website] <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/190362">reported</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span> report] Saturday. These so-called <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=torture+memo">&quot;torture memos&quot;</a> [JURIST news archive] reportedly legally justify a number of interrogation techniques that some say amount to torture. The White House has decided to release the memos because an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Ensuring_Lawful_Interrogations/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-issues-torture-ban-orders-cia.php">report</a>] bringing an end to such techniques removes the need to keep the memos confidential. Current and former intelligence officials have argued against the memos&#39; release, warning that this could compromise national security.<br /><br />Last week, an <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22530">article</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/red-cross-deemed-cia-interrogation.php">report</a>] published in the <font style="font-style:italic;">New York Review of Books</font> said that the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] characterized CIA tactics used against terrorism suspects as constituting torture in a confidential 2007 report. The report, obtained by journalist Mark Danner, alleges that some of the techniques used included <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=waterboarding">waterboarding</a> [JURIST news archive], sleep deprivation, prolonged nudity, and cold water immersion. Earlier this month, Attorney General Eric Holder <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/us-ag-holder-reaffirms-no-waterboarding.php">reaffirmed</a> [JURIST report] the US government&#39;s commitment not to use waterboarding. Also that day, the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] released a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/doj-releases-bush-administration-memos.php">several memoranda and opinions</a> [JURIST report] from the Bush White House supporting the administration&#39;s counter terrorism policies.  The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/38511prs20090128.html">lawsuit</a> [ACLU press release] under the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [5 USC &sect; 552 text] in January compelling the DOJ to turn over these and other memos.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.osdbx.com/Katrina/PDF/DFE_Order.pdf">denied</a> [order, PDF] a motion by the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> (USACE) [official website] to dismiss a  <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/CanalCases/CanalCases.htm">lawsuit</a> [materials] brought by Louisiana homeowners for damages suffered as a result of flooding during <a href="/currentawareness/katrinadisaster.php">Hurricane Katrina</a> [JURIST news archive] in 2005. The plaintiffs, five homeowners who brought suit in 2007, argue that the Corps was negligent in its protection of flood-prone Louisiana areas due to defects in the <a href="http://mrgo.usace.army.mil/default.aspx?p=MRGOInfo">Mississippi River Gulf Outlet</a> (MRGO) [USACE backgrounder]. The Corps filed a motion to dismiss the case based on the theory that the MRGO defects were caused by the Corps&#39; discretionary functions, which are immune from lawsuit under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002680----000-.html">discretionary function exception</a> [28 USC &sect; 2680] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/ch171.html">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> [text]. In denying the government&#39;s motion to dismiss the lawsuit and allowing the case to proceed to trial, Judge Stanwood Duval wrote<blockquote>Plaintiffs sought to preclude the government from raising the discretionary function exception based on the first inquiry required for its application - that certain federal statutes, regulations and policies specifically prescribed a course of action for the Corps to follow and that the Corps had no choice but to adhere to those directives. The Court has found that the [Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act] does not provide such a bar; however, with respect to teh [National Environmental Policy Act], Plaintiffs demonstrated that there are material questions of fact that the Corps itself had found that the environmental damage caused by the maintenance and operation of the MRGO was significant, such that it had no choice but to file the appropriate mandated reports. As such, if the Court is convinced at trial that the Corps indeed violated a mandate and is precluded from its protection, then Plaintiffs will still bear the burden to prove that this failure caused the damages sought.</blockquote>Duval previously allowed the lawsuit to proceed in May 2008, when he <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-rejects-latest-katrina.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that that the outlet was a shipping channel and not a flood control outlet in connection with which the Corps would have been properly immune in tort, and rejected the Corps&#39; argument that the MRGO was nonetheless part of a larger flood control system in the New Orleans area. Duval made a <a href="/pcbackup/2007/02/federal-judge-allows-katrina-flooding.php">similar ruling</a> [JURIST report] in February 2007 in the context of an earlier motion to dismiss. Three months before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, an expert at the <a href="http://hurricane.lsu.edu/">LSU Hurricane Center</a> [official website] predicted that the MRGO could amplify storm surges by 20-40 percent. After Katrina, the center determined through computer modeling that the presence of the MRGO also increased the speed of the surge, causing an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301200_pf.html">even greater detrimental effect</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The<a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/principal/principal.asp"> Brazilian Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Portuguese] on Thursday <a href="http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=105036">confirmed the rights of indigenous peoples</a> [press release, in Portuguese] to land on the <a href="http://www.estadao.com.br/especiais/a-disputa-pela-raposa-serra-do-sol,17895.htm">Raposa Serra do Sol</a> [<em>Estadao</em> backgrounder, in Portuguese] reservation and set out 19 rules to guide court in similar cases in the future. The <a href="http://blog.estadao.com.br/blog/temporeal/?title=demarcacao_da_raposa_e_continua_e_arroze&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1">10 to 1 ruling</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Estadao</span> report, in Portuguese] will permit the expulsion of the 200 rice farmers currently living and working on the Raposa Serra do Sol reservation, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/americas/4450755.stm">created in 2005</a> [BBC report] by the Brazilian government. The rules set out by the court include prohibiting those outside the indigenous communities from hunting, fishing, gathering, or practicing agriculture on the land and granting exclusive use of natural resources to members of the tribal groups. The rules are <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/20/Court_protects_Indian_reservations/UPI-57411237556379/">expected to be binding</a> [UPI report] on any future legal case involving the use of indigenous lands, which cover 12% of Brazil. <br /><br />In December, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/brazil-court-postpones-decision-on.php">indicated that they would rule in favor of the indigenous peoples</a> [JURIST report], but gave no official ruling. At the time, eight of the eleven judges voted in favor of indigenous peoples, but one requested more time to deliberate. Because of the high likelihood of victory, indigenous peoples began celebrating immediately.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] reiterated his position&nbsp;that US policies governing the detention and interrogation of <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees should comport with due process and international law requirements in a Sunday<font style="font-style: italic; ">&nbsp;</font><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/18/60minutes/main4873938_page4.shtml">interview</a>&nbsp;[CBS interview transcript] with&nbsp;<font class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; ">60 Minutes</font>. Obama said that polices of the former Bush administration, which gave less deference to these norms, did not effectively help the US bring terrorists to justice but instead generated anti-American sentiment abroad. He said that terrorism suspects would still have to be treated seriously, that they were specifically not due <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/miranda_rights"><font style="font-style:italic;">Miranda</font> rights</a> [LII backgrounder], and that the country could not release individuals who still post a threat to the US. Obama said that despite these concerns, he&nbsp;believed detainees&#39; treatment could effectively be governed under existing US and international regimes.<br /><br />Obama&#39;s remarks came in response to&nbsp;earlier&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/15/cheney.interview/index.html?iref=newssearch">criticism</a>&nbsp;[CNN report] by&nbsp;former vice president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3344815.stm">Dick Cheney</a> [BBC profile] of&nbsp;Obama&#39;s call to close Guantanamo by 2010. In January, Obama issued an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] freezing the <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html">military commission</a> [DOD materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=military+commissions">news archive</a>] system, calling for the review of US judicial policy towards the detainees, and directing the closure of Guantanamo within one year. The Department of Justice has also more recently <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-doj-drops-enemy-combatant.php">eliminated</a> [JURIST report] the use of the term &quot;enemy combatant&quot; in a symbolic departure from Bush administration policies.

The amendment will allow political events to be <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/417126/1/.html">recorded live</a> [CNA report] and will permit documentaries and biographies of political figures as long as they are factual and objective. Politicians running for office can now use films as a medium to promote their candidacy. Films that still remain prohibited involve any parodies of government or politics. Currently there are steep fines of $73,000 or two years in prison for anyone in violation of the act.<br /><br />Singapore has a history of restricting free speech, particularly speech critical of the government. Last week, a judge in Singapore <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/singapore-judge-fines-wsj-asia-editor.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://www.wsj-asia.com/">Wall Journal Journal Asia</a> [media website] editor was in contempt of court and personally liable for damages for publishing two editorials and a letter that criticized the impartiality of the city-state&#39;s judiciary. She was subsequently fined. In September, the Singapore Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/singapore-court-sentences-us-blogger-to.php">sentenced US blogger Gopalan Nair</a> [JURIST report] to three months in jail for insulting a judge.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal jury at the <a href="http://www.prd.uscourts.gov/CourtWeb/Welcome.aspx">US District Court for the District of Puerto Rico</a> [official website] on Friday found former Puerto Rican governor <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Anibal+Acevedo+Vila">Anibal Acevedo Vila</a> [JURIST news archive] not guilty on nine counts of conspiracy, false statements, and wire fraud, among other crimes. The charges stem from alleged violations of the <a href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&dbname=cp106&&r_n=hr756.106&sel=TOC_315131&">Federal Election Campaign Act</a> [text] during Vila&#39;s 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 campaigns to become Puerto Rico&#39;s Resident Commissioner in the US House of Representatives and his 2004 gubernatorial campaign. In the original <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/March/crm-indictment-03272008.pdf">indictment</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/puerto-rico-governor-indicted-on-27.php">report</a>], prosecutors accused Vila and twelve others of authorizing illegal and unreported contributions to pay off debts in excess of $500,000 incurred during Vila&#39;s campaigns.  <br /><br />Vila is a member of the <a href="http://www.ppdpr.net/">Popular Democratic Party</a> [party website, in Spanish], which does not support full US statehood for the Commonwealth.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Lawyers for five <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=uighur">Uighur</a> [JURIST news archive] detainees at <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] on Friday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/parhat-renewed-motion-3-20-09.pdf">moved</a> [motion, PDF; similar <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/abdusemet-contempt-mtn-3-20-09.pdf">motion</a> in related case] to have Defense Secretary <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=115">Robert Gates</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=robert+gates">news archive</a>] held in contempt after failing to have them freed or transferred. The motions refer to a June 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/federal-appeals-court-overturns-enemy.php">order</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] requiring that the Uighurs be transferred, released, or given a new Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT). The motions state that Gates has conceded that the government will not convene a new CSRT and claims that the difficulty of finding a proper country for transfer is a problem of the government&#39;s making. Since there is no dispute that Gates is able to comply with the order, the motions argue, he should be held in contempt. The motions assert that deferring to Gates&#39; status as an officer in the executive branch would render the judicial power &quot;hollow.&quot;<br /><br />US Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters Wednesday that the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] would <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/uighur-guantanamo-detainees-may-be.php">consider accepting</a> [JURIST report] in the US the 17 Uighur detainees who have been cleared for release. The DOJ has declined to repatriate the Uighurs despite <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/china-renews-demand-for-us-to-return.php">Chinese demands</a> [JURIST report] because they could face torture upon their return. On Monday, Holder and other top officials from the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/eu-leaders-discuss-guantanamo-detainee.php">met with leaders</a> [JURIST report] from the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] to discuss plans to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay. In February, Sweden&#39;s Migration Court <a href="http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/lansrattenistockholm/Pressmeddelande/UM%206523-08.pdf">granted asylum</a> [judgment, PDF, in Swedish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sweden-court-grants-asylum-to-former.php">report</a>] to a former Uighur Guantanamo detainee. Munich, Germany, home to a sizeable Uighur community, has expressed willingness to <a href="http://www.thelocal.de/national/20090206-17269.html">welcome the 17 Uighurs</a> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Local</span> report]. In 2006, <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/albania-agrees-to-accept-chinese.php">Albania granted asylum</a> [JURIST report] to five Uighurs after their release from Guantanamo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-23-09.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/march09.shtml">briefs</a>] Monday in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-67.pdf">Yeager v. United States</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], in which the Court will consider whether a criminal defendant can face new prosecution for counts on which a jury did not reach a verdict but that are related to other counts of which the defendant has been acquitted. Petitioner F. Scott Yeager was a former <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">Enron</a> [JURIST news archive] executive who was charged with wire fraud, securities fraud, insider trading, money laundering, and conspiracy to engage in securities fraud and wire fraud. A jury acquitted Yeager of the conspiracy, securities fraud, and wire fraud charges, but failed to reach a verdict on the insider trading and money laundering charges. Prosecutors then issued another indictment charging Yeager with money laundering and insider trading. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C06/06-20691-CV0.wpd.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] the district court&#39;s denial of Yeager&#39;s motion to dismiss the charges. There has been a circuit split on whether such a prosecution violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/amdt5afrag2_user.html#amdt5a_hd7">Double Jeopardy Clause</a> [LII backgrounder] of the Fifth Amendment. At oral arguments, counsel for Yeager argued that, &quot;Unlike acquittals, hung counts are not verdicts. They decide nothing, and therefore a hung count cannot be inconsistent with an acquittal.&quot; Counsel for the state argued:<blockquote>[T]he government may, under the doctrine of continuing jeopardy, try to obtain a verdict when a jury is hung. The basic principle there is that the government is entitled to one full and fair opportunity to convict and that the hung counts, when the jury cannot agree, interrupt and prevent the government from achieving that. Double jeopardy therefore does not bar the government from completing its opportunity to obtain a verdict.</blockquote>

At a Kathmandu news conference concluding her five-day visit to Nepal, Pillay cited abuses including the failure of Nepal&#39;s commissions on disappearances and truth and reconciliation to ensure justice for victims of abuse and recent &quot;arbitrary actions&quot; taken against journalists and other human rights activists. Pillay said:<blockquote>The demands of victims&#39; families are not mere wishes they are supported by law. And until these demands for justice are fulfilled and accountability for past, and in particular ongoing, violations is ensured, a truly new Nepal will not emerge, and indeed, the peace process could be jeopardised.</blockquote>Pillay is <a href="http://www.kantipuronline.com/capsule.php?&nid=185803">seeking a three year extension</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Kantipur</span> report] of the <a href="http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/index.html">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal</a> (OHCHR-Nepal) [official website] in order to &quot;address the remaining challenges.&quot;<br /><br />The decade-long Maoist guerrilla insurgency that left more than 13,000 people dead <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/nepal-peace-deal-ends-decade-long.php">ended</a> [JURIST report] in late 2006 when the Nepalese government signed a peace agreement that established the Nepalese <a href="http://www.nepalcaportal.org/EN/">Constituent Assembly</a> (CA) [official website]. In November, the CA <a href="http://www.nepalcaportal.org/EN/news/details.php?id=972">announced</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/nepal-assembly-pledges-to-finish-draft.php">report</a>] that it will finish drafting the country&#39;s new constitution within 18 months. In May, the CA <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/nepal-constituent-assembly-abolishes.php">voted to abolish the country&#39;s monarchy</a> [JURIST report], giving King Gyanendera 15 days to abandon his royal palace, which cleared the way for Maoists to serve in government.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar of the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] retired Saturday, paving the way for the official reinstatement of his predecessor, deposed Chief Justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry</a> [JURIST news archive]. Chaudhry will <a href="http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/3F8701C744D01C7E652575800038049E?OpenDocument">re-assume the office of Chief Justice</a> [PTI report] Sunday. Dogar left the court Friday without receiving a full reception from the court&#39;s judges and staff, normally a sign of respect given in honor of the retiring judge&#39;s service to the court. The lack of a ceremony to commemorate Dogar&#39;s departure was <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/chief-justice-hameed-dogar-retires-today--za">indicative of the acrimony</a> [<em>Dawn</em> report] existing between Dogar and other members of the Pakistani judiciary. Dogar took the office of Chief Justice following then-president Pervez Musharraf&#39;s November 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/pakistan-high-court-battles-musharraf.php">declaration of emergency law</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/musharraf-swears-in-new-pakistan-chief.php">removal of Chaudhry</a> [JURIST report].<br /><br />Dogar&#39;s retirement marks the end of a tumultuous week in Pakistan. Following a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-ex-pm-leads-march-for-judges.php">protest and long march</a> [JURIST report] led by the Pakistan <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=pakistan+lawyers+movement">lawyers&#39; movement</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website] leader, former deputy prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6959782.stm">Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>], <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=asif+ali+zardari">news archive</a>] announced the imminent <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-ousted-chief-justice-to-be.php">reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] of Chaudry. The news of Chaudhry&#39;s reinstatement was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-lawyers-supporters-welcome.php">met with jubilation</a> [JURIST report] by Pakistan lawyers and opposition supporters, as well as by Western governments and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-praises-reinstatement.php">United Nations</a> [JURIST report]. On Thursday, the federal government, led by Zardari&#39;s <a href="http://www.ppp.org.pk/">Pakistan Peoples Party</a> (PPP) [party website] filed an <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-government-appeals-high-court.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a February Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pakistan-supreme-court-bars-ex-pm.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] banning Sharif and his brother from holding elected office because of a past criminal conviction.

In a new <a href="/pdf/phrgazareport.pdf">report</a> [PDF] the group accused the IDF of preventing the sick and wounded from evacuating homes and medical facilities in pursuit of better treatment during the offensive, leading to otherwise preventable deaths. PHR also said it had&nbsp;received&nbsp;reports of the IDF attacking ambulances, medical teams and medical facilities. In a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.who.int/hac/crises/international/wbgs/gaza_early_health_assessment_16feb09.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;[text, PDF]&nbsp;published last month, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.who.int/en/">World Health Organization </a>(WHO) [advocacy website] estimated&nbsp;that 1,380 Palestinians and 16 medical workers were killed during the offensive and at least 5,380&nbsp;Palestinians&nbsp;and 25 were injured.&nbsp;<br /><br />The IDF&#39;s conduct during the offensive has been scrutinized by a number of human rights advocacy groups. Last week, a group of 16 human rights investigators and judges sent an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.nz/archived_news/experts_seek_gaza_inquiry+">open letter</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/human-rights-leaders-call-for.php">report</a>] to UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ban+ki-moon">news archive</a>] and the UN Security Council calling for an investigation into alleged war crimes.&nbsp;In January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D78B7DAC697D3060C1257539003B5F3A?opendocument">called for an independent investigation</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-head-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] of possible war crimes and human rights violations in Gaza. <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is also <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/palestinian-leaders-urge-icc.php">attempting to gain jurisdiction over Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its actions in Gaza for alleged war crimes.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/08-1352.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion; PDF] as procedural three rules promulgated by the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> (USPTO) [official website] that significantly alter the patent application process, overturning a fourth rule. The four rules, which would have retroactively limited the number of claims that can be included in a patent application and the number of times a continuation application can be filed for a given invention, were <a href="http://ipwatchdog.com/GSK_v_PTO/gsk_uspto_decision.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-court-strikes-down-new-patent.php">report</a>] by the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] in April on the grounds that they altered the substantive rights of the intellectual property applicants set forth under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/patent/patent.overview.html">US Patent Act</a> [35 USC &sect;&sect; 1-376 text]. The circuit court relied on the framework set forth by the US Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0467_0837_ZS.html">Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council</a> [opinion] to establish that deference is extended to the USPTO in its interpretation of the Patent Act for the purposes of determining procedural standards. The court then upheld Rules 17, 114, and 265, classifying the rules as procedural:<blockquote>While we do not purport to set forth a definitive rule for distinguishing between substance and procedure in this case, we conclude that the Final Rules challenged in this case are procedural. In essence, they govern the timing of and materials that must be submitted with patent applications. The Final Rules may &quot;alter the manner in which the parties present ... their viewpoints&quot; to the USPTO, but they do not, on their face, &quot;foreclose effective opportunity&quot; to present patent applications for examination.</blockquote>The three affirmed rules were remanded in order to determine whether they are impermissibly vague. Rule 78, which the court ruled was also procedural, was struck down because it was found to be contrary to section 120 of the Patent Act. <br /><br />The district court <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/virginia/vaedce/1:2007cv00846/221151/50/0.pdf">preliminarily enjoined</a> [order; PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-blocks-new-us-patent.php">report</a>] the rules in October 2007, finding that the rules were substantive, rather than procedural, and thus beyond the scope of the USPTO&#39;s authority to promulgate. Since the preliminary injunction was issued, USPTO employees have continued to process and examine patent applications under the old rules and procedures. The <a href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/patents/SmithKline_Complaint-100907.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging the new rules was brought by pharmaceutical company <a href="http://www.gsk.com/">GlaxoSmithKline</a> [corporate website], which has approximately 100 applications pending at the USPTO. Supporting the company was the <a href="http://www.aipla.org/">American Intellectual Property Law Association</a> (AIPLA) [advocacy website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israel unlawfully and extensively used <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/wp.htm">white phosphorous</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] munitions in their recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Gaza+conflict">Gaza</a> [JURIST news archive] offensive, according to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iopt0309web.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Wednesday by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. The report maintains that while white phosphorous is allowed to be used to obscure ground operations in open areas and against military targets, international law prohibits air-bursting the shells over populated areas due to the risk it poses to civilians. According to the report, <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israeli Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] fired these munitions over homes, apartment buildings, a hospital, a school being used for shelter and other civilian-occupied buildings, causing deaths, injuries and property destruction. The report further alleges that the white phosphorous munitions being used were provided by the US government, calling for the US to cease transfers of white phosphorous to Israel and to conduct an investigation into whether or not such use violated international law. The report also calls on the <a href="http://www.un.org/">UN</a> [official website] to conduct public investigations. The report states that:<blockquote>The unlawful use of white phosphorus was neither incidental nor accidental. It was repeated over time and in different locations, with the IDF &quot;air-bursting&quot; the munition in populated areas up to the last days of its military operation. Even if intended as an obscurant rather than as a weapon, the IDF&#39;s repeated firing of  air-burst white phosphorus shells from 155mm artillery into densely populated areas was indiscriminate and indicates the commission of war crimes.</blockquote>According to the report, Israel had access to safer alternative means of obscuring ground operations such as smoke munitions but failed to use them instead of the white phosphorous shells. The IDF <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/03/2502.htm">responded</a> [press release] to the report Wednesday, saying that, &quot;based on the findings to date, it is already possible to conclude that the IDF&#39;s use of smoke shells was in accordance with international law.&quot;<br /><br />On Tuesday, a spokesman for Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Ehud Olmert</a> [official website] and the US State department <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-us-criticize-biased-un-rights.php">criticized</a> a recent <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-rights-council-condemns-israel.php">UN report</a> [JURIST reports] that condemned Israel&#39;s actions in Gaza, calling it biased. Human rights advocates have called for the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/human-rights-leaders-call-for.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] of recent events in Gaza, and Israel has promised to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-military-orders-internal.php">conduct their own investigation</a> [JURIST report] into possible war crimes committed by their soldiers. In January, <a href="http://www.ai.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy group] accused Israel of <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">unlawfully using white phosphorous</a> [JURIST report] in Gaza.  White phosphorous use may fall under the international <a href="http://www.ccwtreaty.com/keydocs.html">Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons</a> [text] as an incendiary weapon.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A substantial increase in the number of immigrants detained by the US over the last decade and the length of their detentions &quot;falls short of international human rights law,&quot; according to a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/uploads/JailedWithoutJustice.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; AI <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/immigrant-detention/jailed-without-justice-executive-summary/page.do?id=1641033">executive summary</a>] released Wednesday by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]. AI reported that the number of immigrants detained by US <a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigrations and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE) [official website] officials has tripled since 1996 to reach a daily detention capacity of 30,000. Those in custody include not just suspected immigration violators but also asylum seekers, survivors of torture and human trafficking, children, legal permanent residents, and parents of US citizens. The report found that immigrant detainees are commonly held for months or years without individualized hearings reviewing the legitimacy of detention, in violation of the ban on arbitrary detention established by Article 9 of the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. AI found that the vast majority of immigrant detainees are unable to secure legal assistance, and that approximately 67 percent of immigrant detainees are currently being held in state and county jails alongside criminals. Many of these facilities have been criticized for human rights violations such as excessive use of restraints and inadequate medical attention. AI presented several <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/immigrant-detention/jailed-without-justice-key-findings/page.do?id=1641032">key recommendations</a> [text] to restore human rights protection:<blockquote>1. The US Congress should pass legislation creating a presumption against the detention of immigrants and asylum seekers and ensuring that it be used as a measure of last resort.<br />2. The US government should ensure that alternative non-custodial measures, such as reporting requirements or an affordable bond, are always explicitly considered before resorting to detention. Reporting requirements should not be unduly onerous, invasive or difficult to comply with, especially for families with children and those of limited financial means. Conditions of release should be subject to judicial review.<br />3. The US Congress should pass legislation to ensure that all immigrants and asylum seekers have access to individualized hearings on the lawfulness, necessity, and appropriateness of detention.<br />4. The US government should ensure the adoption of enforceable human rights detention standards in all detention facilities that house immigration detainees, either through legislation or through the adoption of enforceable policies and procedures by the Department of Homeland Security. There should be effective independent oversight to ensure compliance with detention standards and accountability for any violations. </blockquote>The ICE&#39;s border control efforts have come under fire in recent months. Last week, an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j13P7QBc_QTYx0vi9mlryJ1-WUdwD96US8LO0">AP report</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/us-detaining-record-number-of.php">report</a>] highlighted the increased number of detainees and the extended period of time that individuals have faced detention, noting that though the average detention period is 31 days, nearly 10,000 detainees have been in custody for longer. Last month, the ICE&#39;s tactics during the Bush administration were <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/bush-immigration-enforcement-policies.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] by the Cardozo School of Law&#39;s <a href="http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/MemberContentDisplay.aspx?ccmd=ContentDisplay&ucmd=UserDisplay&userid=84&contentid=7356">Immigration Justice Clinic</a> [official website] for being overly-aggressive and ineffective. Secretary of Homeland Security <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Janet Napolitano</a> [official profile] issued a <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1233353528835.shtm">directive</a> [text] in January calling for review and assessment of the ICE fugitive operation teams.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Suspected al Qaeda operative <a href="http://www.ilcd.uscourts.gov/media/">Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri</a> [case materials; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=ali+al-marri">news archive</a>] pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of providing material support to al Qaeda, and his trial date was set for May 26. At an arraignment hearing before the <a href="http://www.ilcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Central District of Illinois</a> [official website], Judge Michael Mihm also made several evidentiary rulings. Mihn acknowledged that the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-enemy-combatant-24mar24,0,7168955.story">trial start date will likely be pushed back</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune</span> report], but still expects the trial to begin this sometime this year. An April 14 date was set for a <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/almarri/x110661800/Al-marri-pleads-not-guilty">review of evidence submitted</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Peoria Star Journal</span> report]. <br /><br />Last week, a South Carolina judge ruled that al-Marri must <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-orders-al-marri-to-remain.php">remain in prison</a> [JURIST report] during his trial, holding that he had not proven he was not a danger to the community. Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/030609zr.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/supreme-court-dismisses-al-marri-enemy.php">report</a>] a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/motion-to-dismiss-al-marri.pdf">motion</a> [text, PDF] by the US government to dismiss as moot an appeal challenging al-Marri&#39;s indefinite detention, following the Obama administration&#39;s decision to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/enemy-combatant-al-marri-to-be-tried-in.php">try al-Marri in US federal court</a> [JURIST report]. Al-Marri was <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/nytimes/docs/terrorism/usalmarri22609ind.html">indicted</a> [indictment text; DOJ <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/February/09-ag-177.html">press release</a>] earlier this month on two charges of providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring with others to provide material support to al Qaeda. In January, shortly after taking office, President Barack Obama ordered an <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-immediate-review-of.php">immediate review</a> [JURIST report] of al-Marri&#39;s detention. Al-Marri was arrested at his home in Peoria, Illinois by civilian authorities in 2001, and was indicted for other crimes. In 2003, then-President George W. Bush <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/23/qatar.combatant/">declared him an enemy combatant</a> [CNN report] and ordered the attorney general to transfer custody of al-Marri to the defense secretary, claiming inherent authority to hold him indefinitely. Until recently, al-Marri was detained on a US Navy brig in South Carolina.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/pub/rulings/cv/2005/05cv366mofinal.pdf">overturned</a> [memorandum and order, PDF] Monday a US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] decision to limit the over-the-counter (OTC) availability of the <a href="http://www.go2planb.com/ForConsumers/Index.aspx">Plan B emergency contraceptive pill</a> [product backgrounder] to women over the age of 18. In 2006, the FDA <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/fda-approves-over-counter-sale-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the OTC sale of the Plan B contraceptive  to women 18 years old and older, but included a controversial provision that required a doctor&#39;s prescription for women under 18 years old. The court agreed with the plaintiffs&#39; assertions that the FDA&#39;s decisions regarding limiting the OTC sale to women over 18 &quot;were arbitrary and capricious because they were not the result of reasoned and good faith agency decision-making.&quot; In overturning the FDA&#39;s decision and remanding the matter to the agency for further deliberation on OTC usage of the medication, Judge Edward Korman wrote:<blockquote>When a court reviewing an agency decision rules in favor of the plaintiff, it generally remands to the agency rather than granting affirmative relief. Certain circumstances, however, warrant exception to this general remand rule. Where a court has found that an agency decision is not supported by the record, but &quot;the record has been fully developed,&quot; remand would fail to &quot;serve a useful purpose.&quot; ...<br /><br />A remand would serve no purpose with respect to one aspect of the FDA&#8217;s decision &#8211; requiring that 17 year olds obtain a prescription for Plan B. The record is clear: the FDA&#8217;s justification for the denial of OTC access to Plan B for women over the age of 17 &#8211; rather than 18 &#8211; &quot;runs counter to the evidence&quot; and &quot;is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.&quot;</blockquote>The court ordered the FDA to make Plan B available to 17-year-olds without a prescription and remanded for further consideration on whether the contraceptive should be available OTC to women under the age of 17.<br /><br />The Plan B contraceptive has been the subject of considerable legislative and judicial activity since winning approval from the FDA in 2006. In March 2008, a federal judge in the US District Court of the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a physicians&#39; group against the FDA seeking to overturn approval of the OTC sale of Plan B. In November 2007, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-blocks-washington.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] a Washington state law that would have required pharmacists to dispense the Plan B pill. In October 2007, Illinois pharmacists <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">considered a settlement</a> [JURIST report] to a dispute over a state law that would have required them to dispense the Plan B pill regardless of their moral objections to the contraception.

The <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/25/content_11072195.htm">lawsuit</a> [<em>Xinhua</em> report], which was brought by the family of one of the children who fell ill last year, seeks more than USD $4,500 from the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/china-court-declares-tainted-milk-dairy.php">now-bankrupt</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/be63a6/shijiazhuang_sanlu">Sanlu Group</a> [Research and Markets profile]. The Xinhua District Court is the first court to accept a lawsuit on the scandal since the Chinese courts announced that earlier this month that they <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/china-courts-to-hear-tainted-milk.php">would allow</a> [JURIST report] such suits. Prior to the announcement the Chinese government had sponsored a <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/china-dairy-companies-to-pay-160.php">compensation plan</a> [JURIST report] that paid families between USD $290 and $29,000.<br /><br />Two people were <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-court-sentences-2-to-death-over.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] in January for their roles in the scandal that killed six children and sickened nearly 300,000 others. Earlier that month, lawyers for the families of 213 Chinese children sickened or killed by the contaminated milk <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-lawyers-file-class-action-lawsuit.php">petitioned</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme People&#39;s Court to hear a class action lawsuit against 22 dairy companies involved in the contamination, seeking more than $5 million in damages. In January, police in China <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/china-police-detain-parents-of-children.php">detained five parents</a> [JURIST report] of children who became sick after drinking melamine-tainted milk, preventing the parents from participating in a news conference.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesman for Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng">Prime Minister Ehud Olmert</a> [official website] Tuesday derided a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.20.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-military-orders-internal.php">report</a>] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] that accused Israel of human rights violations during its recent <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-rights-council-condemns-israel.php">military operations in Gaza</a> [JURIST report]. The report, authored by UN Special Rapporteur <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/1ce874ab1832a53e852570bb006dfaf6/0da4ba56ade85249852574190058d462!OpenDocument">Richard Falk</a> [appointment release], criticized Israel for failing to take adequate precautions to distinguish between civilians and combatants in their offensives in the region, and called for an independent investigation to determine whether Israel committed war crimes. Olmert spokesman Mark Regev told AFP Tuesday that the report was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJxoZtgvsr9N8aU_PJgnjxVYHnKg">one-sided and politically motivated</a> [AFP report], adding that Israel denies committing any war crimes. <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israeli Defense Force</a> (IDF) [official website] Chief of Staff <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/about/staff/gabi_ashkenazi.htm">Lt. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi</a> [official profile] maintained that Israeli soldiers <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3690794,00.html">acted morally</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Ynet News</span> report] throughout the conflict, noting that an internal investigation is underway. A US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] spokesman echoed Israel&#39;s view that the report was <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2009/03/120774.htm">biased</a> [DOS press briefing; AFP <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1o3-ACYLyxdOfVRPiam5NG5G5zg">report</a>], calling the rapporteur&#39;s views &quot;anything but fair.&quot;<br /><br />The IDF&#39;s conduct during the Gaza offensive has been heavily criticized by various rights groups. On Monday, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/rights-group-claims-israel-military.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the IDF of violating its own code of ethics and general principles of human rights by impeding the treatment of those who needed medical care during the conflict. Last week, a group of 16 human rights investigators and judges sent an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.nz/archived_news/experts_seek_gaza_inquiry+">open letter</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/human-rights-leaders-call-for.php">report</a>] to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and the UN Security Council calling for an investigation into alleged Israeli war crimes. In January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D78B7DAC697D3060C1257539003B5F3A?opendocument">called for an independent investigation</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-head-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] of possible war crimes and human rights violations in Gaza. <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is reportedly <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/palestinian-leaders-urge-icc.php">exploring whether the ICC has jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] to launch war crimes prosecutions in connection with the Gaza incidents. Israel has already <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/israel-pm-asks-justice-minister-to.php">begun to consider defenses against possible war crimes charges</a>, partly based on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">claims</a> [JURIST reports] that it used white phosphorus in a civilian area.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/">Vermont State Senate</a> [official website] voted 26-4 Monday to <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/journal/SJ090323.pdf#page=75 [http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/journal/SJ090323.pdf#page=75]">approve</a> [Senate journal, PDF] <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. This was the second of three readings of the <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/bills/Intro/S-115.pdf">proposed bill</a> [S.0115 text, PDF], entitled &#8220;An Act to Protect Religious Freedom and Promote Equality in Civil Marriage.&quot; Senator Kevin Mullin (R) brought an alternative motion for an advisory referendum to take place in the March 2010 elections asking the general public whether &quot;the General Assembly [shall] amend the laws of the state to allow couples of the same sex to marry?&quot; before taking legislative action. Mullin&#8217;s motion was not sustained and the proposed bill is now due for a <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/calendar/SC090324.pdf">third reading</a> [Senate calendar; PDF] on Tuesday, after which it is expected to pass in the Senate and be introduced to the House of Representatives. Earlier this month, Vermont <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/">Governor Jim Douglas</a> (R) [official profile] said that he <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/vermont/articles/2009/03/11/vt_gov_says_he_opposes_same_sex_marriage/">opposes</a> [AP report] legalizing same-sex marriage, but it is unclear whether he would veto the bill.<br /><br />The Vermont Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/vermont-legislature-considers-same-sex.php">began hearings</a> [JURIST report] on the bill last week. If the proposed legislation passes, Vermont would join <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=massachusetts+marriage">Massachusetts</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/connecticut-judge-signs-off-on-same-sex.php">Connecticut</a> [JURIST report] in extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. In California, the state Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/california-supreme-court-hears.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">Proposition 8</a> [JURIST news archive] earlier this month, and a ruling is expected by early May. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">passage</a> of Proposition 8 last November amended the California constitution to define marriage to be between a man and a woman, overturning a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] by the California Supreme Court which permitted the marriage of same-sex couple.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK <a href="http://www.jackstrawmp.org.uk/">Justice Secretary Jack Straw</a> [official website] Monday outlined draft <a href="http://news.parliament.uk/2009/03/rights-and-responsibilities-statement/">legislation</a> [materials] that would officially recognize certain &quot;rights and responsibilities&quot; for British citizens. The legislation described in a government <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/rights-responsibilities.pdf">green paper</a> [PDF text] prior to public consultations would formally declare a number of rights which already exist in the country including access to medical care, education, and housing, as well as certain rights for victims of crime. It would also set out responsibilities expected of citizens, including the duties to vote, pay taxes, obey laws, and serve on juries. Straw said that the bill would not create new causes of action for citizens who had been denied these rights, nor against those who failed to perform otherwise non-mandatory duties, but would instead serve as an official declaration of their importance to the operation of the country and government:<blockquote>Bills of rights all over the world have demonstrated great symbolic and cultural importance, in the face of threats and challenge to a country&#8217;s stability and system of values.<br /><br />From the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320, the later Bill of Rights and Scottish Claim of Right in 1689, the great Reform Acts of the 19th and early 20th centuries, through to more recent landmarks, such as the foundation of the National Health Service as part of the welfare state, our history illustrates the proud traditions of liberty on which our current framework of democratic rights and responsibilities is built.<br /><br />We are living through a period of change &#8211; technologically, demographically, economically, socially and culturally. At such times of change, constitutional protections for fundamental rights and freedoms and the articulation of responsibilities can offer security. A new constitutional instrument, reflecting the values that give rise to these rights and responsibilities, could act as an anchor for people in the UK. </blockquote> Some who oppose the bill have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7959471.stm">criticized it</a> [BBC report] for lacking substance because the rights will not be enforceable, while others have said it does too much to entrench large social entitlements. A revised draft of the bill is expected in 2010 after consultations are concluded.<br /><br />The bill has long been a goal of UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and in a <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/uk-justice-minister-says-written.php">2008 interview</a> [JURIST report], Straw said it was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/uk-government-launches-bill-of-rights.php">part of a process</a> [JURIST report] of &quot;moving towards a written constitution&quot; for the UK. The UK currently has no single overarching constitutional document or rights charter, although its working &quot;unwritten constitution&quot; includes a variety of fundamental documents such as the <a href="http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519">Magna Carta</a> [text]. The opposition Liberal Democrats have long pushed for a written constitution, but the idea has only recently gained support among Labour and <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/uk-tory-leader-proposes-us-style-bill.php">Conservative</a> [JURIST report] party leaders. A British Bill of Rights would supplement but not replace the 1998 <a href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/19980042.htm">Human Rights Act</a> [text] implementing for the UK the European Convention on Human Rights.

United States</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-hears-plea-agreement-rico.php">report</a>] that a defendant&#39;s claim that the prosecution breached a plea agreement must be raised at trial in order to be reviewable on appeal, according to the plain-error standard under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/Rule52.htm">Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a> [Rule 52(b) text]. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority:<blockquote>Application of plain-error review in the present context is consistent with our cases, serves worthy purposes, has meaningful effects, and is in any event compelled by the Federal Rules. While we recognize that the Government&#39;s breach of a plea agreement is a serious matter, &quot;the seriousness of the error claimed does not remove consideration of it from the ambit of the Federal Rules of Criminal Pro-cedure.&quot;</blockquote>Justice David Souter filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice John Paul Stevens joined. Souter argued:<blockquote>Puckett is entitled to relief because he and every other defendant who may make an agreement with the Government are entitled to take the Government at its word. Puckett insists that the Government keep its word, and if we are going to have a plain-error doctrine at all, the Judiciary has no excuse for closing this generally available avenue of redress to Puckett or to any other criminal defendant standing in his shoes.</blockquote>The ruling affirms a <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/06/06-10543-CR0.wpd.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and resolves a split among the circuits.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Honduran <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1225416.stm#leaders">President Manuel Zelaya</a> [BBC profile] announced Monday that the government will <a href="http://latribuna.hn/news/49/ARTICLE/59832/2009-03-24.html">conduct a poll</a> [decree, in Spanish] to determine whether voters are receptive to a November referendum that would establish a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution. Zelaya&#39;s proposed constitutional referendum has created wide controversy, even among members of his own <a href="http://www.partidoliberal.net/">Liberal Party of Honduras</a> (PLH) [party website]. Zelaya&#39;s term ends in 2010, and it is suspected that the proposed changes will include extending presidential term limits. President of Congress Roberto Micheletti, who is also from the PLH, has accused Zelaya with treason to the <a href="http://www.honduras.net/honduras_constitution2.html">Constitution of Honduras</a> [text, in Spanish] and has pointed out that article 374 expressly prohibits reform by referendum or plebescite to article 384 governing the structure of government, national territory, and presidential terms. Zelaya&#39;s announcement came after meeting with the Council of Ministers, which has approved the decree for Zelaya&#39;s referendum poll. The <a href="http://www.ine-hn.org/">National Institute of Statistics</a> (INE) will conduct the poll by the last Sunday in June, asking whether voters want the question on the November ballot. Zelaya has said that he <a href="http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml;jsessionid=YASN1ZOJR3V5UCWIAA4SFFQKZAADWIWC?chid=3&schid=181&secid=192&cid=1883621&pagenum=1">has the support</a> [UNIVISION report, in Spanish] of the armed forces and many of the mayors across the country. The chief of the armed forces Romeo Vasquez Velasquez has said that the armed forces are <a href="http://www.hondudiario.com/politica=0979.php">willing to provide security</a> [<em>Hondudiario</em> report, in Spanish] for the 10,000 polling boxes to carry out Zelaya&#39;s decree, pending analysis of the legality of such an action.<br /><br />Under Zelaya&#39;s leadership, Honduras has joined Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua in the <a href="http://www.bolivariancentre.com/leftframe/alba.htm">Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas</a> (ALBA) [RIE bacgrounder] trade bloc, which was founded by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. In recent years, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/venezuela-voters-approve-amendment.php">Chavez in Venezuela</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/new-ecuador-constitution-approved-in.php">Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa</a> [JURIST report] have succeeded in passing constitutional reforms extending presidential terms and enhancing presidential powers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a>  [official website] <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/DASSKPressReleaseandOpinion.pdf">said</a> [press release and opinion, PDF] that the detention of Nobel Prize winner <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>] violates Myanmar&#39;s 1975 <a href="http://burmalibrary.org/docs/anti-subversion%20law.htm">State Protection Law</a> [text] and pressed for her immediate release in an opinion made public Monday. A panel, composed of Judges from Chile, Pakistan, Russia, Senegal, and Spain, issued a legal opinion in November arguing that Suu Kyi&#39;s detention since 2003 violates Myanmar&#39;s own laws because the law only permits detention for up to five years and only for state security reasons. The report says that her period of detention expired in May 2008 and that she does not pose a threat to Myanmar&#39;s security. Monday&#39;s report marks the first time that the UN had said that Myanmar was violating its own laws in detaining Suu Kyi. Four previous legal opinions have said that Myanmar&#39;s detention of Suu Kyi was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/myanmar-detention-of-democracy-advocate.php">illegal under UN law</a> [JURIST report] and have also called for her release.<br /><br />Last year, Myanmar officials defended the continued detention of Suu Kyi, saying that the 1975 law permits the government to detain Suu Kyi for up to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/myanmar-state-media-defends-suu-kyi.php">six years</a> [JURIST report] and pointed out that other countries like the US and the UK had similar anti-terror laws. Myanmar released 15 members of Suu Kyi&#39;s party, the National League for Democracy, last year but has so far <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/myanmar-junta-releases-political.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to release her for security reasons, despite earlier indications that it might do so.

Denedo</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-takes-deportation-cases.php">report</a>], in which the Court will consider whether a military appellate court has jurisdiction to entertain a petition for a <a href="http://definitions.uslegal.com/w/writ-of-coram-nobis/">writ of error <font style="font-style: italic;">coram nobis</font></a> [backgrounder] filed by a former service member to review a final court-martial conviction. The case involves a Nigerian national who enlisted in the US Navy and was later convicted on larceny charges. After he was discharged from the Navy, deportation proceedings began on the basis of the conviction. Denedo sought a writ of error <font style="font-style: italic;">coram nobis</font> from the <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces</a> (CAAF) [official website], which <a href="http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2008Term/07-8012.pdf">found</a> [opinion, PDF] that it had jurisdiction over the case. Appealing the ruling, the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] argued that the CAAF did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition because Denedo was a civilian at the time of its filing, and that Congress had not granted this kind of military court the ability to hear such writs after a petitioner leaves the military. Counsel for Denedo argued that the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1651.html">All Writs Act</a> (28 USC &sect; 1651 text) conferred jurisdiction for the courts to hear the writs just as the act did for non-military courts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] held a hearing Tuesday to investigate <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3739">&quot;abusive credit card practices and bankruptcy&quot;</a> [hearing materials]. The hearing, chaired by <a href="http://whitehouse.senate.gov/">Senator Sheldon Whitehouse</a> (D-RI) [official website], was held in conjunction with the proposed <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:s257is.txt.pdf">Consumer Credit Fairness Act</a> (CCFA) [S. 257 text, PDF], which would disallow bankruptcy claims for consumer credit card debt bearing high interest rates. The Senate committee heard testimony from individuals affected by high credit card interest rates, as well as from experts including law professors <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3739&wit_id=7745">Adam Levitin</a> and <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3739&wit_id=7744">Mark Scarberry</a> and researcher <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3739&wit_id=7741">David John</a> [testimonies, text]. In his opening remarks, Whitehouse said:<blockquote>I have introduced legislation that would give consumers leverage to negotiate for reasonable rates with their lenders and ban abusive lenders from using the bankruptcy court system to enforce their claims. Under the Consumer Credit Fairness Act, or CCFA, claims in bankruptcy stemming from consumer credit agreements carrying interest above a variable threshold &#8211; currently 18.5% &#8211; would be disallowed. With the leverage of a bankruptcy threat, a customer struggling under a 30% penalty rate could negotiate for more reasonable terms. In addition, bankruptcy filers with debts carrying effective interest rates above the threshold would be exempt from the so-called means test, a tactic that was enacted in the bank-written 2005 reforms to make it more difficult to enter bankruptcy. In practice, the means test delays relief in bankruptcy, keeping consumers in the &quot;sweat box&quot; of credit card debt.</blockquote>The increased use of consumer credit cards has lead to an increased number of bankruptcy filings in the US. In April 2008, a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-class.php">reinstated a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against a group of banks who required credit cardholders to use arbitration to settle disputes. Bankruptcy petitioners who have incurred consumer debt, including credit card debt, have faced increased barriers when attempting to discharge that debt due to the <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/tough-new-us-consumer-bankruptcy-law.php">2005 enactment</a> [JURIST report] of the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ008.109.pdf">Bankruptcy Abuse and Consumer Protection Act of 2005</a> [text, PDF]. The law was prompted by concerns that an increase in personal bankruptcies was adversely affecting retail stores, banks, and credit card companies that had to pick up the tab after consumers became insolvent. The changes make it harder for debtors to cast aside credit card and other debt by filing under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sup_01_11_10_7.html">Chapter 7</a> [text], the most common type of personal bankruptcy, which currently allows consumers to wipe out most of their unsecured debts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a>&nbsp;[official website] Monday&nbsp;<a href="/pdf/ruizdiazjudgment.pdf">ordered</a> [order, PDF] the revision of a US government <a href="http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/janqtr/pdf/8cfr245.2.pdf">regulation</a>&nbsp;[8 CFR &sect; 245.2(a)(2)(i)(B) text] that singles out religious workers applying for permanent residency. Judge Robert Lasnik issued the order in a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ghp-law.net/Cases.html">class action lawsuit</a> [case materials] brought by workers who argued that waiting for the approval of an employer petition, a requirement for religious workers only, frequently resulted in the expiration of their temporary visas before they could apply for permanent residency.&nbsp;The government had argued that the rule was justified by a historically high rate of fraud by religious workers, but Lasnik held that imposing the requirement was beyond the attorney general&#39;s authority, under which the regulations are made:<blockquote>The Attorney General does not have discretion to choose who is eligible to apply for adjustment of status (that determination having been made by Congress), to interpret the same statutory provision in different ways depending on the classification of the applicant, or to waive a statutory requirement.  Defendants may not, therefore, reject or refuse to accept plaintiffs&#8217; applications for adjustment of status based on the regulation barring religious workers from concurrent filing.</blockquote>The immigration enforcement tactics of the Bush administration have long been&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/bush-immigration-enforcement-policies.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] for being overly-aggressive and ineffective, and in&nbsp;February, US Secretary of Homeland Security&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1232568253959.shtm">Janet Napolitano</a>&nbsp;[official profile]&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-secretary-of-homeland-security-calls.php">called for a review</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] of an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ice.gov/">Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>&nbsp;(ICE) [official website] workplace immigration raid that resulted in the arrest of 28 workers. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] has said he remains <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29764989/">committed to &quot;comprehensive immigration reform,&quot;</a> [AP report] even though the issue has not been prominent early in his term.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] submitted a &quot;Proposal for Endangerment Finding for Greenhouse Gases Under the Clean Air Act&quot; to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/inforeg/">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</a> (OIRA) [official website] of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/">Office of Management and Budget</a> (OMB) [official website], setting the stage for the first ever federal regulation of greenhouse gases. The proposal, which was submitted Friday and has not been made public, is expected to lead to a decision by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases under the federal <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [text, PDF]. Submission of an agency rule to OIRA for review is typically the final step in the federal administrative rulemaking process, and can be an indication that a rule is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/science/earth/24epa.html?_r=1&ref=us">nearing public announcement</a> [NYT report]. Environmental interest and advocacy groups called the EPA proposal <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/23/AR2009032301068.html?hpid=moreheadlines">groundbreaking and historic</a> [<em>Washington Post</em> report].<br /><br />The regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act has been the subject of considerable controversy and litigation in recent years. Earlier this month, the EPA held a <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/epa-reconsiders-california-request-to.php">hearing</a> [JURIST report] to reconsider California&#39;s request to regulate automobile greenhouse gases. The request had been denied by the EPA during the administration of former president George W. Bush. In July, a US House of Representatives report revealed that the Bush administration abandoned plans to use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases on power plants and other stationary pollution sources <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/oil-lobbyists-convinced-white-house-to.php">after opposition from the oil industry</a> [JURIST report]. In April 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that the EPA <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/supreme-court-endorses-epa-authority-to.php">had the authority</a> [JURIST report] under the Clean Air Act to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by automobiles.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] heard <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/daycall/daycall_03-24-09.pdf">oral arguments</a> [day call, PDF; <a href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/march09.shtml">briefs</a>]  Tuesday in <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF], in which the Court will consider whether federal election law prohibits a corporation from funding a documentary on a candidate in advance of a federal election. Petitioner <a href="http://www.citizensunited.org/">Citizens United</a> [advocacy website] is a non-profit conservative advocacy corporation that produced a 90-minute documentary, &quot;Hillary: The Movie,&quot; questioning then-Senator Hillary Clinton&#39;s (D-NY) qualifications to serve as US president. Citizens United sought an order declaring that ads for the movie, scheduled to air during the Democratic presidential primary, were not &quot;electioneering communications&quot; within the meaning of Section 203 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/background/campaign_finance/bcra_txt.pdf">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> (BCRA) [text, PDF]. The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] initially <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv2240-39">refused</a> to issue the order, and later <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2007cv2240-65">determined</a> [opinions, PDF] in a judgment on the merits that the ads were covered by Section 203, allowing the <a href="http://www.fec.gov">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) [official website] to regulate and subject them to disclosure requirements. Appealing the decision, Citizens United challenged the application of BCRA on broad First Amendment grounds:<blockquote>The government cannot prove and has not attempted to prove that a 90-minute documentary made available to people who choose affirmatively to receive it, to opt in, by an ideologically oriented small corporation poses any threat of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance. Indeed, this documentary is the very definition of robust, uninhibited debate about a subject of intense political interest that the First Amendment is there to guarantee.</blockquote>The government argued the Court&#39;s decisions in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/02-1674P.ZO">McConnell v. Federal Election Commission</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/pdf/06-969P.ZO">Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life</a> [opinions, PDF] allowed them to regulate the video because it was funded by a corporation and could not reasonably be interpreted as anything other than an appeal to vote against Clinton.

Mirzayance</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/supreme-court-hears-right-to-counsel.php">report</a>] that a lawyer&#8217;s recommendation that a criminal defendant withdraw an insanity plea does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel for purposes of a federal <em>habeas</em> claim. Writing for the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas reasoned:<blockquote>The law does not require counsel to raise every available nonfrivolous defense. ... Counsel also is not required to have a tactical reason - above and beyond a reasonable appraisal of a claim&#8217;s dismal prospects for success - for recommending that a weak claim be dropped altogether. Mirzayance has thus failed to demonstrate that his counsel&#39;s performance was deficient.<br /><br />In addition, Mirzayance has not demonstrated that he suffered prejudice from his counsel&#39;s performance.</blockquote>Justices Antonin Scalia, David Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined in the opinion as to all except Part II, which held that the California Court of Appeals&#39; decision to deny the ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not violate federal law under <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2254.html">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a> (AEDPA) [28 USC &sect;2254(d)(1) text]. The decision overturns a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/07-1315_ob.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] At least 2,390 people were executed throughout 25 countries in 2008, according to a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/003/2009/en/0b789cb1-baa8-4c1b-bc35-58b606309836/act500032009en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF; AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/death-penalty-2390-executions-2008-worldwide-72-cent-china-20090324">press release</a>] released Tuesday by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], up from the <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/001/2008/en/b43a1e5b-ffea-11dc-b092-bdb020617d3d/act500012008eng.pdf">reported 1,252 executions in 2007</a> [AI report, PDF]. China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the US account for 93 percent of all executions performed in 2008. China alone had 1,718 executions, or 72 percent of executions worldwide, amidst questions regarding fairness of trials and access to lawyers for the accused. AI also reported that there is a global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty. Two-thirds of all nations have abolished capital punishment. In the Americas, the US is the only country that carries out regular executions. Last year, the US performed the smallest number of executions since 1995 with one state, Texas, accounting for half of those executions.<br /><br />The report by AI follows a second <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/IOR52/001/2009/en/44676e0e-0396-4693-b721-f1453b5245e4/ior520012009en.html">resolution</a> [text] by the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] calling on member states to observe a moratorium on capital punishment. Additionally, the <a href="http://www.achpr.org/">African Commission on Human and Peoples&#39; Rights</a> [advocacy website] passed a similar <a href="http://www.achpr.org/english/resolutions/resolution136_en.htm">resolution</a> [text] in November calling for the observation of a death penalty moratorium. In contrast, executions resumed in the US in April 2008 after the US Supreme Court lifted an <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/us-sees-first-month-without-any.php">effective moratorium</a> by <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-upholds-kentucky-lethal.php">upholding lethal injection</a> [JURIST reports]. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/georgia-conducts-first-execution-since.php">first execution following the ruling</a> [JURIST report] was conducted in Georgia in May 2008. However, individual states such as <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico</a> [JURIST reports] have abolished the death penalty.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The corruption trial of former Taiwanese president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2172980.stm">Chen Shui-bian</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=chen+shui+bian">news archive</a>] opened Thursday, one day after Chen criticized the proceedings as &quot;political persecution.&quot; Chen was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/former-taiwan-president-indicted-on.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in December and faces possible life in prison on charges of embezzlement, receiving bribes, forgery, and money laundering. Chen has maintained that the charges against him are politically motivated, alleging that the administration of current President <a href="http://www.president.gov.tw/en/">Ma Ying-jeou</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=Ma+Ying-jeou">news archive</a>] is using the trial to distance itself from Chen&#39;s anti-China views. On Wednesday, Chen <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2009/03/26/2003439428">issued a statement of protest</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Taipei Times</span> report], declaring that a verdict against him had been determined before the trial began. Also Wednesday, the Taiwanese <a href="http://www.moj.gov.tw/mp095.html">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] announced that it will <a href="http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=903934&lang=eng_news">investigate statements made by a prosecutor</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Taiwan News</span> report] in the Chen trial on a television talk show to determine whether any confidential information was revealed. Chen&#39;s trial is expected to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/world/asia/27taiwan.html">conclude in mid-April</a> [NYT report].  <br /><br />Chen has staged two <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/detained-taiwan-ex-president-chen-again.php">hunger strikes</a> [JURIST report] in protest of the charges against him, and in January he <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/taiwan-high-court-rejects-appeal-for.php">unsuccessfully appealed</a> [JURIST report] his pretrial detention. In February, Chen&#39;s wife, Wu Shu-Chen, pleaded guilty to <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/taiwan-first-lady-indicted-on.php">charges</a> [JURIST report] of money-laundering and forgery, but denied charges that she embezzled from the presidential state affairs fund. Chen&#39;s sister-in-law has also <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/taiwan-ex-presidents-associates-plead.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges that she had forged documents and transferred money to bank accounts upon orders from Chen and Wu. Chen has asserted that he was unaware of Wu&#39;s actions. In September 2008, Chen was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/former-taiwan-president-cleared-on.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] of separate defamation charges.

Deputy Prime Minister <a href="http://www.alexandrvondra.cz/">Alexandr Vondra</a> [official website] said Wednesday that the recent collapse of the country&#39;s ruling coalition would likely &quot;complicate&quot; its ratification of the treaty. The coalition had been led by Topolanek, but the government on Tuesday <a href="http://www.praguepost.com/news/865-no-confidence-vote-topples-govt.html">lost a no-confidence vote</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Prague Post</span> report] in the country&#39;s parliament, leading to his Thursday <a href="http://www.radio.cz/en/news/84095#1">resignation</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Czech Radio</span> report]. There has also been speculation that the failure could <a href="http://praguemonitor.com/2009/03/26/czech-eu-presidency-coma-after-governments-fall">cause other problems</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Prague Monitor</span> report] for the EU given the Czech Republic&#39;s <a href="http://www.eu2009.cz/en/">presidency</a> [EU presidency website] of the Union, but Topolanek said he doesn&#39;t expect the power change to affect the country&#39;s participation in the role. The <a href="http://www.senat.cz/index-eng.php">Czech Senate</a> [official website] had been expected to vote on the treaty next month, but it is not clear whether that timeline will now be met.<br /><br />The Czech Republic&#39;s <a href="http://www.psp.cz/cgi-bin/eng/sqw/hp.sqw">Chamber of Deputies</a> [official website], or lower house of parliament, in February&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eu2009.cz/en/news-and-documents/news/statement-of-deputy-prime-minister-a--vondra-on-the-chamber-of-deputies_-consent-with-the-lisbon-treaty-ratification-10076/">approved</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/czech-lower-house-approves-eu-reform.php">report</a>] the Lisbon Treaty, but both the senate and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.klaus.cz/klaus2/asp/default.asp?lang=EN&CatID=YJrRHRsP">President Vaclav Klaus</a> [official website] must also approve the treaty for it to be adopted. Beyond challenges in the Czech Republic, the treaty still must pass a&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/12/ireland-agrees-to-hold-second.php">referendum in Ireland</a> where voters had earlier&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2008/06/ireland-voters-reject-eu-reform-treaty.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] the treaty in a June 2008 referendum, prompting <a href="http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=437">Polish President Lech Kaczynski</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/poland-president-refuses-to-sign-eu.php">refuse</a> [JURIST report] to sign, calling it &quot;pointless.&quot; In November, Sweden <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/sweden-parliament-approves-treaty-of.php">became the 24th EU state to ratify the charter</a> [JURIST report]. In 2005, a proposed <a href="/currentawareness/euconstitution.php">European constitution</a> [JURIST news archive] failed when voters in <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/breaking-news-exit-polls-say-france.php">France</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/breaking-news-exit-poll-says-dutch.php">Netherlands</a> [JURIST reports] rejected the proposal in national referenda.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/index.html">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) [official website] has named several key officials and finalized procedural and evidentiary rules in order to begin investigating and trying those involved in the February 2005 assassination of <a href="/currentawareness/hariri.php">former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri</a> [JURIST news archive], according to a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=30286&Cr=lebanon&Cr1=tribunal">statement</a> [UN News Centre report] issued by the court Wednesday. The STL, which was <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/lebanon-panel-nominating-judges-for.php">created</a> [JURIST report] in May 2007, will be headed by Antonio Cassese, who was the first president of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] appointed Francois Roux of France as the head of the defense office. <a href="http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2007/11/canadian_prosec.php">Daniel Bellemare</a> [<em>Ya Libnan</em> profile], who formerly headed the <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8353.doc.htm">International Independent Investigation Commission</a> (IIIC) [authorizing resolution; UN <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocusRel.asp?infocusID=110&Body=Leban&Body1=">materials</a>] that assisted Lebanese authorities with the investigation of Hariri&#39;s assassination, was appointed as lead prosecutor of the STL earlier this month. While the court has named Cassese and pre-trial judge Daniel Fransen of Belgium, it said that it will refrain from naming the remaining judges for the trial and appeals chamber until the appropriate security precautions are in place. <br /><br />Last month, the STL&#39;s registrar <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/avl/pdf/ls/Vincent_bio.pdf">Robin Vincent</a> [official profile, PDF] said that it plans to ask the Lebanese government to <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=1&article_id=99597">transfer four generals</a> [<em>Daily Star</em> report; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/un-hariri-tribunal-to-begin-work-march.php">report</a>] being held on suspicion of involvement in Hariri&#39;s assassination to the court&#39;s custody. In March 2008, Bellemare said he believed a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-commission-suspects-criminal-network.php">criminal network was behind the assassination</a> [JURIST report]. The STL will consist of 11 international and Lebanese judges and have a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/un-secures-first-year-funding-for.php">budget of $51 million</a> [JURIST report] for its first year . The investigation into the assassination, which had been <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/hariri-prosecutor-asks-security-council.php">extended</a> past its original anticipated end date and <a href="/paperchase/2007/06/un-hariri-probe-to-examine-killing-of.php">expanded</a> to cover other assassinations in the country, has increased existing tensions between Lebanon and Syria as several IIIC reports have <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-hariri-investigator-asks-security.php">implicated Syrian officials</a> in Hariri&#39;s death [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.aopc.org/T/SupremeCourt/">Supreme Court of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/OpPosting/Supreme/out/81mm2008pco3.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] hundreds of juvenile convictions to be overturned and records to be expunged without hearing pursuant to the <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/OpPosting/Supreme/out/JudgeGrimFirstInterimReport3-12-09.pdf">recommendation of a Special Master</a> [text, PDF], in an attempt to rectify &quot;the alleged travesty of juvenile justice&quot; committed by two state judges involved in an alleged kickback scheme. In February, <a href="http://www.luzernecountycourts.com/">Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas</a> [official website] President Judge Mark Ciavarella and former President Judge Michael Conahan <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/pennsylvania-judges-plead-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pam/press_releases/Information-Ciavarella_Conahan-1_26_09.pdf">federal corruption charges</a> [criminal information, PDF] that claimed that between June 2000 and January 2007 they accepted more than $2.6 million in kickbacks for sentencing teenagers to two private juvenile detention facilities in which they had a financial interest. Special Master Arthur Grim noted that Pennsylvania jurisprudence provides that &quot;the appearance of [judicial] impropriety is sufficient justification for the grant of new proceedings before another judge.&quot; The state Supreme Court accepted Grim&#39;s recommendation that consent decrees and adjudications should be vacated and records should be expunged for isolated, non-serious offenses where the juveniles appearing before Ciavarella were not represented by lawyers. Grim wrote: <blockquote>This prompt action in these non-serious cases will be at least one step towards righting the wrongs which were visited upon these juveniles and will help restore confidence in the justice system. Furthermore, it is not in the interest of the community to relitigate these non-serious cases, nor do I believe that the victims would be well-served by new proceedings.</blockquote> Each affected juvenile offender will be given an opportunity to object to the decision, and the Supreme Court will issue future findings on other, more serious classes of affected cases. A spokesperson for the Philadelphia-based <a href="http://www.jlc.org/">Juvenile Law Center</a> (JLC) [advocacy website], which filed the case, <a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/breaking/news_breaking/20090326_Court_overturns_hundreds_of_cases_in_court_scandal.html">welcomed</a> [<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> report] the court&#39;s decision.<br /><br />Ciavarella and Conahan were specifically accused of honest services fraud and tax fraud. A spokesperson for the JLC said that juveniles arraigned before Ciavarella between 2003 and 2006 received excessive sentences. Both judges agreed to 87-month prison sentences for themselves, but the pleas will not be formally accepted until sentencing, which could take up to 90 days. University of Pittsburgh School of Law Professor <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/faculty/profiles/harrisda">David Harris</a> [professional profile] <a href="/forumy/2009/02/sentencing-children-for-kickbacks.php">criticized the plea agreement</a> [JURIST op-ed], saying, &quot;I don&#8217;t think seven years is nearly enough for the harm they did to the system of justice, to our collective belief in the rule of law, to these children, and to their families.&quot; Yet to be determined are the amount the judges will be ordered to pay in restitution, and whether Ciavarella wrongly incarcerated juveniles to benefit the two companies involved. These issues will be <a href="http://www.scrantontimes.com/articles/2009/02/13/news/sc_times_trib.20090213.a.pg1.tt13pleamain_s1.2302288_top2.txt">resolved</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Scranton Times</span> report] during the presentence investigation and through a possible hearing before the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website]. The judges have also agreed to resign their positions and be disbarred. Families whose children were sentenced to the detention centers <a href="http://www.thetimes-tribune.com/articles/2009/02/13/news/doc499591c84f96d726930412.txt">filed a lawsuit</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Scranton Times</span> report] against the judges and 14 other defendants, including the company that ran the detention facilities and two individuals who allegedly paid the judges. The judges allegedly received the payments into businesses they owned and in some cases falsely characterized the payments as rental income from a Florida condominium.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Russian trials decided by juries are currently restricted, creating hopeless situations for those accused of crimes who choose not to plead guilty, according to former oil executive <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/khodorkovsky.php">JURIST news archive</a>] on Friday. In a <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/news-resources/stories/khodorkovsky-hopes-second-trial-complete-opposite-first">statement</a> [text] released on his defense website, Khodorkovsky, who is currently on trial for embezzlement, expressed his hope that this, his second trial, will turn out completely different from his first, writing: <blockquote>Today one who does not plead guilty, unless his case is tried by a jury court, is guaranteed to make his situation significantly worse because:<br /><br />- He will get a guilty verdict <br />- His jail term will be extended, AND<br />- There will be no hope for early release.<br /><br />I believe that people ready for such a sacrifice for the sake of the truth, deserve public attention.</blockquote>This statement comes just months after Russian <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/D_Medvedev.shtml">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile] signed into law amendments allowing trials for treason and terrorism to be <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/russia-president-approves-law-ending.php">adjudicated without juries</a> [JURIST report]. Khodorkovsky is <a href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090327/120769293.html">expected to play a stronger role</a> [RIA Novosti report] in his own defense in his upcoming trial. Khodorkovsky&#39;s trial, as well as that of his former business partner, Platon Lebedev, is due to begin March 31.<br /><br />Pre-trial arguments <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-khodorkovsky-trial-begins-in-moscow.php">began earlier this month</a> [JURIST report]. Critics have claimed that the charges against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are politically motivated due to Khodorkovsky&#39;s opposition of former Russian president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=putin">Vladimir Putin</a> [JURIST news archive]. The transfer of the two from prison to Moscow to stand trial on the new charges was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/khodorkovsky-to-face-new-trial-as.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] last month by a judge for the District Court in Moscow. Khodorkovsky still maintains that his <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/russian-oil-magnate-guilty-on-six.php">2005 conviction</a> [JURIST report] on the fraud and tax evasion was unjust, and maintains his innocence. He <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/former-yukos-oil-executive-applies-for.php">requested early release</a> from that sentence last July, but his application was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/russian-court-denies-early-release-for.php">rejected</a> [JURIST reports] in August because he disobeyed guards at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/25/russia.tomparfitt">Krasnokamensk penal colony</a> [Guardian backgrounder], refused to participate in a training program, and faced the possibility of additional charges. Khodorkovsky has <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/khodorkovsky-appeals-parole-rejection.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] that decision.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] passed a resolution Thursday calling for laws against defamation of religion, in preparation for next month&#39;s <a href="http://www.un.org/durbanreview2009/">Durban Review Conference</a> [official website] on racism, discrimination, and xenophobia. The vote was 23-13 in favor of the resolution. Ahead of Thursday&#39;s vote, a number of critics of international defamation of religion legislation <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE52O5QY20090325">urged the Human Rights Council to reject the resolution</a> [Reuters report], arguing that the concept has no validity under international law because only individuals, not concepts or beliefs, can be defamed. Several national delegates, including those from Muslim countries, called for passage of the resolution on Wednesday, saying that <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/4563EF29865414F3C1257584003C6501?opendocument">defamation of religion protection was needed</a> [UNHRC press release] due to rising Islamophobic incidents, persisting manifestations of racism and acts of intolerance including religious profiling.<br /><br />In December 2007, the UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/un-general-assembly-adopts-resolution.php">passed a resolution against defamation of religion</a> [JURIST report], expressing concern about laws that have led to religious discrimination and profiling since <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. Then-Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/pakistan-president-calls-for-ban-on.php">called for the resolution</a> [JURIST report] in the General Assembly in 2006, citing feelings in the Muslim world of &quot;desperation and injustice&quot; in the wake of the Danish <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cartoon+-tobacco">publication of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad</a> [JURIST news archive]. The UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/un-rights-council-passes-resolution.php">passed a similar resolution</a> [JURIST report] opposing defamation of Islam in March 2007, with many western nations and advocacy groups standing in opposition.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Tokyo District Court on Thursday <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090327a4.html">rejected a lawsuit</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Japan Times</span> report] filed by 172 teachers and school personnel who were punished for refusing to sing the national anthem and salute the flag at school events. The school staff argued that the punishments, ranging from suspensions and salary reductions to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/world/asia/27japan.html">&quot;special retraining&quot;</a> [NYT report], violated their freedom of thought guaranteed under the <a href="http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Japan/English/english-Constitution.html">Japanese constitution</a> [text]. The District Court has issued mixed rulings since <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20031024b2.html">new rules</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Japan Times</span> report]  were issued altering how the flag is to be flown and how the national anthem, &quot;Kimigayo,&quot; is to be sung, as well as mandating punishment for violations of the rules, with a number of those rulings currently under review by the Tokyo High Court.<br /><br />The controversial statute is just one of many examples of a resurgence of Japanese nationalism and desire for Japan to have a greater presence on the world stage. Over the past decade, Japan has made numerous attempts to <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=japan+constitution+amendment">amend its &quot;pacifist&quot; constitution</a> [JURIST news archive], particularly Article 9, which includes, &quot;the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.&quot; In January, Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada authorized the Japanese navy to <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/japan-orders-navy-to-combat-engage.php">engage pirates</a> [JURIST report] off of the coast of Somalia, in possible violation of the constitution. In May 2008, Japanese lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/japan-upper-house-approves-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] authorizing the use of the country&#39;s space program for defense purposes. In November 2007, The Sapporo District Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/japan-court-dismisses-suit-challenging.php">rejected a claim</a> [JURIST report] that the presence of Japanese troops in Iraq violated the constitution, and in January of that year, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/europe/pmv0701/nato.html">elevated the Defense Agency</a> [speech text] to the Ministry of Defense, a cabinet-level Ministry with an increased budget.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] FBI director <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/libref/executives/director.htm">Robert Mueller</a> [official profile] <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3721&wit_id=7757">told</a> [testimony] the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] Wednesday that the rise in financial fraud investigations is limiting the ability of the FBI to fight other crimes. Mueller, speaking during the &quot;Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Investigation&quot; <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=3721">hearing</a> [materials], told Congress that since 2003 public corruption cases have increased more than 58 percent. The effort to fight the drastic increase in cases has required additional resources from within the organization. Mueller said: <blockquote>These cases are straining the FBI&#39;s resources. Indeed, we have had to shift resources from other criminal programs to address the current financial crisis. In Fiscal Year 2007, we had 120 agents investigating mortgage fraud cases. In Fiscal Year 2008, that number increased to 180 agents, and currently over 250 agents are assigned to mortgage fraud and related cases.</blockquote>The number of cases is not expected to decline. In FY 2009 there have already been 28,873 mortgage fraud Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed, which is on pace to nearly double the total in FY 2008. Mueller also discussed new techniques that the FBI is using in order to be as efficient as possible in investigating such crimes. In additional to his comments on economic fraud, Mueller discussed the organization&#39;s transformation in recent years, and the organization&#39;s effort in preventing violent crimes and terrorism.<br /><br />As public scrutiny remains high for the entire financial industry, it is not surprising that the government continues to respond with increased measures of prevention. Last month, the FBI <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/fbi-shifting-focus-from.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it was looking at shifting a number of agents from national security and counter terrorism activities to investigations involving financial fraud. Other government agencies are also feeling the urgency to respond to the continued alleges of fraud. Last month, the <a href="http://sec.gov/index.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-chairman-names-new-director-of.php">appointed</a> [JURIST report] a new director of enforcement, as the organization deals with the fallout from disgraced Wall Street investor <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive].

Scotland said she determined the investigation was necessary after reviewing <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/guantanamo-ex-detainee-claims-memos.php">allegations</a> [JURIST report] that an MI5 agent gave US CIA agents questions that were asked of Mohammed during his alleged torture in Morocco.&nbsp;Mohamed, a native of Ethiopia who claims to have been transferred to Morocco for torture under a US program of&nbsp;<a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=extraordinary+rendition">extraordinary rendition</a>&nbsp;[JURIST news archive], said he obtained the documents through the US legal process while seeking his release from Guantanamo Bay.<div><br />Earlier this month, the UK government&#39;s independent reviewer of terror laws <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/uk-anti-terrorism-reviewer-urges.php">called for a judicial inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into British complicity in US rendition and torture. British media reported last week that UN special rapporteur on torture Manfred Nowak told British ministers that <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-torture-investigator-warns-uk-over.php">MI5 may have been complicit</a> [JURIST report] in torture committed while detainees including Mohamed were in US custody. Mohamed <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/former-guantanamo-detainee-binyam.php"> was returned to the UK</a> [JURIST report] last week following seven years of detention, including five at Guantanamo Bay, where he was held on charges of conspiring to commit terrorism. Those charges were <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/pentagon-dismisses-charges-against-5.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in October, but Mohamed remained in custody while US authorities considered filing new charges.<br /></div>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/default.htm">New Hampshire House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted Thursday to approve a <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2009/HB0436.html">bill</a> [HB 436 text] that would permit <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. The bill passed by a vote of 186-179, and now moves on to the New Hampshire <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/senate/">State Senate</a> [official website]. If approved by the Senate and signed into law by New Hampshire <a href="http://www.governor.nh.gov/index.htm">Governor John Lynch</a> (D) [official website], the bill would &quot;eliminate[] the exclusion of same gender couples from marriage, affirm[] religious freedom protections of clergy with regard to the solemnization of marriage, and provide[] a mechanism by which same gender couples who have entered into a civil union prior to the enactment of this bill may obtain the legal status of marriage.&quot; The New Hampshire House vote was <a href="http://unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=NH+House+endorses+gay+marriage&articleId=d2564bb9-7761-401a-9366-f3dccde337a5">met with derision</a> [<em>New Hampshire Union-Leader</em> report] from New Hampshire Republican Party chairman John Sununu. Lynch has opposed same-sex marriage in the state, saying that the New Hampshire <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/new-hampshire-governor-signs-civil.php">civil union law</a> [JURIST report] passed in 2007 provides the same legal protections for same-sex couples.<br /><br />The New Hampshire attorney general was one of ten state attorneys general to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/ags-from-10-states-seek-stay-of.php">petition the Supreme Court of California</a> to postpone implementation of its <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/california-high-court-rules-same-sex.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] to allow same-sex marriages in that state. The New Hampshire same-sex civil union law, which <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/new-hampshire-same-sex-civil-unions-law.php">took effect in 2008</a> [JURIST report], allows same-sex couples to enter into civil unions with the &quot;same rights, responsibilities, and obligations as married couples.&quot; In 2005, a New Hampshire Senate commission on same-sex marriages <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/new-hampshire-commission-rejects-same.php">voted to recommend</a> [JURIST report] that the state not allow same-sex couples to marry, not recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages, and not establish a domestic partner registry.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] on Friday passed a resolution <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/A7F429D58E34CAD9C125758600444034?OpenDocument">condemning Myanmar for human rights violations</a> [press release] and calling on the military junta to desist from politically motivated arrests and release nearly 2,100 political prisoners, which include Nobel Laureate <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1950505.stm">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Aung+San+Suu+Kyi">news archive</a>]. The resolution was condemned by countries in Asia and Russia as ineffective and unnecessary due to improved conditions for human rights. Under the resolution, the council reappointed Special Rapporteur Tomas Ojea Quintana for one year to continue monitoring the human rights situation in the country.<br /><br />Last week, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/index.htm">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.freedom-now.org/documents/DASSKPressReleaseandOpinion.pdf">said</a> [press release and opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-body-claims-myanmar-violating.php">report</a>] that the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi violates Myanmar&#39;s 1975 <a href="http://burmalibrary.org/docs/anti-subversion%20law.htm">State Protection Law</a> [text] and pressed for her immediate release. In February, the military government of Myanmar granted amnesty to 23 political detainees and more than 6,300 other prisoners, said Thailand-based human rights group <a href="http://www.aappb.org/">Assistance Association for Political Prisoners</a> (AAPP) [advocacy website]. These grants were in response to increasing international pressure on the military junta to end its persecution of political dissidents. In January, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] sent an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA01/001/2009/en/6624a023-ee30-11dd-99b6-630c5239b672/asa010012009en.pdf">open letter</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-urges-myanmar-to-end.php">report</a>] to the government, urging it to cease targeting its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4793924.stm">Rohingya Muslim minority</a> [BBC profile]. In December, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ga10804.doc.htm">adopted a resolution</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-passes-resolution.php">report</a>] denouncing the nation&#39;s alleged human rights violations. In June, the UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/unhrc-condemns-myanmar-human-rights.php">criticized the government of Myanmar</a> [JURIST report] for its continued human rights abuses and refusal to cooperate with humanitarian groups.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Treasury Secretary <a href="http://treasury.gov/organization/bios/geithner-e.shtml">Timothy Geithner</a> [official profile] said that the US <a href="http://treasury.gov/">Department of the Treasury</a> [official website] will <a href="http://treasury.gov/press/releases/tg68.htm">propose stronger rules</a> [prepared remarks; <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/18925/">transcript</a>] in response to the current economic crisis, at a meeting with the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/index.html">Council on Foreign Relations</a> (CFR) [advocacy website] Wednesday. Geithner also said that the US should push for global financial reforms when he accompanies US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] to the <a href="http://www.g20.org/">G-20</a> [official website] meeting next week. Geithner said:<blockquote>In the coming weeks, we will take additional steps, among them, proposing new and stronger rules to protect American consumers and investors against financial fraud and abuse. These will help us deal in the future with threats like the practices in subprime lending that kicked off the current crisis. And because we have learned that risk respects no borders, our plan will not focus solely on financial regulations in the United States, but - with the help of other interested nations and strengthened international bodies - on stronger standards globally, as well.</blockquote>Fielding questions from the Council, Geithner said the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website] governor&#39;s <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/sdr.htm">plan</a> [IMF factsheet] to &quot;increase the use of the IMF&#39;s special drawing rights&quot; deserves to be considered, and should not be thought of as a motion towards a global monetary union, but rather as building on current structure. Geithner also said that global response to the current financial crisis is already different from and motivated by the lessons of prior experiences.<br /><br />Geithner has emphasized <a href="http://treasury.gov/press/releases/tg15.htm">increased restrictions on financial institutions</a> [press release, JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/obama-restricts-executive-compensation.php">report</a>] receiving government assistance. Geithner advocates expanding the powers of the chief financial regulating entities such as the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Last month, a group of lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/international-finance-court-should-be.php">called for the formation of an International Finance Court</a> [JURIST report] to adjudicate the issues around the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] fraud case, and they will also seek to present their proposal at next week&#39;s G-20 meeting.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll153.xml">285-140</a> [roll call vote] Wednesday to approve the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.00146:">Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009</a> [HR 146 materials], a collection of more than 160 bills aimed at preserving federal land as wilderness areas, limiting gas and oil development, establishing the National Landscape Conservation System, and various water protection efforts. Among other initiatives, the measure would designate <a href="http://www.leaveitwild.org/docs/Omnibus_Wilderness_Designations_03-2009.pdf">2 million acres</a> [map, PDF] of federal land as protected wilderness areas, significantly adding to the <a href="http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm">National Wilderness Preservation System</a> [website]. A spokesman for <a href="http://www.leaveitwild.org">Campaign for America&#39;s Wilderness</a> [advocacy group] <a href="http://www.leaveitwild.org/news/releases/1603">applauded the legislation</a> [press release] as being &quot;crafted to both protect our nation&#39;s public lands and help sustain local economies.&quot; The <a href="http://wilderness.org">Wilderness Society</a> [advocacy website] expressed their <a href="http://wilderness.org/content/pr-omni-nlcs-20090325">approval</a> [press release] of the establishment of The National Landscape Conservation System, touting it as the first new land conservation system in a decade. <a href="http://www.friendsoftheclearwater.org">Friends of the Clearwater</a> [advocacy group] have <a href="http://www.friendsoftheclearwater.org/articles/comment-against-omnibus-public-land-management-act-2009">spoken out against</a> [text] a previous version of the legislation, criticizing its public land exchange provisions and constrains on land use as being against the public interest. The measure, which was approved by the US Senate last week, now awaits approval from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile], who is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/science/earth/26land.html?ref=us">expected to sign</a> [NYT report]. <br /><br />The legislation would affect some of the same land at the center of the controversy surrounding the <a href="http://roadless.fs.fed.us/">Roadless Area Conservation Rule</a> [Forest Service backgrounder], implemented by former president Bill Clinton in 2001 and <a href="/paperchase/2005/05/new-rule-allows-road-construction-on.php">replaced</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 by the Bush administration with a rule allowing governors to request that regulations on the management of roadless areas be developed to meet the needs of individual states. The Clinton-era rule would have prohibited mining, logging, and road construction in the forests of 38 states and Puerto Rico, totaling more than 58 million acres of land. In December, a federal judge <a href="/pdf/roadlessorder.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/federal-judge-limits-2006-ruling.php">report</a>] that her 2006 <a href="http://www.earthjustice.org/library/legal_docs/opinion-9-20-06_roadless.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/federal-judge-reinstates-ban-against.php">report</a>] invalidating the Bush administration <a href="http://roadless.fs.fed.us/documents/m-05/fr-05132005-state-petition.html?WAISdocID=989013494036+121+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve">rule</a> [text] applies only to 10 western states. In August, another federal judge <a href="/pdf/roadlessrulingaugust.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the Clinton-era rule was invalid, and the Bush administration had asked that the two conflicting decisions be reconciled. Cases are currently pending in federal courts in San Francisco and Denver, and the Obama administration could also make changes to the rule.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) [official website] on Thursday&nbsp;said that it has focused on the effects of counter-terrorism efforts and global warming on human rights, as well as effective conflict resolution and the support of international institutions charged with protecting the rights in its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf15/human-rights-2008">Annual Report on Human Rights</a>&nbsp;[text, PDF]. Introducing the report, UK Foreign Secretary <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/how-we-are-organised/ministers/d-miliband">David Miliband</a> [official profile] said the office had made an effort to <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/newsroom/latest-news/?view=Speech&id=15446824">convey objectively</a> [statement text] both its successes and challenges in advancing human rights around the world:<blockquote>The British people&#8217;s commitment to human rights is born from a sense of our history, of rights forged out of shared struggles, and on the belief that free societies offer the best prospects for long term stability and growth. Economic freedom is the best way to empower individuals to fight poverty and improve their own standard of living. Political freedom &#8211; and in particular effective democracy&#8211;is the best guarantee against political corruption and mismanagement. And as Kofi Annan said, &#8220;Humanity will not enjoy security without development, it will not enjoy development without security, and it will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.&#8221;<br /><br />The Human Rights report is a clear and comprehensive survey of our own efforts; an honest account of the successes, the setbacks and the dilemmas.</blockquote> The FCO also focused on the 20 countries where it said the human rights situations were most concerning. Among these, it said there was particular danger to civilians in <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=zimbabwe+violence">Zimbabwe</a>, the <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=drc">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, and <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=israel+military">Israel and the Palestinian Territory</a> [JURIST news archives]. It said that the humanitarian situations in <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=sudan+aid">Sudan</a> and <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=myanmar">Myanmar</a> [JURIST news archives] had become more dire. The FCO also criticized China for its <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=tibet">treatment of Tibetans</a>, and warned that Russia, in addition to its <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=ossetia">conflict with Georgia</a>, had taken anti-democratic steps in <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=russia+election">recent elections</a> [JURIST news archives].<br /><br />The UK also <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/china-ignoring-human-rights-in-tibet-uk.php">voiced concern</a> [JURIST report] over the rights situations in many of the same countries in its 2007 report. Earlier this month, the US <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">published its annual reports</a> [JURIST report] on human rights situations in almost 200 countries.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/index.html">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] on Wednesday approved a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.985:">bill</a> [HR 985 materials] that would limit the government&#39;s ability to compel reporters to disclose confidential sources. Under the terms of the Free Flow of Information Act of 2009, parties seeking the identity of confidential sources from reporters in federal court must show that the information relates to an act of terrorism, national security, disclosure of trade secrets, or the imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm. The court must further be convinced that the party seeking the disclosure has exhausted all other means of acquiring the information, and that &quot;the public interest in compelling disclosure of the information or document involved outweighs the public interest in gathering or disseminating news or information&quot;.  The bill also requires that the subject of a disclosure request be informed and given an opportunity to be heard before a communications service provider is compelled to disclose information about his or her activity. The protections in the proposed bill would extend only to reporters who receive &quot;a substantial portion of the person&#39;s livelihood or ... substantial financial gain,&quot; leaving courts free to compel the disclosure of confidential sources from many bloggers. The bill passed the committee on a voice vote, with <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/newsitems/index.php?i=10060">passage expected in the full House</a> [RCFP report].<br /><br />The committee <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/house-judiciary-committee-approves.php">passed a similar bill</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, which was approved by the full house 398-21. The measure died in the Senate under threat of presidential veto, despite a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/senate-judiciary-committee-backs.php">15-2 vote</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website]. The administration of former president George W. Bush continuously opposed the enactment of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=shield+law+-gun+-israeli">federal reporter shield law</a> [JURIST news archive] citing national security concerns, while proponents, including media outlets, argue the legislation is necessary to protect freedom of the press. The bill was first proposed in May 2006, partially in response to the controversial 85-day jailing of <em>New York Times</em> journalist <a href="/jdlsearch.php?q=judith+miller">Judith Miller</a> [JURIST news archive] after she refused to reveal a source to the federal grand jury investigating the <a href="/currentawareness/cialeak.php">leak of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame</a> [JURIST news archive]. Other journalists have faced contempt charges for refusing to reveal sources. In November, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/federal-appeals-court-vacates-locy.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-holds-anthrax-reporter-in.php">contempt order</a> [JURIST report] against former <span style="font-style:italic;">USA Today</span> reporter <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=toni+locy">Toni Locy</a> [JURIST news archive], who had refused to reveal government sources for a series of articles she wrote about the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=anthrax">2001 anthrax attacks</a> [JURIST news archive].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/">New Hampshire House of Representatives</a> [official website] voted 193-174 Wednesday to pass a <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2009/hb0556.html">bill</a> [text] repealing the <a href="/currentawareness/death.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive]. The proposed legislation would amend New Hampshire&#39;s criminal code by extending the definition of first-degree murder to encompass capital murder. The bill would take effect January 1, 2010, but <a href="http://www.governor.nh.gov/">Governor John Lynch</a> (D) [official website] has said that he <a href="http://www.governor.nh.gov/news/2009/032509repeal.html">intends to veto the legislation</a> [news release]. The bill will now come before the <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/senate/">New Hampshire Senate</a> [official website], where it is <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090326/FRONTPAGE/903260319/1037/NEWS04">less likely to pass</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Concord Monitor</span> report], as it has no Senate co-sponsors.<br /><br />Last week, New Mexico <a href="http://www.governor.state.nm.us/index2.php">Governor Bill Richardson</a> (D) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/09%20Regular/bills/house/HB0285.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF; HB 285 <a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/_session.aspx?Chamber=H&LegType=B&LegNo=285&year=09">materials</a>] repealing the death penalty, making New Mexico the second state to abolish the death penalty since the US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] reinstated it nationally in 1976. New Jersey was the first state to <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">pass</a> [JURIST report] such a law in 2007. Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ACT50/003/2009/en/0b789cb1-baa8-4c1b-bc35-58b606309836/act500032009en.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/executions-increase-in-2008-despite.php">report</a>] that global executions rose in 2008.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Vermont <a href="http://governor.vermont.gov/">Governor Jim Douglas</a> (R) [official website] said Wednesday that he would veto a <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/bills/Intro/S-115.pdf">bill</a> [S.0115 text, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/vermont-senate-approves-same-sex.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week by the <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/">Vermont State Senate</a> [official website] that authorizes <a href="/currentawareness/samesex.php">same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST news archive] in the state. In a <a href="http://www.vpr.net/flash/audio_player/audio_player.php?id=27927">statement</a> [Flash audio; <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?NoCache=1&Dato=20090325&Kategori=NEWS03&Lopenr=90325030&Ref=AR">transcript</a>] made to reporters, Douglas said that he announced his position early because he wanted to allow the legislature to focus on more crucial issues. Douglas&#39; opposition to the bill is based on his belief that marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman, and that <a href="http://www.sec.state.vt.us/otherprg/civilunions/civilunions.html">Vermont civil union laws</a> [official backgrounder] provide enough rights and benefits for same-sex couples:<blockquote>Vermont&#8217;s civil union law has extended the same state rights, responsibilities and benefits of marriage to same-sex couples. I believe our civil union law serves Vermont well and I would support congressional action to extend those benefits at the federal level to states that recognize same-sex unions. But like President Obama and other leaders on both sides of the aisle, I believe that marriage should remain between a man and woman.</blockquote>Despite his disapproval of the proposed law, Douglas said that he believes the legislature has enough votes to override his veto. The bill is <a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20090325/NEWS03/90325025/-1/NEWS05">expected to be presented</a> [<em>Burlington Free Press</em> report] before the Vermont House of Representatives next week.<br /><br />On Monday, the Vermont State Senate <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/journal/SJ090323.pdf#page=75%20[http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2010/journal/SJ090323.pdf#page=75]">approved</a> [Senate journal, PDF], by a vote of 26-4, the bill, entitled &quot;An Act to Protect Religious Freedom and Promote Equality in Civil Marriage.&quot; If the proposed legislation passes, Vermont would join <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=massachusetts+marriage">Massachusetts</a> [JURIST news archive] and <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/connecticut-judge-signs-off-on-same-sex.php">Connecticut</a> [JURIST report] in extending marriage rights to same-sex couples. Previously, Vermont became the first state to offer civil unions to same-sex couples when then-Governor Howard Dean signed <a href="http://www.leg.state.vt.us/DOCS/2000/BILLS/PASSED/H-847.HTM">H.B.847</a> [text] into law in April 2000.

		<title>Fourth Circuit rules South Carolina sex offender DNA law is constitutional</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/086169.P.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that a South Carolina <a href="http://www.scstatehouse.gov/CODE/t23c003.htm">law</a> [SC Code &sect;&sect; 23-3-600 et seq. text] requiring convicted first degree sex offenders to submit to a DNA test and pay $250 in processing fees prior to their release does not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html"><em>ex post facto</em> clause</a> [text] of the Constitution. Anthony Eubanks, convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree in April 1995, brought the action against the South Carolina Department of corrections, challenging the constitutionality of the provisions, which took effect in July 1995. In a narrowly tailored ruling, a three-judge panel upheld the district court&#39;s grant of summary judgment against Eubanks, holding that the state DNA Identification Act did not violate the <em>ex post facto</em> clause because DNA gathering was a regulatory, not punitive function. The court also held that the $250 fee was a relatively small sum suggesting that it &quot;was not intended to have a significant retributive or deterrent&quot; function. The court was more troubled by a provision that allowed South Carolina to garnish prisoners&#39; wages to pay the $250 fee but avoided ruling on the issue as the appellant had not brought a due process claim. Finally, the court found that the statutory requirement that the prisoner must pay the $250 fee before he is paroled or released is unenforceable against Eubanks, as this provision is severable from the rest of the statute. <br /><br />This case is the third instance that a court has held that the South Carolina DNA statute does not violate the <em>ex post facto clause</em>. Two South Carolina Court of Appeals rulings previously held that the law was constitutional, including one case <a href="http://www.sccourts.org/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4419">decided</a> [opinion] in June. Federal DNA collection laws have also withstood recent constitutional challenges. In 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dna.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/nj-appeals-court-says-dna-database-for.php">DNA Backlog Elimination Act</a> [JURIST report] that required all felons in federal prison to submit DNA to a national database available to police departments throughout the country. In 2005, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/appeals-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> the constitutionality of an FBI DNA database, and the New Jersey Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/nj-appeals-court-says-dna-database-for.php">upheld</a> a state DNA database for convicted criminals [JURIST reports].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Special Envoy on Climate Change <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/01/115409.htm">Todd Stern</a> [appointment release] said Sunday that the country was <a href="http://unfccc.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090329_AWG_Bonn/templ/ply_page.php?id_kongresssession=1605&player_mode=isdn_real">committed to the creation of an international treaty designed to combat global warming</a> [recorded video, RealPlayer], but that such efforts would only succeed if they were economically feasible. Stern made the comments during the opening of a <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a> (UNFCCC) [official website] <a href="http://unfccc.int/meetings/intersessional/bonn_09/items/4753.php">meeting</a> [materials] in Bonn, Germany. He said that the US would make substantial cuts in its greenhouse gas emissions, but that it was impractical for the country to meet earlier UNFCCC <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20070831_vienna_closing_press_release.pdf">targets</a> [press release] which called for industrial countries to reduce emissions to 60-75% of 1990 levels by 2020. In his own <a href="http://unfccc.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/090329_AWG_Bonn/templ/ply_page.php?id_kongresssession=1604&player_mode=isdn_real">opening remarks</a> [video, RM], UNFCCC Executive Secretary <a href="http://unfccc.int/secretariat/executive_secretary/items/1200.php">Yvo de Boer</a> [official profile], called for both industrialized and developing countries to either cut or slow the increase of emissions, but said that developing countries would likely need financial support in making their cuts. The US on Saturday announced that it would be holding <a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/obama-creates-forum-on-energy-climate/?hp">additional climate change talks</a> [press release] with the 17 countries with the largest economies in April. <br /><br />The purpose of the UNFCCC meeting is to advance the negotiation of a new international agreement to replace the expiring <a href="/currentawareness/kyoto.php">Kyoto Protocol</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Kyoto+protocol">news archive</a>]. Participating countries hope to finalize the agreement in December, and the <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/bangkok_opening_press_release.pdf">agenda</a> [press release, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/new-climate-change-treaty-negotiations.php">report</a>] for the meeting was set last May in Bangkok. General guidelines for the talks were established in the 2007 <a href="http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_13/application/pdf/cp_bali_action.pdf">Bali Roadmap</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/un-climate-conference-pledges-new.php">report</a>] negotiated in Bali, Indonesia. The new deal is expected to enter into force by 2013, following the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012.

The North Korean regime has been the subject of considerable international pressure over its <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hM96sRn69bkN1XDLqb2_pkmFxqdgD972VC400">refusal to fully disclose</a> [AP report] its past nuclear activity.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] issued an <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/notablecases/enron/404cr25/skilling_resentencing_order.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] Friday setting a July 30 date for the resentencing of former <a href="/currentawareness/enron.php">Enron</a> [JURIST news archive] Chief Executive Officer <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=jeff+skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a> [JURIST news archive] and setting up a system for victims to share their accounts with the court. Skilling was convicted in 2006 on 19 counts of conspiracy, insider trading, and securities fraud relating to the collapse of Enron. He appealed the conviction to the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [court website], which <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/fifth-circuit-upholds-convictions-of.php">upheld his conviction</a> [JURIST report] in January. Because of the wide-ranging impact of Skilling&#39;s crimes, Lake&#39;s order requires victims who wish to speak at the sentencing to submit a written summary of their statements in order to condense the opinions that victims and their representatives seek to present to the court during the sentencing hearing. In his order, Judge Sim Lake wrote:<blockquote>Potential crime victims in the case include thousands of former Enron employees, owners of Enron securities, and other persons who were harmed as a result of the crimes for which the defendant will be resentenced. The court concludes that allowing each victim to speak at the defendant&#39;s resentencing hearing could unduly prolong and complicate the resentencing of the defendant. Moreover, if a large number of victims intend to attend the hearing, it will be necessary for the court to make arrangements for adequate seating. ...<br /><br />All persons who believe that they are victims of crimes committed by Mr. Skilling shall notify the court by May 29, 2009, if they wish to be heard at the resentencing hearing, and will briefly explain why they are a crime victim and summarize what they wish to say at the hearing. ... If it appears that multiple victims wish to make the same points, the court may limit the number of victims who speak in order not to unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing hearing.</blockquote>In September 2007, Skilling <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/enron-ex-ceo-skilling-appeals.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] his 2006 <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/enron/3884057.html">conviction</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> backgrounder] to the Fifth Circuit, claiming errors by prosecutors and the trial judge. Skilling was found guilty of providing shareholders with false and misleading information about the fiscal health of the energy company, and initially sentenced to 292 months in prison, three years supervised release and 45 million dollars in restitution. Skilling&#39;s appeal was based on a previous Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C05/05-20319-CR0.wpd.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/federal-appeals-court-overturns.php">report</a>] that overturned convictions for other Enron executives based on &quot;honest services theft&quot; because they had acted in Enron&#39;s best interest by direction and did not profit from their actions. The Fifth Circuit ruled in January that Skilling&#39;s case differed from these previous rulings because &quot;no one at Enron sanctioned Skilling&#8217;s improper conduct&quot; and because Skilling&#39;s compensation structure was aligned with Enron&#39;s earnings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/common/opinions/200903/07-5174-1172578.pdf">upheld the dismissal</a> [opinion, PDF] of a $50 million lawsuit against the US for the 1998 executive order authorizing a missile strike against a Sudan pharmaceutical plant issued by former president <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/williamjClinton/">Bill Clinton</a> [official profile]. The three-judge panel made its decision on grounds that Clinton&#39;s order was purely a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art3frag25_user.html">political question</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and not subject to judicial review. The Clinton administration justified the 1998 missile attacks as a response to terrorist attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, since the pharmaceutical plant owned by El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Company and Salah El Din Ahmed Mohammed Idris was allegedly financed by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/155236.stm">Osama bin Laden</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/binladen.php">news archive</a>] and served as a base for terrorist operations. Plaintiffs El-Shifa and Idris deny any involvement in terrorist operations and filed a defamation and a law of nations claim under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/ch171.html">Federal Torts Claim Act</a> (FTCA) [28 USC &sect; 1346(b)], seeking a declaratory judgment to absolve them from any alleged terrorist connections and compensation for the plant&#39;s allegedly unjustified destruction. While the district court dismissed the claim for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, on appeal, the court relied on the principle that policy choices involving national security and foreign policy are the province of the executive branch and, as a matter of the separation of powers principle, fall outside of the judicial branch&#39;s review:<blockquote>The making of such justifications is itself a policy decision that cannot be separated from the conduct of foreign relations and the exercise of the war power that it explains. Accordingly, we conclude that a decision on the defamation claim would necessarily cross the barrier marked by the political question doctrine. ... Plaintiffs&#8217; defamation claim presents a challenge to the Executive&#8217;s foreign policy and national security decisionmaking, two areas clearly outside our authority. [citations omitted]</blockquote>This was the third attempt of plaintiffs El-Shifa and Idris to recover damages for the destruction of the pharmaceutical plant. The initial suit was filed and dismissed as nonjusticiable in the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website] under the Takings Clause of the US Constitution. The second action, brought as an administrative claim with the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] under the FTCA, was dismissed by the CIA.

The move, recommended by Justice Minister <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Personalities/From+A-Z/Daniel+Friedmann.htm">Daniel Friedmann</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=daniel+friedmann">news archive</a>], is <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1074675.html">intended to pressure Hamas</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Haaretz</span> report] into releasing Israeli soldier <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6238858.stm">Gilad Shalit</a> [BBC Q&amp;A; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=gilad+shalit">news archive</a>], who was captured in Gaza in 2006. The <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/130664">new policy</a> [Arutz Sheva report] will place strict limits on family visits and money transfers, as well as remove opportunities for prisoners to take high school and university classes. The new rules were among the recommendations of a commission established by Friedmann after talks for the release of Shalit failed earlier this month. Freidmann said prisoners will continue to receive visits from the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">Red Cross</a> [organization website], unlike Shalit, who has been denied them since his capture. The <a href="http://www.ips.gov.il/shabas">Israel Prison Service</a> [official website, in Hebrew] has already <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hw963320DDqgzAZerylxxBpkTgcg">begun to act</a> [AFP report] on the recommendations of the commission. <br /><br />Earlier this month, Israeli forces <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israeli-forces-arrest-hamas-leaders.php">arrested 12 Hamas leaders</a> [JURIST report] during raids in the West Bank after Israel and Hamas failed to reach an agreement on a prisoner exchange involving Shalit. Soon after Shalit&#39;s capture, Israel <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/israel-arrests-hamas-leaders-warns-of.php">seized Hamas leaders</a> [JURIST report] including Palestinian Cabinet ministers and lawmakers. Prisoner exchange negotiations between Israel and Hamas have <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/israel-hamas-prisoner-exchange.php">failed before</a>, although Egypt has been <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/egypt-negotiating-release-of-israeli.php">attempting to mediate</a> [JURIST reports] such negotiations since 2006.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/">Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia</a> (ECCC) [official website] began the substantive portion of the first trial of a former <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rogue</a> [BBC backgrounder] leader Monday when <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/duch__313.html">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [Trialwatch backgrounder; <a href="https://www.jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Kaing+Guek+Eav">JURIST news archive</a>] was brought before the court. <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/cambodia-genocide-court-begins-trial-of.php">Pretrial hearings</a> [JURIST report] against Kaing, also known as &quot;Duch,&quot; began last month, but the substantive portion of the trial began when the <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009033025077/National-news/Confession-expected-as-Duch-trial-resumes.html">proceedings resumed</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Phnom Penh Post</span> report] Monday. The <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/260/E26_EN.pdf">schedule of events</a> [closing order, PDF] in the ECCC on Monday included a formal identification of Kaing, a recitation of his rights, and a reading of the <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/courtDoc/115/Closing_order_indicting_Kaing_Guek_Eav_ENG.pdf">charges against him</a> [closing order, PDF], which include war crimes, premeditated murder, and torture. The trial <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/english/cabinet/fileUpload/116/Invitation-EN.pdf">will continue</a> [court document, PDF] with opening statements on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, and after that every Monday through Thursday until early July.<br /><br />Kaing&#39;s trial is the <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/eccc-to-try-up-to-8-khmer-rouge-ex.php">first of eight</a> [JURIST report] that the ECCC hopes to hear against former members of the Khmer Rouge, which has been accused of <a href="http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_cambodia.html">murdering 1.7 million Cambodians</a> [PPU backgrounder] during their nearly four year reign. The ECCC has long been plagued with accusations of corruption and inadequate funding, with greater problems in recent years. Earlier this month, the ECCC reported that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cambodia-war-crimes-court-unable-to-pay.php">unable to pay its Cambodian employees</a> [JURIST report] for that month, one year after the court had <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-seeks.php">requested $114 million dollars from the UN</a> [JURIST report]. In February, Human Rights Watch warned that the ECCC trials were in danger of being tainted for their <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/rights-group-warns-cambodia-khmer-rouge.php">failure to follow fair trial standards</a> [JURIST report], and in January a Cambodian court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/cambodia-genocide-judges-deny.php">agreed to hear a corruption case</a> [JURIST report] involving two ECCC judges.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] lawyer <a href="http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/MemberContentDisplay.aspx?ccmd=ContentDisplay&ucmd=UserDisplay&userid=78">Vijay Padmanabhan</a> [faculty profile] criticized the administration of former president George W. Bush for approving the use of extreme interrogation techniques against terrorism suspects, in an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gjD0weHpCkMwMc94iRSiCgw0UAMQD976KNNG0">interview</a> [AP report] with the Associated Press reported Friday. Padmanabhan, who now teaches at Cardozo School of Law in New York, served as the DOS&#39;s chief counsel on <a href="/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> and <a href="http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=iraq+detention">Iraq</a> [JURIST news archive] detentions, and said that he believed the interrogation tactics used against some detainees constituted torture. He said the Bush administration was wrong to argue that the detainees were not protected by <a href="http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/genevaconventions">Geneva Convention</a> [materials] rights, and that the tactics were an overreaction to the 9/11 attacks against the US. <br /><br />Earlier this month, excerpts from a previously-undisclosed report by the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/">International Committee of the Red Cross</a> (ICRC) [official website] characterizing tactics used against terrorism suspects at Guantanamo as <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22530">torture</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/red-cross-deemed-cia-interrogation.php">report</a>] were published in the <font style="font-style:italic;">New York Review of Books</font>. Also this month, former <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=colin+powell">Colin Powell</a> [JURIST news archive] aide Lawrence Wilkerson criticized the Bush administration for <a href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2009/03/some_truths_abo/">arbitrarily detaining innocent civilians at the base</a> [<font style="font-style:italic;">Washington Notes</font> blog post; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/innocent-prisoners-being-held-at.php">report</a>].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.af/default.asp">Supreme Court of Afghanistan</a> [official website] decided Sunday to allow <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3135938.stm">President Hamid Karzai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karzai">news archive</a>] to remain in office until this August&#39;s <a href="http://www.aopnews.com/lotw/elections2009.shtml">general election</a> [AOP election materials]. Under the <a href="http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/af00000_.html">Afghanistan Constitution</a> [text], Karzai&#39;s term in office expires May 21, but the court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/world/middleeast/30afghan.html?ref=middleeast">held</a> [NYT report] that since the extension of the election until August for security reasons was contrary to the constitution, the extension of Karzai&#39;s presidency would also be appropriate. Karzai&#39;s rivals hoped the court would require the appointment of a temporary government, fearing an extension of his term will give him an unfair advantage in the upcoming election. The court&#39;s decision is not binding. A grand tribunal, made up of approximately 1,000 delegates from around the country, has final authority on issues related to the constitution. A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US Department of State</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/03/120976.htm">welcomed</a> [statement] the court&#39;s ruling, and &quot;call[ed] on the Government of Afghanistan, joined by its international partners, to make every effort to ensure that the conditions are created for genuinely free and fair elections that will reflect the will of the Afghan people.&quot;<br /><br />Previous Afghani elections have been marred by allegations of fraud, allowing officials to remain in power beyond the expiration of their terms while results were reviewed. In 2005, the <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/afghanistan-assembly-election-results.php">official results</a> of the assembly elections were not available for nearly two months due to <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/fraud-investigation-delays-afghan.php">allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST reports]. During that election a joint electoral board formed between Afghanistan and UN found that the irregularities <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/fraud-allegations-wont-mar-afghan.php">were not enough</a> [JURIST report] to call the results into question.

Garzon&#39;s request comes after a <a href="http://www.publico.es/resources/archivos/2009/3/27/1238184153397QUERELLA_VERSION_FINAL.pdf">criminal complaint</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] was <a href="http://www.publico.es/internacional/213753/querella/espanola/prision/guantanamo">filed last week</a> [<em>Publico</em> report, in Spanish] in the <a href="http://www.audiencianacional.es/">Audiencia Nacional</a> [official website] against six lawyers from the administration of former US president George W.

The lawsuit, brought under Spain&#39;s universal jurisdiction statute, alleges that the six lawyers committed crimes against the international community, as well as crimes against persons and property protected during armed conflict, in violation of the Spanish constitution, as well as the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">Geneva Conventions</a> [ICRC materials] and the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [UN materials].<br /><br />Garzon, famed for indicting <a href="https://www.jurist.org/currentawareness/binladen.php">Osama bin Laden</a> and former Latin American dictator <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/pinochet.php">Augusto Pinochet</a> [JURIST news archives], is well known for his involvement in high-profile investigations of terror and human rights cases.  Last October, he <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the exhumation of 19 mass graves in Spain, launching an investigation into the disappearances of tens of thousands of people beginning in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A882902">Spanish Civil War</a> [BBC backgrounder], and continuing through the early years of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco dictatorship</a> [BBC backgrounder].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called Sunday for the US and <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=yemen">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive] to agree on a repatriation plan that provides &quot;meaningful legal process&quot; for the nearly 100 Yemeni detainees still at <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=guantanamo+bay">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive]. A new HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/ct0309web.pdf">report</a> [PDF; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/29/usyemen-break-impasse-yemeni-returns-guantanamo">press release</a>] criticized any proposal involving indefinite suspension at a Yemeni facility and expressed fears of detainee mistreatment after repatriation. The organization called for genuine rehabilitation efforts, questioning a Yemeni proposal in which detainees could be held for more than a year and face movement restrictions after release. The report called on Yemen to comply with the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm">UN Convention against Torture</a> [text] and commit to fair trials for any detainees who are charged. HRW&#39;s fears of detainee mistreatment are based in part on its follow-up with the 14 Yemeni detainees who have already been repatriated. One said he was beaten by investigators during his two-year detention. The report asked the US to refrain from pressuring Yemen to hold detainees without charges and called for a <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=truth+commission">truth commission</a> [JURIST news archive] to investigate alleged abuse of detainees. Any detainee who cannot return to Yemen due to a credible fear of persecution should be resettled in a safe third country, the report said.<br /><br />In January, US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] issued an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] directing the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within one year. In July 2008, Yemeni officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/yemen-officials-discuss-transfer-of.php">met with a visiting US delegation</a> [JURIST report] to discuss the possible transfer of Yemeni detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, with the US voicing concerns that they would be freed upon their return. In October 2007, US officials <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/yemen-official-denies-release-of-uss.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Yemeni government over reports that it had released suspected <em>USS Cole</em> bomber <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/jamal_al_badawi.htm">Jamal al-Badawi</a> [GlobalSecurity profile] after he turned himself in. In May 2007, a senior Yemeni official said the country had <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/yemen-agrees-to-take-most-yemeni.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to receive most Yemeni detainees being held at Guantanamo. In June 2006, Yemeni officials <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/yemen-calls-for-probe-into-guantanamo.php">called for investigations</a> into the Guantanamo suicides of <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/breaking-news-three-guantanamo.php">three detainees</a> [JURIST reports], including one Yemeni national, saying that the deaths exemplified the &quot;inhumane conditions of detainees&quot; at the US military prison.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Advocacy group <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] has called on the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/las/index.jsp">League of Arab States</a> [official website, in Arabic] to urge <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7502973.stm">Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=bashir">news archive</a>] to allow <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-may-investigate-sudan-for-expelling.php">expelled foreign aid agencies</a> [JURIST report] back into the country, according to a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/81934">letter</a> [text; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/29/arab-states-press-sudan-darfur-aid">press release</a>] released by HRW on Monday. Bashir took the action after the&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a>&nbsp;(ICC) [official website]&nbsp;issued a&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-issues-sudan-president-arrest.php">warrant</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] for his arrest on war crimes charges. HRW warned that the expulsion of the agencies has effectively cut in half the aid going to Darfur refugees, and that some camps are now without clean water or medical care. HRW also urged the Arab League to abandon its calls for the UN Security Council to exercise its <a href="http://www.un.org/children/conflict/keydocuments/english/romestatuteofthe7.html">power to suspend the charges</a> [Rome Statute text] against Bashir, saying that such action is unwarranted and would only prolong existing problems in the country:<blockquote>Human Rights Watch believes that a deferral would be wholly inappropriate in the current context.  It would reward the denial of vital assistance to vulnerable populations-thereby encouraging further abuses-and would risk impunity for widespread atrocities without identifiable benefits for international peace and security.<br /><br />The peace process for Darfur has long been stalled, as you know, because of lack of political will to end the conflict that is unrelated to the ICC.  Although the Sudanese government and one rebel group, JEM, signed a &quot;declaration of intent&quot; in February 2009, it did not include any significant concessions or a commitment to a ceasefire.  Moreover, as a suspension under article 16 is limited to 12-month periods, once a deferral takes effect, the Sudanese government can be expected to use annual threats of violence and empty promises to secure renewals.</blockquote> The Arab League has maintained that the warrant against Bashir <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-bashir-derides-icc.php">threatens</a> [JURIST report] the country&#39;s peace process, a claim which HRW rejects. Despite the call by HRW, Arab League leaders <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/world/africa/31arab.html?_r=1&hp">reiterated their support</a> [NYT report] for Bashir during an annual meeting Monday.<br /><br />Last week, ICC Chief Prosecutor&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] said that Bashir&#39;s decision to expel the groups&nbsp;<a href="/paperchase/2009/03/icc-prosecutor-criticizes-sudan.php">demonstrates that the ICC was justified</a>&nbsp;[JURIST report] in pursuing the charges against him.&nbsp;Bashir has also <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-bashir-threatens-to.php">threatened to expel</a> [JURIST report] any remaining agencies, diplomats and peacekeepers in Sudan. Human rights and other groups have previously <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/sudan-president-war-crimes-warrant-met.php">urged Bashir</a> [JURIST report] to allow the agencies to remain in the country, and UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] spokesman Rupert Colville has said that his office <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-may-investigate-sudan-for-expelling.php">may investigate</a> [JURIST report] whether Sudan&#39;s removal of the groups itself is a possible breach of human rights law or war crime.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Humans Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Friday <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/03/27/syria-flawed-court-resumes-prosecutions">criticized</a> [text] the resumption of activities by Syria&#39;s Supreme State Security Court (SSSC), and called for its dissolution. HRW called the court&#39;s activities a violation of the right to a fair trial in part because it does not follow procedural rules of Syria&#39;s criminal courts and does not allow defendants to appeal its verdicts. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/bios/sarah-leah-whitson">Sarah Leah Whitson</a> [official profile], director of the Middle East and North Africa division of HRW, expressed dismay over the reopening of the court:<blockquote>The resumption of business in this kangaroo court is a distressing signal that Syrian authorities have no interest in addressing their flawed justice system...Instead of revealing the fate of those detained in Sednaya and referring the accused to courts that can actually dispense justice, they decided to resume sentencing defendants in a court that rubber-stamps whatever the security services want.</blockquote>According to the report, the SSSC had been disbanded in July following a riot at the Sednaya prison, where many detainees were awaiting hearings in the court. Syrian officials <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h19fbOo_plYpSRHZOxj-TCAmfcRgD976IIKO1">have not confirmed</a> [AP report] whether the court has actually reopened. <br /><br />HRW has often accused Syria of using the SSSC in forwarding its political goals. In February, HRW issued a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/en/node/80952/">report</a> [report materials] detailing how Syria used the SSSC to silence critics and criminalize freedom of expression. In 2004, HRW called on Syria to <a href="http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/03/19/syria8132.htm">try suspects in civilian courts rather than in the security courts</a> [HRW report].  HRW has also accused Syria of &quot;systematic discrimination&quot; against Kurds, including the <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm">arbitrary denial of citizenship to Syria-born Kurds</a> [HRW report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thousands protested the proposed liberalization of Spain&#39;s abortion laws in Madrid on Sunday. The changes, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/spain-panel-proposes-sweeping-abortion.php">proposed earlier this month</a> [JURIST report], include allowing abortions up to week 14 of pregnancy for any reason and lowering the age required for an abortion from 18 to 16. These reforms are in sharp contrast with the current law, established in 1985, which allows women over the age of 18 the right to abort only up to 12 weeks in cases of rape, up to 22 weeks in cases of fetal malformation, and at any stage where there are serious health risks to the mother. In protests organized by pro-life groups <a href="http://derechoavivir.org/">Derecho a Vivir</a>, <a href="http://www.hazteoir.org/">Hazte Oir</a>, <a href="http://www.medicosporlavida.org/">Medicos por la Vida</a> and <a href="http://www.grupoprovida.com/">Provida Madrid</a> [advocacy websites, in Spanish], demonstrators chanted &quot;no right to kill, right to life&quot; and urged the government <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jxnSKnyyF2sRech379z76wsoM1VA">not to adopt the proposed changes</a> [AFP report]. <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/sociedad/manifestacion/aborto/reune/10000/personas/Madrid/elpepusoc/20090329elpepusoc_2/Tes">Similar demonstrations</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] took place in cities throughout Spain on Sunday.      <br /><br />The panel tasked with investigating changes to Spanish abortion law was <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-panel-to-consider-abortion-law.php">formed in September</a> [JURIST report] at the request of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero as part of a series of social reforms including the <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">legalization of same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] and streamlined divorce proceedings. Since the committee was formed, the conservative <a href="http://www.pp.es/">Popular Party</a> [official website, in Spanish] has repeatedly <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/opinion/PP/aborto/elpepuopi/20090220elpepiopi_6/Tes">expressed the opinion</a> [<span style="font-style:italic;">El Pais</span> report, in Spanish] that relaxed abortion laws would stand in opposition to <a href="http://www.gva.es/cidaj/pdf/constitucion.pdf">Article 15 of the Spanish Constitution</a> [text, in Spanish], which guarantees the right to life.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/orders/courtorders/033009zor.pdf">agreed</a> [order list, PDF] Monday to hear oral arguments in the case of <u>South Carolina v. North Carolina</u> to decide whether additional parties may intervene in a lawsuit between two states, over which the Court has original jurisdiction. A special master <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/SpecMastRpt/Orig138_112808.pdf">recommended</a> [report, PDF] that three parties - the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, the Catawba River Water Supply Project, and Duke Energy Carolinas - be allowed to intervene in the lawsuit brought by South Carolina over water flows from the Catawba River. The state of South Carolina and the US government both dispute that recommendation, arguing that the states should speak for the interests of all their citizens.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pakistan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4032997.stm">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=asif+ali+zardari">news archive</a>] Saturday announced the formation of a parliamentary committee to examine the revision of key terms of the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/">Pakistan Constitution</a> [text]. The revisions would include the elimination of the controversial <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/amendments/17amendment.html">17th Amendment</a> [text] and Article 58-2(B), which give the president extraordinary power over Pakistani elected bodies, including the power to dissolve the country&#39;s parliament and remove individual MPs. News of the <a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=72983">formation of the committee</a> [<em>The News</em> report] came in an address to a joint session of the parliament by Zardari, who invoked the memory of assassinated former prime minister <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=benazir+bhutto">Benazir Bhutto</a> [JURIST news archive] in making the announcement. <br /><br />The formation of the parliamentary committee comes towards the end of a month of political turmoil in Pakistan which culminated in the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-ousted-chief-justice-to-be.php">reinstatement</a> [JURIST report] of Chief Justice <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Chaudhry">Iftikhar Chaudhry Mohammed</a> [JURIST news archive] of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7310028.stm">Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani</a> [BBC profile] announced early last week that the government would reinstate Chaudhry in response to recent protests by members of the lawyers&#39; movement and opposition politicians and supporters. Reports first surfaced in mid-March that President Zardari had agreed to reinstate Chaudhry and other judges ousted by Zardari&#39;s predecessor Pervez Musharraf in November 2007 after his declaration of emergency rule. Former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6959782.stm">Nawaz Sharif</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nawaz+sharif">news archive</a>] and his <a href="http://www.pmln.org.pk/">Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz</a> (PML-N) [party website] have <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/pakistan-ex-pm-leads-march-for-judges.php">actively campaigned</a> [JURIST report] for Chaudhry&#39;s reinstatement. Throughout the period of his removal Chaudhry insisted that <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/ousted-pakistan-chief-justice-claims.php">he was still chief justice</a> [JURIST report] under the Pakistani constitution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] sergeant was convicted Monday and sentenced to 35 years in prison for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/world/middleeast/27abuse.html?_r=1">killing four unarmed Iraqi prisoners</a> [NYT report] in 2007. Sgt. First Class Joseph Mayo, formerly of the <a href="http://www.18inf.org/affiliation.htm">1st Battalion, 18th Infantry</a> [official website] and two other soldiers were <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/three-us-soldiers-charged-with-murder.php">charged in September</a> [JURIST report] with shooting the four bound and blindfolded prisoners and disposing of their bodies in a canal. Mayo pleaded guilty at his court-martial proceeding Monday, saying he shot the prisoners because he feared they would be released due to lack of evidence against them. The killings followed a series of attacks against US troops and may have been retribution for the deaths of two US soldiers. Sgt. John Hatley, also charged in the killings, <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/second-us-soldier-to-face-court-martial.php">faces court martial proceedings</a> [JURIST report] beginning April 13. According to Mayo&#39;s lawyer, Mayo has <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hYtcV7GUHRC88uGXnQ8Hl6I5lvbAD978E4LO0">agreed to testify against Hatley</a> [AP report].<br /><br />The third man charged, Sgt. Michael Leahy Jr., was <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-army-sergeant-convicted-in-murder-of.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in February and sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Staff Sgt. Jess Cunningham, originally an alleged co-conspirator against whom charges were dropped, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-army-sergeant-convicted-in-murder-of.php">testified against Leahy</a> [JURIST report] at his trial. Fellow unit members Spc. Belmor Ramon and Spc. Steven Ribordy pleaded guilty last year to <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-conspiracy.php">conspiracy</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-accessory.php">accessory to murder</a> [JURIST reports], respectively, in connection with the incident.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israeli military officials closed an internal investigation Monday into allegations of war crimes committed by <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/">Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] personnel against Palestinian civilians, concluding that <a href="http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/today/09/03/3001.htm">there was no wrongdoing</a> [press release]. The investigation was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-military-orders-internal.php">launched last week</a> [JURIST report] by the IDF in response to comments made by soldiers concerning reports of civilian killings and vandalism under liberal rules of engagement during a recent operation in the Gaza Strip. Dismissing the soldiers&#39; reports as &quot;hearsay,&quot; the IDF investigation concluded that the soldiers&#39; comments were exaggerated, and repetition of rumors that circulated among forces operating in Gaza and not based on the actual observations of the soldiers who made the allegations. Military Advocate General Brigadier Avichai Mendelbilt said:<blockquote>It is unfortunate that none of the speakers at the conference was careful to be accurate in the depiction of his claims, and even more so that they chose to present various incidents of a severe nature, despite not personally witnessing and knowing much about them. It seems that it will be difficult to evaluate the damage done to the image and morals of the IDF and its soldiers, who had participated in Operation Cast Lead, in Israel and the world.</blockquote>Word of the investigation came as UN Special Rapportuer on human rights in the Palestinian territories <a href="http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/1ce874ab1832a53e852570bb006dfaf6/0da4ba56ade85249852574190058d462!OpenDocument">Richard Falk</a> [appointment release] issued a <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/10session/A.HRC.10.20.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website], in which Falk criticized Israel for failing to take adequate precautions to distinguish between civilians and combatants in their offensives in the region. Falk called for an independent investigation into the alleged crimes, which he said included the targeting of hospitals and mosques, the use of white phosphorus incendiary bombs in heavily populated areas, as well as Israel&#39;s blockade of the Gaza Strip. Both Israel and the US have <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/israel-us-criticize-biased-un-rights.php">criticized the report</a> [JURIST report] as biased. Two weeks ago, a group of 16 human rights investigators and judges sent an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.nz/archived_news/experts_seek_gaza_inquiry+">open letter</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/human-rights-leaders-call-for.php">report</a>] to UN Secretary-General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ban+ki-moon">news archive</a>] and the UN Security Council calling for an investigation into the alleged crimes. Earlier this month, Iran announced that it would seek <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/iran-to-seek-interpol-arrest-warrants.php">INTERPOL arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for Israeli war crimes suspects. In January, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/D78B7DAC697D3060C1257539003B5F3A?opendocument">called for an independent investigation</a> [statement text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/un-rights-head-calls-for-investigation.php">report</a>] of possible war crimes and human rights violations in Gaza. <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo is also <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/palestinian-leaders-urge-icc.php">attempting to gain jurisdiction over Israel</a> [JURIST report] to investigate its actions in Gaza for alleged war crimes. Israel has already <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/israel-pm-asks-justice-minister-to.php">begun to consider defenses against possible war crimes charges</a>, partly based on <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rights-group-accuses-israel-of-war.php">accusations</a> [JURIST reports] that it used white phosphorus in a civilian area.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Greek authorities are not doing enough to ensure that the nation&#39;s police respect human rights, according to a Monday <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR25/001/2009/en/5ceca451-887b-4636-b241-6ce3b1185f8c/eur250012009en.pdf">briefing</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/greece-policing-demonstrations-responsibly-20090330">press release</a>] from <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] urging the government to investigate and address &quot;long-standing problems of policing.&quot; AI said allegations of human-rights abuses, including torture, the use of excessive force, arbitrary detentions, and denial of prompt legal assistance, continue to be lodged against Greek police. AI&#39;s briefing sets forth recommendations for helping Greece comply with its obligations under the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/nr/rdonlyres/d5cc24a7-dc13-4318-b457-5c9014916d7a/0/englishanglais.pdf">European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</a> [text, PDF] and the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text]. The recommendations include establishing an independent commission to investigate and publish a report about the December 2008 <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7769710.stm">shooting death of 15-year-old Alexis Grigoropoulos</a> [BBC report] and the protests that ensued; implementing measures to prevent police from using excessive force when responding to demonstrations; and investigating patterns of alleged abuses that have diminished public confidence in policing. Greece has not responded to the AI briefing.<br /><br />The Greek government said earlier this month that it would <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/greece-to-enlist-uk-help-in.php">revamp its police force</a> [JURIST report] in light of December <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7798056.stm">demonstrations and riots</a> [BBC backgrounder] that occurred in response to Grigoropoulos&#39; death. An Athens police officer shot and killed Grigoropoulos after he and other youths allegedly threw stones at a police car. Police said Grigoropoulos was shot as he tried to hurl an explosive at officers. Demonstrations and riots protesting the shooting took place for weeks after Grigoropoulos&#39; death. The officer who shot Grigoropoulos was suspended and charged with manslaughter. The Greek police have been <a href="/forumy/2008/12/riots-in-greece-law-order-and-police.php">accused of being both ineffective and unnecessarily violent</a> [JURIST op-ed] in their response to the protests.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on Friday ordered the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] to release reports on the destruction of 92 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cia+videotape">videotapes</a> [JURIST news archive] of high value terrorism suspect interrogations within the next 30 days or alternatively, explain why it should not do so. <a href="http://www1.nysd.uscourts.gov/judge_info.php?id=86">Judge Alvin Hellerstein</a> [official profile] directed the CIA to disclose the reports along with a list of witnesses as part of the ongoing <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/torturefoia.html#">lawsuit</a> [ACLU materials] brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/index.html">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] in an effort to access government materials on the interrogations under the  <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/foiastat.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text]. The ACLU has argued that the destruction of the videotapes <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/33152prs20071212.html">violated a 2004 order</a> [ACLU press release] by Hellerstein which instructed the CIA to turn over all records pertaining to the treatment of detainees, and that the CIA should be held in contempt for failing to preserve the records. A <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/doj-opens-criminal-probe-into-cia.php">criminal probe</a> [JURIST report] into the destruction of the videotapes is currently ongoing. <br /><br />Earlier this month, the US <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] acknowledged the CIA <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/lettertohellerstein_ciainterrogationtapes.pdf">destroyed</a> [letter, PDF] 92 videotapes of terrorism suspect interrogations, in response to an August 2008 <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/safefree/hellerstein_order.pdf">judicial order</a> [text, PDF] that the CIA turn over information regarding the tapes or provide specific justifications on why it could not release the information. Additionally, the DOJ admitted in court <a href="http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/030609/paragraph_77.pdf">documents</a> [text, PDF], that <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/cia-destroyed-92-interrogation-tapes.php">twelve of the 92 videotapes destroyed by the CIA</a> [JURIST report] contained evidence of &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques.&quot; The ACLU <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/ccr,-et-al.-v.-dept.-defense-et-al.">brought its lawsuit</a> [CCR backgrounder] after the October 2003 request filed by the ACLU under FOIA for information pertaining to US held detainees in overseas facilities received in answer only a set of media talking points used by the Department of State.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a>&nbsp;[official website] granted a <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/batarfi----jointmotionstayfinal.pdf">joint motion</a> [text, PDF] Monday for a stay of proceedings against&nbsp;Yemeni <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST news archive] detainee Ayman Saeed Batarfi,&nbsp;allowing for his eventual transfer. Batarfi, one of the longest held terror suspects at the military prison, had been detained without charges as an <a href="/currentawareness/enemycombatants.php">enemy combatant</a> [JURIST news archive] since his 2001 capture at the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/1723978.stm">Battle of Tora Bora</a> [BBC report] in Afghanistan. He had been detained for&nbsp;alleged association with&nbsp;al Qaeda forces during the battle, but his lawyers argued&nbsp;that he had been forced to administer medical treatment to al Qaeda forces. After a review of his case, the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] agreed that it did not have grounds to hold Batarfi, and joined in the motion to end proceedings against him. The US is currently searching for an appropriate destination country for Batarfi, and his release date has not been set.<br /><br />The announcement follows a call by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Sunday for the US and <a href="/countries/yemen.php">Yemen</a> [JURIST news archive] to agree on a repatriation plan that provides &quot;meaningful legal process&quot; for the nearly 100 Yemeni detainees still at Guantanamo Bay. The repartiation plan dates back to July 2008, when Yemeni officials <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/yemen-officials-discuss-transfer-of.php">met with a visiting US delegation</a> [JURIST report] to discuss the possible transfer of Yemeni detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, with the US voicing concerns that they would be freed upon their return. The stay of proceedings against Batarfi follows a January <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Closure_Of_Guantanamo_Detention_Facilities/">executive order</a> [text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">report</a>] from US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president_obama/">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] directing the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility within one year and a review and disposition of all individuals held at the facility.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge in the <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">US District for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] issued a <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/MillerTROorder33009.pdf">temporary restraining order</a> [text, PDF] Monday blocking child pornography charges against three teenage girls who appeared in photographs distributed by cell phone throughout their high school. Wyoming County District Attorney George Skumanick Jr. had told the girls and their parents that unless the girls completed an after-school re-education program, they <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SEXTING_LAWSUIT?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">would be charged</a> [AP report] with distributing child pornography. In Pennsylvania, it is a felony to have or distribute pictures of minors engaged in lewd activity or provocatively exposed. None of the pictures of the girls revealed anything below the waist, and all were taken over a year ago. None of the <a href="http://www.scrantontimes.com/articles/2009/03/31/news/sc_times_trib.20090331.a.pg1.tt31sexting_s1.2410585_top3.txt">students responsible for disseminating the photos</a> [<em>Scranton Times</em> report] has been charged. Judge James Munley found that all factors for issuing a temporary restraining order had been met and scheduled a hearing on the merits for June. <br /><br />The plaintiffs are represented by the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> (ACLUPA) [advocacy website] and <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/downloads/MillerComplaintfinal.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF; case <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/legal/legaldocket/milleretalvskumanick">materials</a>] against Skumanick last week. ACLUPA lawyer Witold Walczak <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/pressroom/aclusueswyomingcountydafor.htm">contends</a> [press release] that the photos are protected by the First Amendment and that requiring the girls to attend a re-education program interferes wit the parents&#39; rights to raise their daughters as they wish. According to the complaint, <a href="http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/sextech/PDF/SexTech_Summary.pdf">20 percent of teens nationwide</a> [survey results; PDF] have participated in the distribution of similar pictures, a phenomenon known as &#39;sexting.&#39;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Afghan <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3135938.stm">President Hamid Karzai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karzai">news archive</a>] has signed into law a bill which significantly reduces women&#39;s rights, including legalizing rape within a marriage, the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/31/hamid-karzai-afghanistan-law">reported</a> [text] Tuesday. Critics allege that Karzai signed this bill, which has not yet been made public, to increase support among Afghan <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/subdivisions/sunnishia_1.shtml">Shia</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1608289.stm">Hazara</a> [BBC backgrounders] who support the law, ultimately to improve his re-election chances. This very scenario is one Karzai&#39;s political opponents feared when the the Afghanistan Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/afghanistan-high-court-extends.php">extended the presidential term</a> [JURIST report] until August amid safety concerns regarding the upcoming election. The Afghan presidential election will take place on August 20th, 2009, with likely challengers including former interior minister Ali Ahmad Jalali, ex-finance ministers Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Anwarul Haq Ahadi, and former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah.<br /><br />Karzai has experienced a tumultuous career since his appointment as interim President in 2002. In early March, the UN reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-warns-afghanistan.php">human rights situation in Afghanistan is worsening</a> [JURIST report], one week after a similar US report rebuked Afghanistan for, among other problems, <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/us-state-department-releases-annual.php">continued use of child labor</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the UN urged Afghanistan to <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-human-rights-chief-urges-end-to.php">discontinue use of the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], which Karzai had <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/afghanistan-ends-death-penalty.php">reinstated following a four-year moratorium</a> [JURIST report]. In April 2008, the Taliban <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/28/afghanistan">attempted to assassinate Karzai</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] during a military parade, the third attempt on his life since 2001.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ussupremes.php">news archive</a>] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1216.pdf">dismissed</a> as improvidently granted the writ of <em>certiorari</em> in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-1216">Philip Morris USA v. Williams</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-hears-tobacco-federal.php">report</a>]. The Court had originally granted <em>certiorari</em> to consider for a third time a $79.5 million punitive damages verdict against tobacco company <a href="http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/home.asp">Philip Morris USA</a> [corporate website]. The Court <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/supreme-court-overturns-philip-morris.php">previously ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the punitive damages award based &quot;in part on [a jury&#39;s] desire to <em>punish</em> the defendant for harming persons who are not before the court&quot; amounts to an unconstitutional taking of property without due process. On remand, the <a href="http://www.ojd.state.or.us/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of Oregon</a> [official website] again <a href="http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/S051805.htm">upheld</a> [opinion text] the verdict, finding that it did not need to reach the federal constitutional issue if there was &quot;an independent and adequate&quot; basis in state law for upholding the verdict.<br /><br />The Court released two other opinions Tuesday. In <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-1372">Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/supreme-court-hears-identity-theft.php">report</a>], the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-1372.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] unanimously that the state of Hawaii is not precluded from transferring 1.2 million acres of land ceded by the former Hawaiian monarchy, pending a political settlement with <a href="http://www.nativehawaiians.com/">Native Hawaiians</a> [advocacy website]. The <a href="http://www.oha.org/">Office of Hawaiian Affairs</a> (OHA) [official website] had won an <a href="http://www.state.hi.us/jud/opinions/sct/2008/25570.pdf">injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] from the Hawaii Supreme Court barring the state from selling any ceded lands until claims to the land are settled. The state of Hawaii argued that the <a href="http://www.hawaii-nation.org/publawall.html">1993 Apology Resolution</a> [text] passed by Congress was not intended to limit the state&#39;s ability to manage its land. Reversing the lower court ruling, Justice Samuel Alito wrote:<blockquote>Here, the State Supreme Court incorrectly held that Congress, by adopting the Apology Resolution, took away from the citizens of Hawaii the authority to resolve an issue that is of great importance to the people of the State. Respondents defend that decision by arguing that they have both state-law property rights in the land in question and &quot;broader moral and political claims for compensation for the wrongs of the past.&quot; But we have no authority to decide questions of Hawaiian law or to provide redress for past wrongs except as provided for by federal law. [citations omitted]</blockquote>The Hawaiian monarchy was <a href="http://hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&CategoryID=259">overthrown</a> [historical timeline] in 1893, and the US annexed its territory five years later. Hawaii was admitted as a state in 1959.<br /><br />In a second unanimous decision, the Court <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/08pdf/07-9995.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/07-9995">Rivera v. Illinois</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/supreme-court-hears-indian-mining-lease.php">report</a>] that an Illinois trial court did not err in refusing to grant a defense counsel&#39;s peremptory challenge to dismiss from a murder trial a juror who worked at a hospital that treated a larger number of gunshot wounds. After raising the challenge during jury selection, the trial court overruled the challenge and seated the juror. At the start of the trial, defense counsel again challenged the juror in juror&#39;s presence. That challenge was again denied, and the juror was appointed foreperson of the jury, with knowledge that the defendant&#39;s counsel had attempted to remove her from the jury. Rivera was found guilty of murder, and sentenced to 85 years in prison. Delivering the opinion of the Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote:<blockquote>Nothing in these decisions suggests that federal law renders state-court judgments void whenever there is a state-law defect in a tribunal&#39;s composition. Absent a federal constitutional violation, States retain the prerogative to decide whether such errors deprive a tribunal of its lawful authority and thus require automatic reversal. States are free to decide, as a matter of state law, that a trial court&#39;s mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge is reversible error per se. Or they may conclude, as the Supreme Court of Illinois implicitly did here, that the improper seating of a competent and unbiased juror does not convert the jury into an ultra vires tribunal; therefore the error could rank as harmless under state law.<br /><br />In sum, Rivera received precisely what due process required: a fair trial before an impartial and properly instructed jury, which found him guilty of every element of the charged offense.</blockquote>The ruling affirmed the <a href="http://www.state.il.us/court/Opinions/SupremeCourt/2007/November/98609.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the Illinois Supreme Court, upholding Rivera&#39;s conviction.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The South African <a href="http://www.supremecourtofappeal.gov.za/index.htm">Supreme Court of Appeal</a> (SCA) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourtofappeal.gov.za/judgments/sca_2009/sca09-036.pdf">held</a> [judgment, PDF; <a href="http://www.supremecourtofappeal.gov.za/judgments/sca_2009/sca09-036%20ms.pdf">media summary</a>, PDF] that the judges of the <a href="http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/home.htm">Constitutional Court</a> [official website] acted lawfully in filing a grievance against Cape Judge President John Hlophe alleging that Hlophe had tried to influence their decision in a corruption case against African National Congress (ANC) leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4615019.stm">Jacob Zuma</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=zuma">news archive</a>]. The judges appealed a decision by the High Court at Johannesburg finding that Hlophe had a right to be heard before the court submitted its complaint to the country&#39;s judicial disciplinary body, the <a href="http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/docs/view.php?doc=879">Judicial Service Commission</a> (JSC) [backgrounder, DOC]. The SCA overruled the High Court decision, finding that since the judges were &quot;not performing a judicial function&quot; in filing the complaint, they were not obligated to provide Hlohpe an opportunity to be heard. The SCA further held that the publication of the allegations in the media was not improper in light of the judges&#39; belief that another member of the judiciary was acting unlawfully, saying that:<blockquote>It will always be distressing for a judge to learn in the media that he or she has been accused of misconduct but that seems to us to be an inevitable hazard of holding public office. ... [W]e do not think that his or her remedy lies in stifling the fact that a complaint has been made.</blockquote>The SCA noted that Hlophe&#39;s relief would be to fight the complaint in the JCS proceedings, and to sue for defamation if the allegations prove false.<br /><br />The judges of the Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/south-africa-high-court-says-judge.php">filed their complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the JCS last June, alleging that Hlophe had unlawfully tried to influence their decision in the Zuma corruption case in violation of the <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/96conssec2.htm#6">constitutional prohibition</a> [Schedule 2, Item 6 text] against administering justice with favor or prejudice. Hlophe&#39;s alleged unconstitutional behavior relates to a March hearing to determine whether raids on Zuma&#39;s home <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/zuma-asks-south-africa-constitutional.php">violated his rights to privacy and a fair trial</a> [JURIST report]. Zuma has been facing <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7153378.stm">corruption allegations</a> [BBC timeline] and other charges for several years. He was first charged with corruption in 2005, but those charges were later <a href="/paperchase/2006/09/south-africa-judge-dismisses-zuma.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] because prosecutors failed to follow proper procedures.

O&#39;Brien, who was visiting the Rwandan capital Kigali, <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/PRESSREL/2009/590.html">met last week</a> [press release] with ICTR president Judge Dennis Byron, prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow, as well as Rwandan prosecutor general Martin Ngoga and discussed setting up a &quot;residual mechanism&quot; to deal with future genocide suspects, such as the <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200903020132.html">thirteen fugitives</a> [<em>New Times</em> report] still at large, once the tribunal is expected to <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/rwanda-genocide-tribunal-seeks-more.php">shut down</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 as per a <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/Resolutions/s-res-1503e.pdf">UN resolution</a> [text, PDF]. O&#39;Brien also added that the decision would have to be made by the UN Security Council and the ICTR judges.<br /><br />The UN resolution had called for &quot;all trial activities at first instance&quot; to end by 2008,  leaving the status of those suspects who had been arrested but not tried, such as <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/jean-baptiste_gatete_216.html">Jean-Baptiste Gatete</a> [TrialWatch profile], in limbo. The ICTR had earlier <a href="http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/cases/Gatete/decisions/081117.pdf">denied</a> [decision; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/ictr-recognizes-rwanda-judicial.php">report</a>] Rwanda&#39;s request to transfer Gatete into its custody  because of fears that he would not get a fair trial in Rwanda. There was concern that he might not be able to call on witnesses residing outside Rwanda or that the these witnesses might be afraid to testify for the defense.

FBL Financial Services</a> [oral arguments transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/supreme-court-takes-al-marri-detainee.php">report</a>], in which the Court will decide whether a plaintiff must present direct evidence of discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction in a non-<a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html">Title VII</a> [text] discrimination case. The case involves an executive, Jack Gross, who claims he was passed over for a promotion at <a href="http://www.fblfinancial.com/">FBL Financial Services</a> [corporate website] in favor of a younger employee in violation of the <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html">Age Discrimination in Employment Act</a> (ADEA) [text]. In 2003, the Court ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-679.ZS.html">Desert Palace v. Costa</a> [opinion text] that direct evidence - evidence linking an adverse employment action to a specific motive - is not required in a mixed-motive case under Title VII, but left open the issue of whether direct evidence would be required outside the Title VII context.

Counsel for Gross argued: &quot;The court of appeals erred in holding that the plaintiff had to have direct evidence in order to obtain the specific instruction at issue in this case. ... [T]his Court had at no time imposed a direct evidence requirement without an affirmative directive from Congress to do so.&quot; Counsel for FBL &quot;urge[d] the Court not to evaluate this case strictly on the question of whether direct versus circumstantial evidence is the appropriate way to proceed,&quot; saying:<blockquote>I would hope that the Court would seize upon this as an opportunity to provide some significant clarity in the law, rather than seize this as an opportunity to decide this case on the potentially most narrow ground, which, frankly, as far as I can tell, will not only not decide this case, ultimately, but certainly will not do anything to resolve the mass confusion that seems to exist among the lower courts.</blockquote>The US government intervened on behalf of Gross, arguing that the Court should decide the case on narrow grounds: &quot;I think both on a substantive level and a procedural level Desert Palace largely resolves this case.&quot;
