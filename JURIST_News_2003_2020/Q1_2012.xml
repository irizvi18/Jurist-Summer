The contentious legislation contains a clause that allows the president to use "all necessary and appropriate force" to detain persons suspected of terrorism. Obama stated that while he supports the bill as a whole, he does not agree with everything in it, specifically the provisions regulating the detention, interrogation and prosecution of suspected terrorists. Obama indicated that his administration's success against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive] and affiliated terrorist organizations was based on flexibility which allows counterterrorism professionals to adapt to changing circumstances and utilize a broad range of practices to protect the American public. According to Obama, his administration will interpret and implement the controversial provisions in a manner which will provide the maximum measure of flexibility. Specifically, Obama noted that his administration will interpret the section requiring military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees as allowing the executive branch to waive the military custody requirement when it would be in the best interest of national security. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-law">vigorously chastised the President</a> [statement] stating that the statute is dangerous due to its lack of temporal or geographic limitations, and due to the fact that it could be used in the future to detain individuals captured "far from any battlefield." 

<p>Both houses of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/congress-reaches-agreement-on-controversial-defense-bill.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on the language of the NDAA's most controversial sections in mid-December. Earlier in December, the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] a provision in the NDAA that gives the military complete control and custody over terror suspects. Shortly before the SASC's decision, the ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/acalltocourage.pdf">issued a report</a> [pdf] claiming that the US is <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="/feature/2011/09/9-11.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. To support this contention, the report cites to US policies regarding indefinite military detention for terrorism suspects, the use of torture on terrorism suspects and enemy combatants, racial and religious profiling and domestic surveillance and wiretapping. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Roberts' comments came amid controversy over whether two justices on the Court should <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/PAWIC/APUSnews/Article_2011-12-31-Supreme%20Court-Year%20End/id-856f3ac1536a4fb9aee07f4299228404">recuse themselves</a> [AP report] when the Supreme Court decides the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/12/a-defense-of-justices-ethics/#more-135649">constitutionality</a> [SCOTUS blog] of <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] this term. Republicans have called on Justice Elena Kagan to step off the case based on her work as solicitor general under the Obama administration while Democrats insist that Justice Clarence Thomas not participate in the case due to his wife's work with various groups opposing this health care reform. Lawmakers criticize the US Supreme Court's ethical practices for employing less strict ethical standards than other federal courts. Though not directly mentioning the health care case, Roberts states in the report: <blockquote>I have complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted. They are jurists of exceptional integrity and experience whose character and fitness have been examined through a rigorous appointment and confirmation process. I know that they each give careful consideration to any recusal questions that arise in the course of their judicial duties. We are all deeply committed to the common interest in preserving the Court's vital role as an impartial tribunal governed by the rule of law. </blockquote> The Court is expected to rule on the constitutionality of the PPACA by the end of June.

<p>In November, the Supreme Court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">hear arguments</a> [JURIST report] on the constitutionality of the PPACA. The court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111411zor.pdf">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in three separate cases, reserving five-and-half-hours for oral argument on the issue. The court agreed to hear two hours of arguments on the constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate issue in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-398.htm">Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida</a> [docket]. The court will consider Issue 1, which asks, "whether Congress had the power under Article I of the Constitution to enact the minimum coverage provision." The court consolidated the cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-393.htm">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [docket] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-400.htm">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [docket] and will hear 90 minutes of oral argument on the question of whether the individual mandate provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. All three cases that the court agreed to hear arose out of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled in August that the individual mandate is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional but severable</a> [JURIST report], upholding the rest of the law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The government's response came amid <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/01/us-egypt-rights-idUSTRE8000DF20120101?feedType=RSS&feedName=everything&virtualBrandChannel=11563">accusations</a> [Reuters report] by various human rights groups that Egypt was trying to silence the military council's vocal opposition. Allegations against the Egyptian government for their treatment of the opposition came after Egypt raided the offices of 17 different NGOs last week. Authorities state that the raid was part of an investigation of illegal political funding activities. The US expressed that they may reconsider the $1.3 billion in military aid given to Egypt annually if the raids against NGOs do not stop. Responding to criticism, the Egyptian government on Friday agreed to cease its <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-state-department-egypt-to-halt-raids-on-pro-democracy-groups.php">crackdowns</a> [JURIST report] on NGOs that advocate for democracy in Egypt, according to the US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website]. Egyptian officials <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16370561">assured the US</a> [BBC report] that it would return all property and assets seized in the raids to the NGOs. 

<p>Despite Egypt's assurances the US said that the raids on NGOs did not positively reflect the Egyptian government's commitment to democracy. The raids resulted from concerns by the Egyptian government over how the pro-democracy NGOs were funded. Egypt's military proclaimed that it would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/29/us-egypt-groups-idUSTRE7BS0PT20111229">not tolerate foreign interference</a> [Reuters report] in the nation's affairs. The US hinted that the raids may induce increased scrutiny over the $1.3 billion in military aid that the US sends to Egypt annually. Egyptian crackdowns against protesters have drawn significant criticism recently. On Thursday, Egyptian prosecutors and police raided the offices of 17 pro-democracy groups. Two weeks ago, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-egypt-military-crackdown.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a brutal suppression of protesters that led to 11 deaths and over 500 injuries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The presidential order <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_MYANMAR_CLEMENCY?SITE=NCBER&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">commuted death sentences to life imprisonment</a> [AP report], reduced sentences of over 30 years to 30 years, those between 20 and 30 years were reduced to 20 years, and sentences of fewer than 20 years were cut by one-fourth. The announcement fell short of the anticipated clemency for political dissidents, as urged in an <a href="http://www.myanmar.com/newspaper/nlm/Nov13_04.html">open letter</a> [text] published by the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission (MNHRC). Myanmar's government <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Asia/Story/A1Story20120102-319507.html">proclaimed</a> [AFP report] that the clemency order was issued on the grounds of national solidarity and humanitarianism. It remains to be seen whether or not political prisoners are included within the scope of the clemency order. Releases are expected to begin Tuesday.

<p>Myanmar's nominally civilian government has implemented numerous political reforms since winning the first elections held in 20 years in March 2011. Earlier in December, the government <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/myanmar-president-approves-peaceful-protest-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would give citizens the right to conduct peaceful protests, provided that they receive prior governmental authorization. In October, Sein <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/myanmar-urged-to-release-remaining-political-prisoners.php">released over 200 political prisoners</a> [JURIST report]. In September, Myanmar's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/myanmar-government-forms-human-rights-commission.php">created the MNHRC</a> [JURIST report] to safeguard citizens' constitutional rights.

The announcement was <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/cautious-relief-as-fiji-takes-steps-towards-democracy-20120102-1pidu.html">cautiously welcomed by longtime regional critics</a> [<em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> report], Australia and New Zealand. Local opposition politicians and critics &#8212; often victims of harsh censorship regulations &#8212; have <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i6KLakVE8EURLhwHHiBdYD7Ts-bA?docId=CNG.dd7871b47f818f3295303a270e3b7dc4.11">not yet commented</a> [AFP report].  <a href="http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2012/01/02/fiji-announces-lifting-of-state-of-emergency/">Skepticism remains about military involvement</a> [VOA report] in the election process Bainimarama promised to hold in 2014.  Although the Commodore did not indicate what laws would replace the emergency laws enforced through <a href="http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=47&Itemid=158">Public Emergency Regulations</a> (PER) [text, PDF], he warned "public order, protecting the vulnerable and safeguarding the economy will always be paramount." Bainimarama also indicated:<blockquote>There are certain features of the new constitution that will be non-negotiable. The constitution must establish a government that is founded on an electoral system that guarantees equal suffrage - a truly democratic system based on the principle of one person, one vote, one value; We will not have a system that will classify Fijians based on ethnicity; and, Our young men and women, those 18 years old must have the right to vote.</blockquote>It remains unclear what effect, if any, lifting the PER &#8212; which requires official approval for meetings of more than three people &#8212; will have on the military government's <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/fiji-acts-to-ease-draconian-rule/story-e6frg6so-1226235099540">Media Decree</a> [<em>The Australian</em> report; <a href="http://www.fijilive.com/archive/showpdf.php?pdf=2010/04/DRAFT%20COPYMedia%20Industry%20Development%20Decree%202010.pdf">text</a>, PDF].

<p>Fiji's military government has faced increasing international criticism since Bainimarama came to power in a <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/fijian-military-carries-out-coup.php">bloodless coup in 2006</a> [JURIST report]. In October 2010, Mahendra Chaudry, a former prime minister who lost power in a coup in 2000, and the current opposition leader, <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/fiji-ex-pm-detained-for-violating-law-against-public-meetings.php">were arrested by military authorities</a> [JURIST report] for allegedly holding public meetings in violation of the PER. In April 2010, international rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rights-groups-concerned-over-fiji-draft.php">voiced concern about the Media Decree</a> [JURIST report] the Fijian government later approved, which provides for significant fines, up to five years' imprisonment of journalists, and requires registration and local ownership of mass media entities. In September 2009, the Commonwealth of Nations <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/fiji-suspended-from-commonwealth-for.php">suspended Fiji</a> [JURIST report] from its organization because it failed to meet the deadline for reinstating a constitutional democracy and opening a national dialogue. In July 2009, Bainimarama <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/fiji-pm-announces-plan-for-new.php">announced plans to establish a new constitution by September 2013</a> [JURIST report] prior to the elections planned for September 2014.

California became the first state to require public schools to teach the <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/CARIE/7f780b0f92634e54be4b48f9179deaa4/Article_2011-12-31-New%20Laws-California/id-c1ad05fed60b44e3b8ca8800ea64963b">positive contributions of gays and lesbians</a> [AP report], and added individuals with disabilities to the list of people whose contributions are to be included in California and US history lessons. In addition, the first part of the California Dream Act took effect on Sunday which allows students who entered the country illegally as children to obtain private financial aid to attend public colleges in California. The second part of the act, set to take effect on January 1, 2013, will allow illegal immigrants to obtain state funded aid to attend state universities. In contrast, a new <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/ALDEC/TDNational/Article_2012-01-01-SC-New%20Laws/id-112ba8c8e0224b8098022e515c083f98">South Carolina law</a> [AP report] will require employers to first consult a federal database before hiring employees to ensure that workers are in the country legally. Laws allowing same-sex couples to <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/ktla-more-states-allow-same-sex-civil-unions,0,4860398.story">enter into civil unions</a> [<em>Baltimore Sun</em> report] also took effect in Delaware and Hawaii.

<p>In Alabama, a tough <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2011-12-28-New%20Laws/id-313536fa9b6440cc89ae8b8e49ce2b3f">immigration law</a> [AP report] requires all employees doing business with a government entity to use the E-Verify federal system to check the eligibility of all employees in the country. A similar law in Georgia took effect to require business with 500 or more employees to use E-Verify to ensure all employees are legally in the country. In New Hampshire, a law took effect requiring girls to tell their parents or a judge before getting an abortion. A new Oregon law eliminated the employment related exemption for the <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/OREUG/a8dbce6f2a1f4e5d90c2a9e13af098c3/Article_2012-01-01-New%20Laws/id-f70c1dab838e42c3b6d58e98de4e8f49">ban on cell phones</a> [AP report] while driving. The exemption in place permitted the use of cell phones if the device was necessary for employment purposes. Also, a new Oregon law increases the penalty for driving under the influence, making even first time offenses more costly. Washington has a new <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/ALDEC/TDNational/Article_2011-12-31-New%20Laws/id-ccc4858c40dc4e92b6c42ee29d794b03">campaign finance law</a> [AP report] that makes it more difficult to obscure the source of funding for political campaigns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A gala was being held to celebrate the new constitution, which the protesters <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2012/01/02/3349209/thousands-protest-over-new-hungarian.html">condemned as hypocritical</a> [AP report]. Opponents have criticized the constitution as giving the government too much power over the media, economy and religion in violation of international human rights laws. They claim that the new constitution, passed by two-thirds of the <a href="http://www.mkogy.hu/parl_en.htm">Parliament</a> [official website], has eroded the country's democratic checks and balances. The Hungarian government responded that the new constitution, passed in April, was long overdue and embodies national and European values.  

<p>Hungary's controversial news laws have been the source of much criticism over the past year. In December Hungary's <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/hungary-court-strikes-down-provisions-of-media-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] certain provisions of the country's recently passed media law as an unconstitutional restraint on press freedom. The court also struck down a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hungary-urged-to-revoke-church-law.php">regulating religious organizations</a> [JURIST report]. In April Hungarian President Pal Schmitt <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law-amid-rights-concerns.php">signed into law the new constitution</a> [JURIST report] amid concern from civil society leaders and opposition politicians that the document contravenes European human rights principles. According to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], the new constitution "enshrines discrimination" and jeopardizes the rights of people with disabilities, women and LGBT people. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The contentious <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/israeli-lawmakers-advance-legislation-that-critics-say-undermines-judiciarys-independence/2012/01/03/gIQANYsZXP_story.html">law has been criticized</a> [AP report] for undermining the independence of the judiciary in an effort to further a conservative judge favored by the government. Under the old law, Supreme Court Justice Asher Grunis <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/knesset-approves-controversial-grunis-bill-1.405139?localLinksEnabled=false">would have been precluded</a> [Haaretz report] from standing for chief justice because requirements that the chief justice be able to serve for three years before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. The new law changes that to two years and would allow Grunis to become chief justice. Critics also claim that a separate bill passed by a legislative panel would allow lawmakers to stack the Supreme Court judicial selection committee. Many fear the new laws will influence judicial decisions, impede upon the rights of the press and be used to harass liberal groups.  

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/israel-cabinet-backs-bill-restricting.php">power of the Israel Supreme Court was restricted</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 when a bill was passed granting the Knesset authority to revise laws overturned by the court. The controversial measure, <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/israel-justice-minister-supports.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 by Israeli Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann provided the first statutory guide on the Supreme Court's annulment power. That power was interpreted to reach all Knesset-passed measures deemed to contravene one of the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/description/eng/eng_mimshal_yesod1.htm">Basic Laws</a> [text], the bill reduced that scope to allow Supreme Court annulment only of those laws contravening the <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic3_eng.htm">Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty</a> and <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic4_eng.htm">Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation</a> [text]. The proposal also granted the Knesset authority to revise laws overturned by the Supreme Court, thereby renewing those laws' validity. In those cases, the Knesset could overturn a Supreme Court ruling with an ordinary one-round of voting rather than the 61-vote majority in the 120-member body in three rounds of voting currently required to overturn the Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Faezeh Hashemi, who is a former member of Iran's <a href="http://www.majlis.ir/">Parliament</a> [official website, in Persian], is also <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/03/iran-former-president-daughter-jailed-hashimi?newsfeed=true">forbidden from being a member of any political party</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and must refrain from any "media or online activities" for five years. Hashemi's conviction stems from her <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16392121">activities during and after the 2009 Iran elections</a> [BBC report] in which she supported the candidate opposing current Iranian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-10866448">President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a> [BBC profile] and participated in protests contesting the election results. In an <a href="http://www.roozonline.com/english/interview/interview/archive/2011/april/26/article/the-country-is-in-the-hands-of-thugs.html">interview</a> [text] Hashemi gave to Roozonline, she accused supporters of the current Iranian government of harassing her. The interview is believed to have been what prompted the current regime to impose the six-month prison sentence. Hashemi has 20 days to appeal her sentence.

<p>Hashemi is one of several opposition figures that have been detained and charged in connection with the wave of civil unrest following the disputed re-election of Ahmadinejad. Last week Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/Iran-court-sentences-opposition-leader-to-8-years-in-prison.php">sentenced opposition figure</a> [JURIST report] and former Iranian foreign minister Ebrahim Yazdi to eight years in prison for attempting to act against national security. Yazdi was also banned from civic activities for five years in the closed-door trial reportedly held in early November. In August Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi said that approximately 100 people imprisoned for their participation in the massive 2009 presidential election protests have been <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/iran-election-protesters-released-from-prisons.php">pardoned and released</a> [JURIST report] by Iran's supreme leader <a href="http://www.leader.ir/langs/EN/index.php?p=bio/">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a> [official profile]. In March Iranian opposition leaders <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8103851.stm">Mir-Hossein Mousavi</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mir-Hossein+Mousavi">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/k/mehdi_karroubi/index.html">Mehdi Karroubi</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mehdi+Karroubi">news archive</a>] and their wives were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/iran-opposition-leaders-jailed-reports.php">arrested and jailed</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mubarak is facing charges of complicity by ordering the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">killings of at least 840 protesters</a> [JURIST report] during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">Egyptian revolution</a> [JURIST news archive] early last year after which Mubarak <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">stepped down from the office</a> [JURIST report]. Tuesday's session, which lasted 90 minutes, was the first of three sessions in which the prosecution will present its case to the court. The head of the prosecutor team, Mustapha Suleiman, <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE80204F20120103?sp=true">delivered the opening statement</a> [Reuters report] which did not deal with the charge against Mubarak of ordering the killings of the protesters. The session was adjourned by the presiding judge, Ahmed Refaat, until Wednesday when another member of the prosecution was to present the case. Along with Mubarak, his two sons, Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, the former interior minister and senior police officers are also facing charges of corruption and involvement in the killings of the protesters.

<p>Mubarak's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">started in August</a> [JURIST report] and has been making slow progress. The trial was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/egypt-court-resumes-mubarak-trial.php">resumed</a> last week by the Egyptian court after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-adjourns-mubarak-trial-until-december.php">two-month adjournment</a> [JURIST reports] which allowed the court time to rule on a motion made by lawyers representing the victims' families to have the three-judge panel in the case removed. The victims' families argued that were not given enough time to question the Field Marshal <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/egypt/tantawi.htm">Mohamed Hussein Tantawi</a> [GlobalSecurity profile], head of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder], who <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mubarak-trial-suspended-after-former-ally-testifies.php">testified against Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] in a closed session in September, but left early and refused to be cross-examined by counsel of the victims.

The trial will focus on who ordered snipers to kill 41 protesters during last year's Tunisian revolution which resulted in the death of more than 200 protesters. Along with Ben Ali, numerous former senior officials were named as defendants in this trial. Among them was the former director general of public security, Lotfi Zwawi, who  on Monday denied any knowledge of the death of the protesters. The former Tunisian president and his wife have been already <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-sentenced-to-35-years-in-absentia.php">sentenced to 35 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] and fined USD $65.6 million in June after the court found them guilty <em>in absentia</em> of theft and unlawful possession of money and jewelry. The ruling came hours after the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/trial-of-tunisia-ex-president-ben-ali-begins-in-absentia.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] for charges including murder and conspiracy to trafficking and drug use. The ex-president <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/former-tunisia-president-denies-allegations-before-trial.php">has denied</a> [JURIST report] the numerous charges. He <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/tunisia-constitutional-council-announces-interim-president-new-elections.php">left the office</a> [JURIST report] and the country in January to Saudi Arabia during the protests. But Ben Ali, through his attorney, stated that he left because <a href="http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2011/June/middleeast_June561.xml&section=middleeast&col=">he was "duped" into leaving</a> [AFP report] the capital Tunis.

The announcement came after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy websites] urged Tunisia to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/rights-group-urges-investigation-into-tunisia-protester-abuses.php">investigate</a> [JURIST report] the allegations of brutality against protesters and to end such <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/hrw-calls-for-end-to-police-violence-in-tunisia-protests.php">police violence</a> [JURIST report].

Evren was head of the 1980 military coup before he became Turkey's president in 1982 and was first <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/en/component/content/article/111-alt-manset-haberleri-en/84610-prosecutors-ask-12-questions-to-coup-leader-kenan-evren">questioned by authorities</a> [AA report] in June after the Turkish constitution was amended in 2010 in order to remove coup leaders' immunity. Evren and Sahinkaya are the only <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=8732700&c=EUR&s=TOP">two generals alive out of the five men</a> [AFP report] who are believed to have planned the 1980 military coup. The court must decide within 15 days whether it will accept the indictment and hold a trial or dismiss it.

<p>In November, the trial began for a different coup plot for 13 Turkish journalists who were accused of <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/turkish-journalists-on-trial-for-alleged-coup-plot.php">formulating a plan</a> [JURIST report] to overthrow the Islamic government in Turkey. In August, a Turkish court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/turkish-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-seven-military-officers.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for seven generals and admirals accused of creating anti-government websites in 2009. A number of other senior military officials are in detention for a separate investigation of the Balyoz Security Operation Plan (also known as "Operation Sledgehammer"), a military plot to overthrow the Islamic-rooted government. The "Sledgehammer" plot is similar to the Ergenekon conspiracy. The Ergenekon group is alleged to be involved in bombings, political assassination plots and the death of journalist Hrant Dink. The probe into the Ergenekon conspiracy has been criticized as an attempt by the AKP to silence opposition and further its <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">imposition of Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report] in violation of Turkey's secular constitution. <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">Trials against the Ergenekon group</a> [JURIST report] opened over two years ago with more than 200 suspects in custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The USD $18 billion fine, one of the largest in the history of environmental contamination suits, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">originally set at $8.6 billion</a> [JURIST report] but was more than doubled for Chevron's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-16404268">refusal to pay "moral reparations"</a> [BBC report] to the Ecuadorian government, as <a href="http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2012/01/04/229367.htm">required by the original ruling</a> [Reuters report]. As Chevron officials <a href="http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/01032012_chevroncondemnsillegitimatedecisionbyecuadorappellatecourt.news">condemn</a> [press release] the decision as fraudulent, unenforceable and corrupted by the politicization of Ecuador's judiciary, the corporation is pursuing private recourse through <a href="http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=363">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website] in The Hague. The corporation is also <a href="http://www.chevron.com/chevron/pressreleases/article/12212011_chevroncallsforcriminalinvestigationofjudgeplaintiffslawyersinecuadorcase.news">calling for a criminal investigation</a> [press release] into the judge and plaintiffs' lawyers in the case. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.texacotoxico.org/eng/">Amazon Defense Coalition</a> [advocacy website], plaintiffs in the suit, have responded that the judgment is a reaffirmation of how Chevron's <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/01/03/4160619/amazon-defense-coalition-ecuador.html">greed and criminal misconduct</a> [press release] in dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into the river has led to death and disease.

<p>Damages were initially awarded in February by the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios which found that Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, polluted large areas of the country's rain forest. That month, Chevron filed a US lawsuit against plaintiffs' lawyers and consultants in the case, claiming that plaintiffs were attempting to extort Chevron. The damages were then <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/federal-judge-blocks-damages-in-chevron-pollution-case.php">enjoined</a> by a New York in March, but the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-damages-against-chevron-for-ecuador-oil-spill.php">injunction was later overturned</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website]. In July, the Second Circuit <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/16/entertainment/la-et-crude-20100716">upheld</a> [LAT report] a <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/06/judge-rules-that-filmmaker-must-give-footage-to-chevron/">May ruling</a> [NYT report] by the Southern District of New York ordering filmmaker Joe Berlinger to turn over to Chevron certain outtakes from his <a href="http://www.crudethemovie.com/">2009 documentary Crude</a> [film website]. Chevron claims the outtakes show plaintiffs' lawyers discussing illegal and unethical tactics, including ghost-writing a court appointed expert's report, intimidating a judge and colluding with government officials. Chevron claims that a 1995 cleanup agreement between Ecuador and Texaco, completed in 1998 at a cost of $40 million, absolves Chevron of all liability.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the first step taken by the NTC in establishing a new democratic government after the fall of the 42-year dictator. The interim government faces several challenges including <a href="http://mg.co.za/article/2012-01-04-plans-set-for-vote-on-libya-assembly-to-draft-new-constitution/">addressing and reconciling</a> [<em>Mail &#38; Guardian</em> report] with the significant portion of Libyans involved in Gaddafi's regime and those who fought in regional militias and revolutionary groups.

<p>The NTC has been gaining recognition among other countries, as well as the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/world-bank-recognizes-new-libya-regime-as-it-vows-to-investigate-rights-abuses.php">World Bank</a> [JURIST report].

Under the <a href="http://www.elpais.com/elpaismedia/ultimahora/media/201201/02/cultura/20120102elpepucul_1_Pes_PDF.pdf">Sinde law</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish], the new government agency will <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16391727">take claims of infringement</a> [BBC report] against websites that have copyrighted material and will then determine whether to take action against the site. If the commission decides to take action, the legislation then provides that the case be referred to a judge who will make the final decision on whether the site should be shut down. Those opposing the new legislation argue that the law erodes the basic freedom of expression. The legislation was passed by the new ruling <a href="http://www.pp.es/">Partido Popular</a> [party website, in Spanish] as one of its first acts since it came to power in November. The bill was originally considered by the prior government under Socialist rule, but was put on hold to be decided on later.

<p>With the passage of the Sinde law, Spain joins other countries that have taken a strong stance against piracy. The US Congress is currently considering a similar bill known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3261:">SOPA</a> [materials]. In July, the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/uk-court-allows-blocking-of-file-sharing-site.php">UK allowed the blocking of a file-sharing site</a> [JURIST report]. The UK's High Court of Justice ruled for the Motion Picture Association (MPAA), requiring Internet provider British Telecom (BT) to block access to a file-sharing website, Newzbin2. The British Department for Business Innovation and Skills in 2009 proposed stricter sanctions against illegal file-sharing that would include restricting and suspending user Internet access. This eventually became the Digital Economy Act passed in 2010. It is currently under judicial review. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The court determined that the plan, which is nearly identical to the 1991 plan but for the movement of one county, focused too heavily on preserving old boundaries as opposed to equal population distribution. In his decision, Judge Robert Bruce King stated that "change is the essence of the apportionment process," and that it is necessary to address population changes in the plan in order to afford equal voting power to the citizens of West Virginia. The legislature has been given until January 17 to create a new plan. 

<p>Texas has also faced challenges to its redistricting plans. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="httphttp://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/120911zr.pdf://">agreed</a> [order list, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-texas-redistricting-plan.php">rule on three Texas redistricting plans</a> [JURIST report]. The emergency appeal challenges an interim map drawn up by the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> while a separate map drawn up by the state legislature is currently being challenged in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official websites] for compliance with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].

If the legislation is passed, Washington would be the seventh state in the nation to legalize gay marriage, including <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">Washington, DC</a> [JURIST reports]. Gregoire <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/speeches/speech-view.asp?SpeechSeq=222">spoke</a> [transcript] about the many reasons that she is advancing this legislation:<blockquote>For all couples, a marriage license is very important. It gives them the right to enter into a marriage contract in which their legal interests, and those of their children if any, are protected by well-established law. ... Our gay and lesbian families face the same hurdles as heterosexual families&#8212;making ends meet, finding time for career and family, raising their children and saving for college. </blockquote>Gregoire also equated comments that domestic partnerships being the same as marriage to the "separate but equal" discrimination arguments made in previous civil rights eras.

<p>Gregoire has been a consistent advocate for <a href="/currentawareness/gayrights.php">gay rights</a> [JURIST news archive] during her tenure as governor. In April she <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/washington-governor-signs-bill-recognizing-out-of-state-same-sex-marriages.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that recognized as legal same-sex marriage licenses from other states. In March 2007 Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/washington-governor-signs-domestic.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] that recognized domestic partnership status for same-sex couples. Same-sex marriage remains a contentious issue even after the passage of similar laws in other states. The new same-sex marriage law in New York is currently being <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/challenge-to-new-york-same-sex-marriage-act-allowed-to-proceed.php">challenged</a> [JURIST reports] in that state's court system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontabortion.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] Wednesday heard arguments in an appeal by the state of Texas to lift a lower court's <a href="http://courtweb.pamd.uscourts.gov/courtwebsearch/txwd/08342349.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF] against a <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/HB00015E.pdf#navpanes=0">state abortion law</a> [HB 15 text] that requires doctors to show sonograms to patients before performing the procedure. The three-judge panel did not immediately rule on the state's request to lift the injunction, which Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell argued should be vacated as an abuse of discretion by the lower federal court. <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website] attorney Julie Rikelman told the Fifth Circuit panel that the law exceeds the state's authority to regulate the medical profession in that the information in question is not medically necessary for the procedure. CRR had filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">challenge to the newly signed Texas law</a> on behalf of a class of physicians that perform abortions, and in August US District Judge Sam Sparks <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-key-provisions-of-texas-abortion-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST reports] that several provisions of the state law violated the free-speech rights of abortion-performing doctors. The lower court enjoined the provisions of the law requiring physicians to provide, and women to hear, descriptions of the sonogram and fetal heartbeat, holding such provisions violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], and severed three sections of the law held to be unconstitutionally vague. Rikelman noted that other courts have temporarily blocked similar laws in Oklahoma and North Carolina after her group sued, and several other states have enacted less intrusive sonogram laws that make it optional for doctors to provide descriptions to patients. Mitchell argued that the injunction should be lifted on the grounds that the state's interest in protecting fetal life through reasonable regulation trumps free-speech claims. The state wants the entire suit dismissed without trial.

<p>Texas is only one of many states that have recently enacted, and subsequently had to defend, laws restricting abortions. With courts analyzing these cases differently, the outcomes have varied. Regarding another case dealing with the intersection of state abortion laws and free speech rights, last month <a href="http://www.elon.edu/e-web/law/faculty/gaylord_scott.xhtml">Scott Gaylord</a> of Elon University School of Law <a href="/forum/2011/12/scott-gaylord-government-speech.php">wrote</a> [JURIST op-ed] that a district court applied an outdated government speech test a month earlier when it <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-north-carolina-choose-life-license-plates.php">issued an injunction</a> [JURIST report] preventing North Carolina from allowing drivers to select "Choose Life" license plates. The court in that case ruled that "by authorizing the 'Choose Life' plate without also offering a pro-choice alternative, the State has engaged in impermissible viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment." In August the <a href="http://www.apltwo.ct.state.az.us/">Arizona Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/arizona-appeals-court-lifts-injunction-on-2009-abortion-law.php">ended a two-year injunction</a> [JURIST report] on portions of a law that restricted abortion practices. The original injunction by the <a href="http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/">Maricopa County Superior Court</a> [official website] held the following provisions as "undue burdens" on a woman's right to an abortion: prohibitions on anyone but a licensed physician performing an abortion; a requirement that women meet with the doctor personally 24 hours before an abortion (the injunction held that a phone call would suffice); that medical professionals have a right to refuse to perform even medically necessary abortions, provide certain contraceptives or the "morning after" pill; and a mandate that parents' consent forms allowing their child to get an abortion be notarized. The appeals court reinstated all of these stipulations, suggesting that the lower judge had applied "strict scrutiny" in error rather than an "undue burden" test. <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppaz/">Planned Parenthood of Arizona</a> [advocacy website], a party to the original suit, said the law's enactment will have a severe impact on women in the state, many of whom have to take day-trips to have abortions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As Jerusalem's mayor from 1993 to 2003, Olmert, along with other city officials, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/05/israel-olmert-idUSL6E8C517R20120105">allegedly accepted millions of dollars in bribes</a> [Reuters report] to assure the approval of plans for Holyland, which dominates a Jerusalem hilltop and has attracted unrelenting criticism for its architecture. Specifically the 83-page indictment states that the project's developers, who also have been charged in the case, received zoning and tax breaks in return for the bribes. Olmert, already on trial over corruption accusations, has denied the latest charges. He has already pleaded not guilty in separate proceedings over allegations he took cash for favors and double-billed charities for airfare to attend overseas fundraisers while serving as a cabinet minister and mayor before he became prime minister in 2006. Olmert resigned as Israel's leader in September 2008, saying he wanted to clear his name, staying on as caretaker prime minister until March 2009 when Benjamin Netanyahu was sworn in. Olmert was officially <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/israel-ex-pm-suspected-of-corruption-in.php">named as a suspect</a> [JURIST report] in the investigation in April 2010.

<p>Olmert has been embroiled in accusations of scandal for much of his political career. He is already <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/israel-ex-pm-olmert-pleads-not-guilty.php">facing trial</a> [JURIST report], the first of a former or current Israeli prime minister, for corruption and fraud charges that led to his resignation as prime minister. He is accused of illegally <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/prosecutor-alleges-israel-pm-accepted.php">accepting cash contributions</a> from an American businessman, <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/israel-attorney-general-considering.php">double billing</a> [JURIST reports] travel expenses to the state and charitable donors, and giving his former law partner access to state information. In April 2007, Olmert was <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/israel-official-recommends-criminal.php">investigated for improperly favoring his supporters</a> [JURIST report] in distributing business grants during his time as trade minister. In January 2007, the Israeli Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/israel-pm-facing-criminal.php">announced plans to launch an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations that he promoted the interests of two business associates during the 2005 state sale of <a href="http://english.leumi.co.il/Home/0,2777,1415,00.html">Bank Leumi</a> [corporate website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2012/01/arizona_lawsuit_against_medica.php">challenge</a> [text], filed by Governor Jan Brewer, argued the law makes state officials vulnerable to federal prosecution for implementing the law. The court ruled, however, that there was no legitimate threat of prosecution for officials who simply enforce the law and dismissed the complaint based on a motion filed by the ACLU, the US Justice Department and other individuals for lack of ripeness.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/arizona-to-file-lawsuit-over-controversial-state-medical-marijuana-law.php">act was challenged</a> by Gov.

The act legalizes the possession of up to two-and-a-half ounces of medical marijuana and up to 12 cannabis plants. The medical marijuana is only allowed for individuals with any of a set list of medical conditions including cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and AIDS who have gotten a recommendation from their physician and have registered with the Arizona Department of Health Services. Arizona is the fifteenth state to legalize medical marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law labels <a href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3882843.stm">President Alexander Lukashenko</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Lukashenko">news archive</a>] a dictator and states that he "established himself in power by orchestrating an illegal and unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new constitution, abolishing the duly elected parliament." The new sanctions require the US to investigate Belarus' arms deals and its possible censorship of the Internet, as well as denying visas to a list of Belarusian officials. The bill also calls on the <a href = "http://www.iihf.com/">International Ice Hockey Federation</a> [official website] to change the location of the 2014 International World Ice Hockey Championship, currently scheduled in Minsk, which the US believes will "legitimize" the Belarusian government. The legislation was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-lawmakers-vote-to-sanction-belarus-urges-international-ice-hockey-federation-to-do-same.php">passed by Congress</a> [JURIST report] in late December.

<p>Belarus has been under increasing criticism for what many see as a rapid decline of human rights in the Eastern European nation. In November a Belarus court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/belarus-court-jails-human-rights-activist-for-tax-evasion.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the president of <a href = "http://spring96.org/en">Viasana</a> and vice-president of the <a href = "http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation for Human Rights</a> (FIDH) [advocacy websites], of tax evasion, sentencing him to a four-and-a-half-year prison term amid international criticism. In September UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] suggested a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-urges-belarus-to-release-political-prisoners.php">need for UN intervention in Belarus</a> [JURIST report] and demanded the nation free non-violent political prisoners. Her report also cited Belarus as the only European nation to still enforce the death penalty. Ambassador Mikhail Khvostov said his country disagrees with the UN on what constitutes a peaceful demonstration and that Belarus is committed to human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This announcement came on the <a href="http://tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=7622">last day to make statements to the court panel</a> [Tripoli Post report]. The defendants will present their case Monday with a decision expected by January 25. While the prosecution claims to have a strong case, Mubarak and others continue to maintain their innocence. 

<p>The trial for ex-president Mubarak has been tumultuous. It was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-adjourns-mubarak-trial-until-december.php">adjourned for all of November</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/egypt-court-resumes-mubarak-trial.php">reopened in December</a> [JURIST reports]. In September, <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mubarak-trial-resumed-amid-courtroom-violence.php">violence broke out</a> [JURIST report] in the courtroom when plaintiffs and their lawyers clashed with Mubarak supporters. In August, presiding Judge Ahmed Rifaat <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-resumes-live-tv-broadcasts-to-end.php">decided to end live TV broadcasts</a> [JURIST reports] of subsequent proceedings amid protests from the families of victims and praise from several courtroom lawyers who opposed the broadcasts. <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported that at least <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">840 people were killed</a> [JURIST report] and more than 6,000 injured during the Egyptian protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The former State Department employee, Sabrina De Sousa, brought the suit after being tried <em>in absentia</em> in 2009 in an Italian court for the alleged kidnapping of Muslim cleric Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr. De Sousa was one of 23 US officials <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/italy-judge-convicts-23-former-cia.php">convicted of the alleged kidnapping</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. In her suit, De Sousa argued that the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] should be required to grant her immunity in the case. Lawyers for the government argued that courts have no authority to interfere with its foreign policy decisions. The district court dismissed the suit stating that the question of the "plaintiff's entitlement to immunity ... is a political question that lies beyond the competence of this Court." Although the court held it was bound by law to dismiss the suit, it expressed concerns about the government's handling of the case, saying it may send a message to "civilian government employees serving this country on tours of duty abroad ... [that is] a potentially demoralizing one."

<p>In December 2010 an Italian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/italy-appeals-court-increases-sentences-of-23-former-cia-agents.php">upheld the convictions</a> [JURIST report] of 23 former CIA agents convicted in the 2003 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+Italy+Kidnapping">kidnapping and rendition</a> [JURIST news archive] of terror suspect Nasr, increasing their sentences. De Sousa's original five-year sentence was increased to seven years. Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was seized on the streets of Milan in 2003 by CIA agents with the help of Italian operatives, then allegedly transferred to Egypt and <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-claims-cia-torture-in-2003.php">tortured</a> by Egypt's State Security Intelligence before being <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/egypt-cleric-at-center-of-italy-cia.php">released</a> [JURIST reports] in February 2007. In September 2009 the DOJ filed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/doj-seeks-dismissal-of-diplomatic.php">motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the lawsuit brought by De Sousa seeking diplomatic immunity against the Italian charges. The CIA's rendition program has been the source of much controversy and litigation. In 2009 President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/obama-administration-to-continue.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the US would continue its practice of sending terror detainees to third countries for interrogation with increased oversight by the State Department to prevent torture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Melissa and Heather Gartner sued the Iowa Department of Public Health after officials refused to include the name of their child's non-biological parent on the child's birth certificate unless the non-biological parent adopted the child. The Gartners are legally married in Iowa, a state that <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">legalized gay marriage</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. The court held that because same-sex marriage is legal in the state, the Department of Public Health erred in refusing to include the name of the non-biological parent on the child's birth certificate. The court refused to require the non-biological same-sex parent to adopt the child in order to be listed on the birth certificate, and it ordered the Department of Public Health to issue a new document including the names of both parents. The Department of Public Health has the option to appeal the decision.

<p>In October  the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/the-supreme-court-has-a-big-day.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/adar-v-smith.html">Adar v. Smith</a> [backgrounder], in which a same-sex couple asked Louisiana to include both of their names on the birth certificate of their adopted child. The issue presented was whether denying non-married couples from having both names appear on an adopted child's birth certificate is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. Gay rights group <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lambda Legal</a> [advocacy website] filed the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/supreme-court-asked-to-review-putting-gay-adoptive-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">petition for writ of <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in July after the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C09/09-30036-CV2.wpd.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/fifth-circuit-strikes-order-to-put-names-of-gay-adoptive-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">report</a>] en banc against the parents in April, finding that "adoption is not a fundamental right," and that "Louisiana has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children." The appeals court ruling in April overturned a <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-orders-state-to.php">prior decision</a> [JURIST report] in February by a panel of three judges from the Fifth Circuit ordering that the revised birth certificate be issued.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The ACLU claims the law unlawfully discriminates against same-sex couples who cannot legally marry in Michigan, violating the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution:<blockquote>Because unmarried opposite-sex couples can become eligible for family benefits by marrying, and employers remain free to offer family health care benefits to any other family members, including aunts, nieces, siblings, or cousins, the only family members whom the Public Employee Domestic Partner Benefit Restriction Act bars from receiving family health care benefits are the domestic partners of lesbian and gay workers. The Act therefore imposes on gay and lesbian employees' families alone the burdens of being uninsured or underinsured: financial hardship, health-related anxiety, stress, and medical risk.</blockquote>The suit was filed on behalf of four same-sex couples in long-term committed relationships.

<p>Many states, like Michigan, are facing issues pertaining to benefits for same-sex partners. In November the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ACLU-appeals-dismissal-of-same-sex-couples-benefits-to-Montana-high-court.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] against a similar bill in Montana after the state approved a law that denied partnership benefits to same-sex couples. They argued that the new law violates of the Montana Constitution. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-arizona-same-sex-couples-insurance-benefits-temporarily.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in September that a <a href="http://www.azleg.state.az.us/legtext/44leg/2r/bills/hb2013s.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] rescinding health benefits for same-sex couples in the public sector is against the equal protection clause of the Arizona Constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt10/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt10.pdf">House Judiciary Committee Report</a> [text, PDF], the purpose of the law is to clarify federal jurisdiction statutes to avoid wasting judicial resources. The core of the JVCA's changes address jurisdiction and procedure for removal of state court claims to federal court. Among those changes, the JVCA states that inclusion of unrelated state claims does not prevent removal that is otherwise appropriate under federal question jurisdiction, and it adopts a "preponderance of the evidence" standard for determining the amount in controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction. The JVCA also codified the judicially-created "rule of unanimity," which states that all defendants who have been properly joined and served to the action must consent to the removal of the action to federal court.

<p>Some commentators support the overall purpose of the JVCA, but <a href="/forum/2011/12/arthur-hellman-jvca.php">disagree</a> [JURIST op-ed] with its specific method of attaining that purpose. First, it is difficult to superimpose new statutory procedures over existing interpretations in case law and there is additional difficulty in integrating the newly codified procedures with the many different interpretations of the existing laws in state courts. Concern has also been expressed over the fact that there were no hearings on the bill since 2005, and thus two potentially beneficial provisions were <a href="/forum/2012/01/arthur-hellman-jvca-ii.php">deleted without debate</a> [JURIST op-ed]. The first would allow a plaintiff to avoid removal based on diversity jurisdiction by stipulating that the amount in controversy is below the required amount for diversity jurisdiction. The second provision, which would abrogate derivative jurisdiction in all cases, was deleted because the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website] wants to be able to use the rule "when suits involving Federal officers and agencies are removed to Federal court." Other commentators <a href="http://www.natlawreview.com/article/president-signs-federal-courts-jurisdiction-and-venue-clarification-act-2011-law">point out</a> [National Law Review report] that "while the Act does not eliminate the prior law's provision that the 30-day removal period is triggered by service or 'receipt' of the pleading, there is no indication that Congress intended to abrogate [the current practice], holding that formal service, not mere receipt, is required."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law creates several tiers of limitations on the Internet. Anyone who owns a shared connection, or a CyberCafe, must monitor all users to insure that they do not visit a "blacklisted" site, or, in some cases, simply a site hosted off of Belarus servers. Users are required to identify themselves, and the owners of shared connections must keep a surfing history of each user for at least a year. Violations of any of these provisions may result in fines. The State Inspection on Electronic Communications, a subsidiary of the <a href = "http://www.mpt.gov.by/en/">Ministry of Communications and Informatization</a> [official website] will issue the blacklist, which thus far includes pornography, websites that advocate violence or extremism, opposition group websites and some Belarusian news organizations. The law largely deals with the fines and penalties for those designated to monitor networks and is ambiguous on what will be done to users who manage to see restricted material. <a href = "http://en.rsf.org">Reporters without Borders</a> [advocacy website] <a href = "http://en.rsf.org/belarus-belarus-authorities-turn-up-the-06-01-2012,41634.html">condemned</a> [press release] the new law, describing it as, "a survival reflex on the part of a government weakened by the unrest that followed President Lukashenko's disputed re-election."

<p>Belarus has been under increasing criticism for what many see as a rapid decline of human rights in the Eastern European nation. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/barackobama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/obama-signs-new-sanctions-against-belarus-into-law.php">signed the Belarus Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2011</a> [JURIST report], which will impose new sanctions on Belarus. The new sanctions require the US to investigate Belarus' arms deals and its possible censorship of the Internet, as well as denying visas to a list of Belarusian officials. In November a Belarus court <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/belarus-court-jails-human-rights-activist-for-tax-evasion.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] human rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the president of <a href = "http://spring96.org/en">Viasana</a> and vice-president of the <a href = "http://www.fidh.org/-english-">International Federation for Human Rights</a> (FIDH) [advocacy websites], of tax evasion, sentencing him to a four-and-a-half-year prison term amid international criticism. In September UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] suggested a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/un-rights-chief-urges-belarus-to-release-political-prisoners.php">need for UN intervention in Belarus</a> [JURIST report] and demanded the nation free non-violent political prisoners. Her report also cited Belarus as the only European nation to still enforce the death penalty. Ambassador Mikhail Khvostov said his country disagrees with the UN on what constitutes a peaceful demonstration and that Belarus is committed to human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>FBI updates rape definition to include men</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfbi.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href = "http://www.fbi.gov">FBI</a> (FBI) and the US <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official websites] announced an official update of the federal government's <a href = "http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/attorney-general-eric-holder-announces-revisions-to-the-uniform-crime-reports-definition-of-rape">definition of rape</a> [press release] to include the violation of "any person" rather than the previous definition that only covered women. The previous definition had been unchanged for 85 years. The new definition, "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim," is primarily used in the <a href = "http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr">Uniform Crime Reports</a> (UCR) [materials], an annual statistical analysis of crimes in the US. Before this year, any rape of a man was not included in the US government's official rape statistical reports. This crime, not only under-reported, has thus also been under-represented statistically as well. Other updates are implied in this new definition with the inclusion of a consent provision:<blockquote>The revised definition includes any gender of victim or perpetrator, and includes instances in which the victim is incapable of giving consent because of temporary or permanent mental or physical incapacity, including due to the influence of drugs or alcohol or because of age. The ability of the victim to give consent must be determined in accordance with state statute. Physical resistance from the victim is not required to demonstrate lack of consent. The new definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the local level.</blockquote>The previous definition was simply "carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will."

<p>Last month, the FBI announced that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/fbi-reports-decrease-in-violent-crime-for-2011.php">violent crime in the US has dropped</a> [JURIST report], continuing a trend lasting for the past four-and-a-half years. Violent crimes, which include murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault, dropped 6.4 percent in the first months of 2011 compared to the same time in 2010. Property crimes, including burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft, dropped 3.7 percent and arson decreased 8.6 percent. The FBI data is a compilation of more than 18,000 jurisdictions that voluntarily participate in the FBI's UCR Program. However, with the amended definition of rape, non-forcible rapes and rapes of men will now be included in the statistical analysis, so the violent crime rate next year should reflect that shift.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontturkeyflag.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Retired Turkish general Ilker Basbug, formerly the leader of all of Turkey's armed forces, was arrested on Friday for his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] network. The group allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. Basbug is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16436743">highest ranking military officer to be indicted</a> [BBC report] in connection with Ergenekon. Approximately 400 individuals are currently on trial in connection with Ergenekon. Basbug claims that he is innocent and lower-ranking military officials who have been indicted state that they were just acting within the chain of command. Critics of the Islam-rooted AKP ruling party contend that the Ergenekon investigation is intended to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">silence the party's opponents and impose Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report], but the government denies any such charges.

<p>In March 2010 the Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-authorities-charge-33-for.php">indicted 33 defendants</a> [JURIST report] on charges of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule, and Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-arrests-20-more-in.php">detained 20 people</a> [JURIST report]  in connection with the Ergenekon plot. Turkish <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-general-prosecutor-charged-over.php">prosecutors charged</a> [JURIST report] an army general and a state prosecutor with belonging to Ergenekon and plotting to overthrow the AKP. In February of that year more than 40 military officers were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">arrested and charged in a separate coup attempt</a> [JURIST report], the so-called <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/02/201022516176575355.html">Sledgehammer plot</a> [Al Jazeera backgrounder], to provoke a military confrontation with Greece and take advantage of the ensuing chaos. Trials against the Ergenekon group <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">started</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008, and nearly 400 people have been charged in connection with it.

The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/tunisian-and-international-rights-groups-oppose-extradition-of-former-libyan-prime-minister/2012/01/06/gIQAo2wKfP_story.html">statement</a> [AP report] urges Tunisian <a href="http://www.moncefmarzouki.com/">President Moncef Marzouki</a> [official website, in Arabic] to seek guarantees from the Libyan government that al-Mahmoudi will be kept safe and will receive a fair trial, and not to sign the extradition order in the absence of those guarantees. Reports indicate that al-Mahmoudi <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">fears for his safety</a> and claims to be the sole possessor of Libyan state secrets following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-pm-confirms-muammar-gaddafi-killed-by-opposition-fighters.php">death</a> [JURIST reports] of ousted Libyan leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] in October. Some commentators have argued that African tyrants should be <a href="/forum/2011/09/charles-adeogun-phillips-libya.php">tried in their home countries</a> [JURIST op-ed].

<p>In November a Tunisian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-court-orders-extradition-of-former-libya-pm.php">ordered al-Mahmoudi's extradition</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/hrw-warns-against-extradition-of-former-libya-pm.php">HRW issued a statement</a> [JURIST reports] urging Tunisia not to carry out the extradition.  Al-Mahmoudi's extradition is the latest legal episode in an ongoing effort by Libyan and international courts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">investigate officials in Gaddafi's government</a> [JURIST report].

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthealthcare.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The federal government filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/US-brief-1-6-12-on-ACA-mandate.pdf">brief</a> [text, PDF] on Friday before the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] arguing that the minimum coverage provision of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [HR 3590; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>], which requires almost every US citizen to obtain health insurance by 2014 or face a tax penalty, is constitutional. The government is attempting to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/01/health-care-debate-reopens/#more-136085">keep the focus of the argument on health care reform as a whole</a> [SCOTUSblog report], rather than on the specific minimum coverage provision. Twenty-six states filed a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/states-brief-on-sev.-1-6-12.pdf">supporting brief</a> [text, PDF] arguing that the minimum coverage provision cannot be severed from the health care reform act without the entire system collapsing. The federal government argues that the insurance-purchase mandate is not a new concept invented by the Left and even points to the fact that several conservative groups, including the <a href="http://www.aei.org/">American Enterprise Institute</a> and the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">Heritage Foundation</a> [advocacy websites], proposed such a solution when then-president Bill Clinton proposed health care reform in the 1990s. Critics of the minimum coverage provision argue that there would be no end to government power if the federal government can impose tax penalties for declining to purchase a private corporate product. The so-called <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2011/11/18/obamacare-judges-must-answer-the-broccoli-question/">"broccoli question"</a> [Forbes report] asks: if the federal government can penalize you for not purchasing health insurance, can it then also penalize you for not purchasing broccoli? In response, the government has argued that its power to impose tax penalties for not purchasing health insurance is rooted firmly in the government's commerce-regulating power under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. The government cited the fact that in 2008 uninsured individuals used $116 billion in healthcare services (37 percent of which was uncompensated and 26 percent of which was paid by charities and government programs) and visited hospitals 2.1 million times. The uncompensated 37 percent of the health care services used, $43 billion, is then passed onto insured individuals, costing the average insured family more than $1000 per year. The federal government argues that this national cost-shifting mechanism implicates interstate commerce, thus it has the power to regulate it.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> to rule on health care reform law</a> [JURIST report] in three separate cases, reserving five-and-half-hours for oral argument on the issue. The court agreed to hear two hours of arguments on the constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate issue in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-398.htm">Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-398%20Cert%20Petititon.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. The court will consider Issue 1, which asks, "whether Congress had the power under Article I of the Constitution to enact the minimum coverage provision." The court also directed parties to brief and argue the question of whether the challenge to PPACA is barred by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [26 USC &#167; 7421(a)], reserving one hour for argument on that issue. The court consolidated the cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-393.htm">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-393%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-400.htm">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-400%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and will hear 90 minutes of oral argument on the question of whether the individual mandate provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. Finally, the court will hear one hour of oral argument on the question of Medicaid expansion&#8212;Issue 1 in <span class="casename">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>: "Does Congress exceed its enumerated powers and violate basic principles of federalism when it coerces States into accepting onerous conditions that it could not impose directly by threatening to withhold all federal funding under the single largest grant-in-aid program...?" All three cases that the court agreed to hear arose out of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled in August that the individual mandate is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional but severable</a> [JURIST report], upholding the rest of the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The commission <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hpglPJs4-hY-16cZ1rHs6IsQHW6g?docId=039aeb61fdb840f1a2a53f6587f323fc">called for the transfer of all prisoners</a> [AP report] held by the US military to Afghan custody. The <a href="/currentawareness/detainees.php">detainees</a> [JURIST news archive] held by US forces are a combination of Afghan nationals and foreign al Qaeda operatives. The commission also alleged that some prisoners are being held without evidence and called for their release. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/karzai-announces-commission-to-review-cases-of-all-suspected-taliban-militants-in-custody.php">commission was created</a> [JURIST report] by Afghan <a href="http://www.president.gov.af/index_eng.aspx">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=karzai">news archive</a>] in June 2010.

<p>The status of the detainees held by the US has also been an issue at controversy in the American courts. In February 2011 District Judge John Bates of the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-grants-motion-for-Bagram-detainees-to-amend-habeas-petitions.php">granted a motion to amend</a> [JURIST report] petitions for writs of <em>habeas corpus</em> for four detainees held at <a href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">Bagram Air Base</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bagram">news archive</a>]. In May 2010 a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that detainees held at Bagram Air Base <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/04/federal-judge-lets-afghanistan.php">cannot bring <em>habeas corpus</em> challenges in US courts</a> [JURIST report]. In January 2010 the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/us-releases-names-of-bagram-detainees.php">released a list of names</a> of 645 prisoners then detained at Bagram in response to a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/aclu-lawsuit-demands-information-on.php">filed</a> [JURIST reports] by the ACLU in September 2009. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Rights groups have criticized Yemen for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have persisted since February. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/MDE31/007/2011/en/5fa56895-8601-49c5-a7d0-a2fdecdfab5b/mde310072011en.pdf">report</a> [text; PDF] in April urging the international community to pressure Yemeni authorities to investigate protestor deaths.

According to OHCHR spokesperson Rupert Colville, executions in Saudi Arabia have nearly tripled since 2010. He also expressed concern over the recent sentencing of six Saudi men to "cross amputation," a punishment that involves amputating the right hand and left foot of a convicted individual. Saudi Arabia is a party to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cat.htm">Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment</a> [text], an absolute prohibition against torture and certain forms of cruel punishment. In a statement to reporters, Colville said "[w]e call on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to respect international standards guaranteeing due process and the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, to progressively restrict the use of the death penalty and to reduce the number of offences for which it may be imposed." Saudi Arabia imposes the death penalty for a number of crimes, including witchcraft and sorcery. 

<p>Saudi Arabia has been criticized for its capital punishment practices in the past. In July <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called for a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-group-urges-stop-to-saudi-executions.php">halt to executions</a> [JURIST report] in Saudi Arabia, claiming there is often a lack of basic procedural due process. AI cited the increase in capital punishment over 2011 as cause for concern. In 2008 AI released a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/saudi-execution-rate-connected-to.php">report</a> finding that Saudi Arabia <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/over-1200-people-executed-worldwide-in.php">executed more people per capita than any other nation</a> [JURIST reports]. According to that report, at least 1,252 people were put to death in 24 countries, with Saudi Arabia, China, Iran, Pakistan and the US accounting for the vast majority of the executions. In July of that year, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/saudi-arabia-urged-to-improve-domestic.php">criticizing a lack of legal protections</a> [JURIST report] for the 1.5 million migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia. Among other proposed reforms, HRW called on the Saudi government to amend the 2005 Labor Law to cover migrant workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/world/middleeast/hundreds-tortured-in-syria-human-rights-group-says.html">prisoners were detained</a> [NYT report] due to allegations that they were involved in "terrorist" activities. While more than 3,500 detainees have recently been released, human rights group <a href="http://www.avaaz.org/en/index.php">Avaaz</a> [advocacy website], estimates that 37,000 more remain in custody, despite the agreement, which demands that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile] free political prisoners, along with other requirements, including the removal of security forces and heavy weapons from cities. Avaaz also alleges that many prisoners remaining in detention are tortured. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=hrw&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrw.org%2F&ei=qRYKT8X6LKbg0QGHmLWfAg&usg=AFQjCNE1UcbodU_UEqN8tS53i3Jlr6JCdw">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] recognized that Syria has taken a few steps forward in meeting the obligations of the Arab League agreement but claims that the country has <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/06/syria-comply-agreement">failed to honor</a> [press release] the majority of these, and has even attempted to mislead Arab League monitors. As a result, HRW has urged the Arab League, which was scheduled to meet on Sunday to discuss the mission, to "draw clear lines regarding the Syrian government's responsibilities under the agreement and the conditions that need to be met for its monitors to do their essential work."

<p>Last month UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-condemns-escalating-syrian-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] leaders of the Syrian government and violent protesters for the continuous bloodshed within the country. Approximately <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/12/2011122353147515588.html">44 people were killed</a> [Al Jazeera report] before Christmas in two suicide car bomb attacks in Damascus. The <a href="http://www.sana.sy/index_eng.html">Syrian Arab News Agency</a> (SANA) [official website] has since linked the attacks to anti-government protests, while protesters and their supporters have suggested that the state planted attacks to coincide with an Arab League visit. Ban's press release pleaded that both groups resist violence. The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] echoed Ban's sentiments the same day, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40833&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">declaring</a> [UN News Centre report] that the recent car bombings were acts of terrorism. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

High Court Judge Mohamad Zabidin Diah said during the ruling that there was <a href="http://arabnews.com/world/article560879.ece">reasonable doubt</a> [AP report] in the case because of unreliable DNA evidence. Anwar has consistently argued that the allegations were a politically motivated attempt to silence his opposition to the current administration. In response, <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.my/?menu=page&page=1926">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile] said Monday the <a href="http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v6/newsindex.php?id=638886">accusations against the government were unfounded</a> [<em>Bernama</em> report] because the ruling shows the independence of the judiciary from politics. After the verdict, Anwar announced that he planned to run in the upcoming elections and hoped to oust Razak from power. Under Malaysian law, sodomy is punishable by 20 years in prison regardless of consent. <a href="http://amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] praised the ruling and urged Malaysia to <a href="http://amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/malaysia-anwar-case-shows-why-sodomy-law-must-be-scrapped-2012-01-09">repeal its sodomy law</a> [press release], calling the criminalization of adults' consensual sexual acts a human rights violation.

<p>The two-year sodomy trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/malaysia-opposition-leaders-sodomy-trial-concludes.php">concluded last month</a> when the prosecution delivered its closing arguments, following the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar-defense-rests-in-sodomy-trial.php">defense's closing arguments</a> in October and Anwar's testimony in August <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/malaysia-opposition-leader-denies-charges-at-sodomy-trial.php">denying the charges</a> [JURIST reports]. A Malaysian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/malaysia-high-court-finds-sodomy-case-against-opposition-leader-anwar-to-continue.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May that prosecutors had enough evidence to continue to pursue the sodomy case against Anwar. The opposition leader was <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">arrested</a> in July 2008 after he <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-anwar-files-suit-against.php">filed a lawsuit</a> against his <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/malaysia-opposition-leader-anwar.php">accuser</a> [JURIST reports] a month earlier. In December 2010, Anwar filed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/malaysia-opposition-leader-files-complaint-over-wikileaks-sodomy-cable.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] in a Malaysian court over a <a href="http://mirror.wikileaks.info/">WikiLeaks</a> [website] cable published by Australian newspapers stating he had engaged in sodomy. Anwar was Malaysia's deputy prime minister under former Mahathir Mohamad until he was fired in 1998 following earlier sodomy charges of which he was initially convicted but later acquitted. He reentered Malaysian politics following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/malaysia-10-year-post-conviction-ban-on.php">expiration of a 10-year ban</a> [JURIST report] against him for unrelated corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Iran accused Hekmati of spying for the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] and cooperating with an enemy government in an attempt to <a href="http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9010170433">accuse Iran of terrorism</a> [FNA report]. The conviction is largely based on a televised confession in which Hekmati admitted to entering the country with the intent to infiltrate the Islamic Republic of Iran's intelligence systems. The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/09/world/meast/iran-accused-spy/index.html">sentencing</a> [CNN report] came five months after Hekmati's arrest. His family alleges that the Iranian trial was not fair or transparent and maintains that Hekmati went to Iran to visit his grandmother. The US has repeatedly demanded Hekmati's release, claiming he was falsely accused.

<p><a href="/paperchase/2011/12/trial-begins-in-iran-for-alleged-cia-spy.php">Preliminary hearings</a> [JURIST report] for Hekmati began last month.

Bahrain was guided by recommendations from a panel of international investigators in its decision to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bahrain-overturns-death-sentences-protesters-15319731">transfer the protesters' case to civilian court</a> [AP report]. This case was transferred to civilian court along with several other cases including two high-profile cases of doctors and medical professionals who treated injured protesters.The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">original conviction</a> [JURIST report] was rendered by a special security court set up as part of the emergency law in place while the country's Sunni rulers attempted to silence a Shiite-led effort bolster civil and political rights in the country. The demonstrations in Bahrain began last February, during the protests that took place across that Arab world. Since then, over 40 protesters have died.

<p>In December UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said that the Bahrain government should <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-bahrain-government-should-release-protestors-rebuild-trust.php">release prisoners detained during peaceful protests</a> [JURIST report] and focus on rebuilding national trust in the government. Pillay's statement followed a visit by a team of human rights officials to Bahrain at the invitation of the Bahrain government. In November <a href="http://www.bahrainembassy.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=section.home&id=38">Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-king-orders-commission-to-study-report-on-rights-violations.php">ordered a special commission</a> [JURIST report] to look into government recommendations made in a report by an independent Bahraini government commission. The report stated that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">Bahrain authorities used excessive force</a> [JURIST report] and tortured detainees involved in the pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this year. Also in November, the Bahrain government <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-admits-use-of-excessive-force-against-pro-democracy-protesters.php">admitted the use of excessive force</a> [JURIST report] in anticipation of the independent report.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in May interpreted the statutory language <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/08/08-2262.pdf">in favor of the tribal contractors</a> [opinion, PDF], stating that the federal government must pay the costs because the annual federal funds available under the act were sufficient to cover any individual contract.

<p>Also Friday, the court agreed to rule in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-564.htm">Florida v. Jardines</a> [docket, <a href="http://grommit.com/blogs/ranga/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/jardines-cert_petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether the use of a drug-sniffing dog at the front door of a house is a search under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] requiring probable cause.

<p>On Monday the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/010912zor.pdf">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-1548.htm">Cash v.

The Ninth Circuit presented evidence showing that Maxwell's conviction had been based on testimony from an unreliable witness. However, Justices Scalia and Alito dissented to the denial of <em>certiorari</em>, arguing that the Ninth Circuit relied on circumstantial evidence and that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002254----000-.html">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of1996</a> (AEDPA) [text] prevented federal reconsideration of the case.

A subsequent <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] investigation revealed that 14 of the deaths were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/world/middleeast/14blackwater.html?_r=1">unjustified acts of excessive force</a> [NYT report]. A federal judge ruled last year that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-rules-blackwater-shooting-suit-can-proceed-in-state-court.php">lawsuit could proceed</a> [JURIST report] in North Carolina state court, saying that nonresidents lack the right to sue in federal court for injuries sustained outside of the country but that federal courts are obligated to remand such cases to the state level, where North Carolina law permits such suits.

This settlement closes the last lawsuit against the company for the 2007 incident. 

<p>Two ex-Blackwater contractors were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-blackwater-contractors-convicted-of-manslaughter-for-afghan-shootings----dnp.php">convicted of manslaughter</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Convicted-ex-blackwater-contractor-sentenced-to-2.5-years-for-manslaughter.php">sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison</a> [JURIST reports] last year for their role in the shooting deaths of two Afghan nationals and the wounding of a third. In April a federal grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/former-blackwater-executives-indicted.php">indicted five former Blackwater executives</a> [JURIST report] on charges of weapons violations and lying to investigators. In 2010 the Iraqi government <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/iraq-orders-former-blackwater-employees.php">ordered 250 former Blackwater employees to leave Iraq</a> in reaction to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-dismisses-charges-against.php">dismissal of criminal charges</a> [JURIST reports] against the guards involved in the 2007 shooting incident.

The court agreed last month to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-texas-redistricting-plan.php">hear an emergency appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenging an interim map drawn up by the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> while a separate map drawn up by the state legislature is currently being challenged in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official websites] for compliance with the <a  href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Two of the cases are titled <span class="casename">Perry, et al. v. Perez, et al.</span> and will deal with the Texas state House and the US congressional delegation, respectively, and the third case, titled <span class="casename">Perry, et al. v. Davis, et al.</span>, deals with the Texas state senate. It was unclear Monday how the justices would decide the case, but they must act quickly, with the 2012 primary elections approaching.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1062.pdf">Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-hear-another-confrontation-clause-case-on-admissibility-of-lab-tests.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] can enforce a compliance order issued without any opportunity to contest the order. The Sacketts own land near Priest Lake, Idaho, on which they intended to build a house. After purchasing the property and obtaining local permits, they began to grade the land for construction of a house. They received an EPA Administrative Compliance Order that said the grading of the land was in violation of the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [text, PDF] and imposed harsh civil penalties for non-compliance. The Sacketts disagree that their property is a wetland under the meaning of the CWA. The case raises the issue of whether the CWA precludes pre-enforcement judicial review, and if so, whether that violates the petitioner's <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/17/08-35854.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the dismissal of the suit. The justices appeared skeptical of the EPA's arguments Monday, with Justice Samuel Alito asking the EPA's lawyer, "if you related the facts of this case as they come to us to an ordinary homeowner, don't you think most ordinary homeowners would say this kind of thing can't happen in the United States?"</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1219.pdf">Kappos v. Hyatt</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on patent law. When the US <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">Patent and Trademark Office</a> (PTO) [official website] denies an application for a patent, the applicant may seek judicial review of the agency's final action through either of two avenues. The applicant may obtain direct review of the agency's determination in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_141.htm">35 USC &#167; 141</a> [text]. Alternatively, the applicant may commence a civil action against the Director of the PTO in federal district court under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_145.htm">35 USC &#167; 145</a> [text] The court will decide whether a plaintiff in a &#167; 145 action may introduce new evidence that could have been presented to the agency in the first instance. The court will also consider whether, when new evidence is introduced under &#167; 145, the district court may decide <em>de novo</em> the factual questions to which the evidence pertains, without giving deference to the prior decision of the PTO. The Federal Circuit <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/07-1066.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that "&#167; 145 imposes no limitation on an applicant's right to introduce new evidence before the district court."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 80-page report also says that those participating in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/world/middle-east-protests/">protest movement</a> [WP backgrounder], commonly referred to as "Arab Spring," for complete government reform in countries including <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=libya">Libya</a>, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=iraq">Iraq</a> [JURIST news archive], remain undeterred despite displays of violence as government response to the protests. AI <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/middle-east-and-north-africa-protest-and-repression-set-continue-2012-2012-01-09">expressed concerns</a> [press release] that governments were not making changes as quickly as promised. In reference to Egypt, AI said:<blockquote>Freedom of expression, association and assembly were promised, but the harsh reality is that criticism of the new authorities is not tolerated, activists are being targeted, and NGOs are being threatened with intrusive criminal investigations. Peaceful demonstrators continue to be forcibly dispersed, leading to clashes with riot police and deaths. Greater political participation by all Egyptians was promised, yet women have again been marginalized. Many independent trade unions have been formed, but the authorities have banned strikes. A better future for all Egyptians was promised, but nearly one year on millions of people continue to live in slums and in poverty, and wait for their voices to be heard.</blockquote>AI also made recommendations on changes that should be made in the Middle East and North Africa. Among those discussed, reformation of the security forces, reformation of the justice system and ensuring each country's laws are in accordance with international laws rank at the top of the list. 

<p>The violence and protests have have also caused concern at the UN. In December, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon issued a statement chastising both the government of President Bashar al-Assad and violent protesters regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-condemns-escalating-syrian-violence.php">continuous bloodshed in Syria</a> [JURIST report]. Also in December UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-egypt-military-crackdown.php">condemned the brutal crackdown</a> [JURIST report] on protesters by military and security forces in Egypt. In November, AI issued a report which concluded that Egypt's ruling military council has committed <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-chief-urges-independent-probe-into-egypt-violence.php">numerous human rights violations</a> [JURIST report], including abuse of protesters and journalists who voice their dissatisfaction with the government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A government committee <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4173201,00.html">approved the bill</a> [Ynetnews report] proposed by <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/main/eng/home.asp">Knesset</a> [official website] Member Uri Ariel which would impose a fine up to USD $26,000 and a possible jail sentence of six months. The bill was not approved by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.il/mojeng">Ministry of Justice</a>, but Justice Minister Yaakov Ne'eman said the bill will be supported after it is changed to coordinate policies of the Ministry of Justice and the <a href="http://mops.gov.il/english/Pages/HomePage.aspx">Ministry of Public Security</a> [official websites] in order to avoid infringement on rights to freedom of expression. Nazi symbols will be allowed to be used for educational and historical purposes.

<p>Apart from Israel, Nazi symbolism has been controversial in other countries as well. In 2007, the German Federal Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/german-court-rules-nazi-symbols-can-be.php">ruled Nazi symbols could be used to protest extremism</a> [JURIST report], overturning a prior decision by a state court in Stuttgart. The lower court had ordered Juergen Kamm, who began an Internet company called Nix Gut, to pay a fine of 3,600 euros (US $4,600) for selling T-shirts and badges featuring a swastika surrounded by a red circle and slash. Judge Walter Winkler ruled that for any symbol to be allowed, the anti-Nazi meaning had to be immediately apparent. In 2005, The EU <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/eu-drops-push-for-nazi-symbol-ban.php">ended consideration of proposals</a> [JURIST report] that would have banned Nazi symbols in the 25-country bloc after it became apparent that member states could not agree on which symbols should be included in the ban.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law also grants immunity to anyone who worked for Saleh's civil, military or security agencies during his 32-year reign as president. Some of the law's purposes are to "contribute to all the children of the Yemeni people in the process of construction and development" and "contain[] ... the effects caused by the internal crisis that occurred last period." Now that it has been passed by the council, the bill will be sent to Yemen's parliament for final approval.

<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay urged the Yemeni government Friday <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-chief-urges-yemen-to-deny-amnesty-for-human-rights-violations.php">not to pass the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report] because it would be unjust to the victims of human rights violations.

The UN Security also <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-security-council-urges-end-to-yemen-violence.php">urged the Yemeni government</a> [JURIST report] to stop violence against protesters in September, weeks after it had issued a press release <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11364&LangID=E">declaring a humanitarian crisis</a> [text] in the country. Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down</a> [JURIST report] from his office in April amidst pressure from nationwide protests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Frank Wuterich</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wuterich">news archive</a>] is <a href="http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforcent/Pages/LOAC/HadithaInvestigations.aspx">charged</a> [case materials] with voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, dereliction of duty and obstruction of justice in relation to the killings, which took place in the Iraqi town of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Haditha">Haditha</a> [JURIST news archive] after Wuterich supposedly overreacted to the roadside bombing death of a fellow Marine. Wuterich, who had no previous combat experience, allegedly ordered his men to "shoot first and ask questions later" when he <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gA-LpmS5c2KiA6PKwiTGrwERD5ZA?docId=CNG.83fcabb172c89120004a1e0d90be7afd.371">sent them to hunt for insurgents</a> [AFP report] in several houses along the road following the bombing. Many of the killed Iraqis were shot in the head inside the houses. The victims included 10 women and children killed at point-blank range. The Marine jurors for the trial include four officers and four enlisted men, ranging in rank from gunnery sergeant to lieutenant colonel, all of whom have done tours of duty in Iraq. Seven other marines were charged throughout the investigation, but charges were dismissed in six cases, and one Marine was acquitted, angering Iraqi authorities who wanted the Marines tried in Iraqi courts. Wuterich is the sole Marine still facing charges relating to the Haditha investigation.

<p>A US military judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-set-for.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] the charges against Wuterich in 2010, setting the trial in motion. His trial was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-court.php">postponed in 2008</a> [JURIST report] while prosecutors appealed a decision to get rid of a subpoena for an unaired portion of a CBS interview with him regarding the incident. Wuterich was originally charged with unpremeditated murder, but that charge was dropped after a <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/haditha-marine-squad-leader-should-not.php">recommendation from an investigating officer</a> [JURIST report] in 2007. Charges against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=chessani">Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani</a> [JURIST news archive] were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/military-judge-drops-charges-against-us.php">dropped</a> in June 2008, a decision that was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/military-appeals-court-upholds.php">upheld</a> [JURIST reports] the following March. Also in June 2008 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=andrew+grayson">1st Lt.

The court said that Gilani has failed to follow <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/pakistan-high-court-orders-government.php">court orders</a> [JURIST report] to reopen corruption cases against <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website]. The court also accused the government of violating the constitution and threatening the balance of power in the country:<blockquote>Obedience to the command of a court, and that too of the Apex Court of the country, is not a game of chess or a game of hide and seek. It is, of course, a serious business and governance of the State and maintaining the constitutional balance and equilibrium cannot be allowed to be held hostage to political tomfoolery or shenanigans. ... We may unhesitatingly observe that in our country governed by a Constitution political loyalty cannot be accepted as stronger than loyalty to the State and dictates of a political master or party cannot be allowed to be put up as a defence to failure to obey the Constitution.</blockquote>The Chief Justice will review the case and consider several options suggested by the court, including executing court proceedings against Gilani and Zardari, ordering Gilani excluded from Parliament, forming a commission to aid in the performance of the court orders or delaying a decision to allow the people to decide the next step. A hearing is scheduled for January 16, which Gilani must attend.

<p>Pakistan has faced an ongoing struggle with corruption that the courts have attempted to battle. Last month, the Supreme Court formed a judicial committee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/pakistan-supreme-court-to-investigate-memo-scandal.php">investigate a secret memo</a> [JURIST report] sent from an unknown Pakistani source to US Admiral Mike Mullen in May asking for help in preventing a suspected army coup. Zardari and former Pakistan ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani have been accused of writing or having knowledge of the memo, and both have denied these allegations. Tuesday's warning stems from court orders issued when the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/pakistan-high-court-releases-detailed.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2010, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999. The NRO was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by former Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4797762.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile] in 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill amends the <a href="http://www.israellawresourcecenter.org/emergencyregs/fulltext/preventioninfiltrationlaw.htm">Prevention of Infiltration Law of 1954</a> [text], broadening the law to include not only individuals suspected of terrorism, but all illegal migrants. Under the new law, individuals living in the country illegally can be arrested and held in prison indefinitely without trial. Israelis caught helping illegal migrants will face up to 15 years in prison if the migrants are involved in criminal activities. Currently, the Israeli government may not detain illegal migrants for more than 60 days. For years, Israeli <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/PM/Resume/">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official profile], who voted for the bill, has <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/PMOEng/Archive/Press+Releases/2010/08/spokestart010810.htm">expressed his concern</a> [press release] over increasing waves of illegal immigration into Israel, particularly from Africa. Netanyahu has called such migration a "tangible threat" to the Jewish majority in the country. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] has criticized the bill as a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.il/?CategoryID=319&ArticleID=349">violation of human rights</a> [press release] and international treaties, including the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html">Refugee Rights Convention of 1951</a> [UNHCR materials], which aided Jewish refugees after World War II. More than 18,000 Africans are believed to have migrated illegally into Israel by crossing the border with Egypt. 

<p>The Israeli government has been active in passing strict laws in the new year. An Israeli government panel Monday approved a bill that would make it <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-use-of-nazi-symbolism.php">illegal to use any Nazi symbols</a> [JURIST report], names, or images, including the use of the term "Nazi" and any clothing resembling that worn by prisoners at concentration camps. The bill would impose a fine up to USD $26,000 and a possible jail sentence of six months, although Nazi symbols would be allowed for educational and historical purposes. Last week, Knesset passed a law that <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-lawmakers-approve-new-rules-for-selecting-supreme-court-justices.php">changed the rules</a> [JURIST report] governing the selection of <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Supreme Court</a> [official website] justices. The law <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/israeli-lawmakers-advance-legislation-that-critics-say-undermines-judiciarys-independence/2012/01/03/gIQANYsZXP_story.html">has been criticized</a> [AP report] for undermining the independence of the judiciary in an effort to further a conservative judge favored by the government. Many fear the new laws will influence judicial decisions, impede upon the rights of the press and be used to harass liberal groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thaler</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-upholds-gender-discrimination-ruling-takes-4-more-cases.php">report</a>] interpreting two sections of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/antiterrorism_and_effective_death_penalty_act_of_1996_aedpa">Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a> (AEDPA) [materials] and holding that a judgment becomes final for the purposes of <em>habeas corpus</em> review when the time for pursuing direct review to either state's high court or the Supreme Court expires. Additionally the court held that a federal district court's failure to cite a constitutional issue on a certificate of appealability (COA) as required by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/usc_sec_28_00002253----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 2253(c)</a> [text] does not deprive the court of appeals of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the <em>habeas</em> petitioner's appeal. Petitioner Rafael Gonzalez was convicted of murder in Texas and had his conviction affirmed by the state's intermediate appellate court in 2006. Gonzalez failed to file an appeal with the <a href="http://www.cca.courts.state.tx.us/">Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website], the state's highest court for criminal appeals, and his period for discretionary review with the court expired on August 11, 2006. He filed a petition for <em>habeas</em> relief on January 24, 2008, alleging that a nearly 10-year delay between his indictment and trial violated his right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] of the US Constitution. Both the district court and the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the <em>habeas</em> petition was barred due to failure to file the petition within one year of final judgment as required by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00002244----000-.html">28 USC &#167;2244(d)(1)</a> [text]. In an 8-1 decision authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court concluded that &#167;2244(d)(1) consists of two prongs, relating to distinct categories of petitioners&#8212;those seeking <em>habeas</em> relief at the end of a direct review, and those seeking <em>habeas</em> relief without exhausting direct reviews of appeals on the merits of the case. According to the court:<blockquote>For petitioners who pursue direct review all the way to this Court, the judgment becomes final at the "conclusion of direct review"&#8212;when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits or denies a petition for certiorari. For all other petitioners, the judgment becomes final at the "expiration of the time for seeking such review"&#8212;when the time for pursuing direct review in this Court, or in state court, expires.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia authored the dissenting opinion in the case arguing that failure of a federal district court to identify a substantial constitutional violation as required by &#167; 2253(c) should prevent the court of appeals from having jurisdiction and stating that the court's ruling "makes a hash of the statute" and its jurisdictional requirements. 

<p>The court heard <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-eyewitness-identification.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. During arguments, the petitioner argued that a COA that does not fully comply with all the requirements of the statute, nonetheless confers jurisdiction on the federal appeals court. Petitioner also argued that the one-year statute of limitations for federal <em>habeas corpus</em> review should not begin until the ruling is final according to State law, as opposed to a uniform federally-imposed definition of a final ruling. The state argued that, because the COA was incomplete due to the district court judge's error, it did not meet the requirements of the statute and, therefore, did not confer jurisdiction on the appeals court. The state also argued that the statute provides a two-prong to determine with the clock starts to run and that, even where that might start the clock running before state <em>habeas corpus</em> review becomes available, the clock should start nonetheless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Approved by approximately <a href="http://www.ok.gov/elections/support/10gen.html">70 percent</a> [election results] of Oklahoma voters, but challenged by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://sun.cair.com/">Council on American-Islamic Relations</a> (CAIR) [advocacy websites], State Question 755, also called the "Save Our State Amendment," was classified by the court as singling out Islam for unfavorable treatment in state courts. The court ruled that the provision likes violates the Establishment Clause of the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/">First Amendment</a> [text]:<blockquote>Federal courts should be wary of interfering with the voting process, but we agree with the district court and the Sixth Circuit that "'it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party&#8217;s constitutional rights.'" ... "While the public has an interest in the will of the voters being carried out ... the public has a more profound and long-term interest in upholding an individual's constitutional rights." ... We therefore hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the preliminary injunction was not adverse to the public interest.</blockquote>Though defended by Oklahoma Solicitor General Patrick Wyrick as necessary to prevent confusion in the courts, Daniel Mach, director of the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion-belief">Program on Freedom and Religion and Belief</a> [advocacy website], said in a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/court-upholds-ruling-blocking-oklahoma-sharia-and-international-law-ban">press release</a> [text] that "this amendment did nothing more than target one faith for official condemnation ... [and] [e]ven the state admits that there has never been any problem with Oklahoma courts wrongly applying religious law." Moreover, Chandra Bhatnagar, senior attorney with the ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/human-rights">Human Rights Program</a> [advocacy website], added that "[a]ttempts to paint international law as irrelevant to the American legal system are wrong-headed and dangerous," and that preventing courts from considering international law violates the Constitution and undermines the ability of courts to interpret laws and treaties.

<p>Despite its <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">approval</a> by voters in November 2010, the Oklahoma state amendment was soon after <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/federal-judge-blocks-oklahoma-islamic-law-ban.php">blocked by a federal judge</a> [JURIST reports]. Before Tuesday's ruling, the constitutionality of the amendment has been consistently controversial, as it has been both condemned as <a href="/hotline/2010/11/oklahoma-ban-of-sharia-deems-Islam-as-un-american.php">un-American</a> [JURIST comment], and also supported as a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1325986/Sharia-law-banned-Oklahoma-US-state-veto-Islamic-code.html">preemptive strike</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] against the use of Islamic law in Oklahoma.

The ex-president was the head of the 1980 military coup that overthrew the existing government and ended the violence between the left and right-wing groups. The former air force chief Tahsin Sahinkaya was also included in the indictment. They are the only two survivors of the five men who planned the coup. Evren was first questioned in June when <a href="http://www.constitution.org/cons/turkey/part6.htm">Article 15 of the Constitution</a> [text], which has given immunity to the leaders of the coup, was amended. The prosecution is seeking life imprisonment. The trial date has not yet been set.

<p>The acceptance of the indictment came after the prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/turkish-ex-president-faces-possible-life-sentence-for-1980-military-coup.php">charged the two men</a> [JURIST report] last week. Turkey has been facing numerous coup plots during the past years and continues to bring charges against military officials and individuals for such crimes against the government. In November, 13 Turkish journalists <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/turkish-journalists-on-trial-for-alleged-coup-plot.php">were accused of plotting</a> [JURIST report] to overthrow the government. In August, the court also <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/turkish-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-seven-military-officers.php">issued arrest warrants</a> [JURIST report] for seven generals and admirals in relation with allegations that they created an anti-government website in 2009.

The CCR filed the lawsuit in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on behalf of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/q/mohammed_al_qahtani/index.html?scp=1-spot&sq=mohammed%20al%20qahtani&st=cse">Mohammed al-Qahtani</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=al+qahtani">news archive</a>], a Saudi citizen believed to be the twentieth hijacker in the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST news archive]. The CCR claims that the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/amended-foia-redlined.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text, PDF] compels the US government to publicly release the videotapes. The complaint argues that releasing the videotapes would serve the public interest "by providing the American [people] with unique documentation of the systematic abuses at Guantanamo." The comlaint also graphically describes the brutality  al-Qahtani allegedly experienced in Guantanamo: "Mr. al-Qahtani's treatment consisted of daily 20-hour interrogation periods, along with severe sleep deprivation and isolation. United States military personnel flooded Mr. al-Qahtani's cell with light and loud music and/or sound during his brief periods of rest. He was isolated from other prisoners and deprived of sensory stimulation under a harsh regime of solitary confinement." A spokesperson for federal government attorneys in New York declared that the government had <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GUANTANAMO_LAWSUIT?SITE=MOSTP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">no comment on the lawsuit</a> [AP report].

<p>Al-Qahtani has been at the center of many controversies pertaining to the treatment of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. In April the US military <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/world/guantanamo-files-lives-in-an-american-limbo.html?hp">released hundreds of classified documents to select news organizations</a> [NYT report], including one which revealed that al-Qahtani was leashed like a dog, sexually humiliated and forced to urinate on himself. In January 2009 Susan Crawford, then-convening authority of military commissions, <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/bush-administration-official-says.php">admitted</a> [JURIST report] that torture tactics were used against al-Qahtani. Crawford refused to allow prosecution of al-Qahtani because he was tortured. In November 2008 US military prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/us-military-prosecutors-filing-new.php">filed a new set of charges</a> against al-Qahtani over his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks, after <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-military-drops-charges-against-so.php">dropping charges in May 2008</a> [JURIST reports] following suspicions that al-Qahtani's statements were <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/suspected-20th-hijacker-recants.php">coerced by US torture</a> [JURIST report]. US military personnel captured al-Qahtani in Afghanistan in December 2001 and transferred him to Guantanamo, where he has been held ever since.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pollard</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-to-rule-on-claim-against-private-prison-contractors.php">report</a>] that where state tort law authorizes adequate remedies for individuals harmed by private employees working at a federal facility, and where the private employees have no employment or contractual relationship with the government, no remedy under <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion text] can be applied. Respondent Richard Lee Pollard filed a complaint in 2002 against employees of the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, which operated the federal prison facility where he was a prisoner. Pollard alleged that employees violated his <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eight Amendment</a> [text] rights by denying him adequate medical care which resulted in injury and "cruel and unusual punishment." The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/05-12-Minneci-opinion-below.pdf">reversed</a> [opinion, PDF] a federal district court judge and held that the Eight Amendment provided Pollard with a <span class="casename">Bivens</span> action against the private prison employees. In the majority opinion authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court held that in determining whether a <span class="casename">Bivens</span> remedy can be applied to alleged Eight Amendment violations, "the question is whether, in general, state tort law remedies provide roughly similar incentives for potential defendants to comply with the Eighth Amendment while also providing roughly similar compensation to victims of violations." The court concluded that while state law tort remedies may be more limited than some <span class="casename">Bivens</span> remedies, prisoners alleging a violation of their Eight Amendment rights by private employees at federal facilities would have adequate remedies under state tort law, and therefore no <span class="casename">Bivens</span> remedy can apply. Justice Antonin Scalia authored a concurring opinion in the case in which he was joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the lone dissenter in the case. 

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-government-immunity-prisoner-rights.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. During oral arguments the court appeared to be strongly convinced by the government-petitioner's argument that <span class="casename">Bivens</span> should continue to be used as a last resort and not expanded when state law provides adequate redress. Respondents argued that <span class="casename">Bivens</span> casts a wide net and allows any specific civil action that is not delineated by that state's law, whereas several justices argued with the attorney that almost any action could be addressed by state tort law. Respondent also suggested that as his client was a federal prisoner prosecuted by the federal government, with only access to federal law in the prison library, he should be allowed to address his claims in federal court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Greenwood</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that, because the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/croa/croa.shtm">Credit Repair Organizations Act</a> (CROA) is silent on whether claims can proceed in an arbitrable forum, the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/9/usc_sup_01_9.html">Federal Arbitration Act</a> (FAA) [text] requires the arbitration agreement to be enforced according to its terms. The case arose from a dispute between consumers and companies that issue low-rate credit cards to people with bad credit. The consumers filed a lawsuit over credit card fees, and the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that they <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/08/17/09-15906.pdf">had a right to sue in federal court</a> [opinion, PDF] rather than face arbitration. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit:<blockquote>The flaw in [respondents'] argument is its premise: that the disclosure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an action in a court of law. It does not. Rather, it imposes an obligation on credit repair organizations to supply consumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation marks) in the statute. The only consumer right it <em>creates</em> is the right to receive the statement, which is meant to describe the consumer protections that the law <em>elsewhere</em> provides.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, which Justice Elena Kagan joined. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-workers-compensation-arbitration.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in October. The attorney for CompuCredit argued that strong federal policy in favor of arbitration overrides any differing laws that discourage waivers of rights to sue. Respondents argued that the CROA explicitly bans any suggestion of waiving the right to sue and that credit card companies should be fined for even asking applicants to sign an arbitration waiver.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cain</a> [JURIST report] to overturn the conviction of Juan Smith due to the <a href = "http://www.nola.gov/en/GOVERNMENT/Orleans-District-Attorney">New Orleans District Attorney's office</a> [official website] withholding material evidence from the defense. Smith was convicted of murder largely on the testimony of one eyewitness. However, the District Attorney's office had statements from the witness that indicated he had not properly identified Smith, which was not turned over to Smith and his defense during the proceedings. Chief Justice John Roberts explained that this was a clear violation of <a href = "http://supreme.justia.com/us/373/83/case.html">Brady v. Maryland</a> [text] as the case rested solely on the eyewitness' credibility:<blockquote>We have observed that evidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the State's testimony was the only evidence linking Smith to the crime. And Boatner's undisclosed statements directly contradict his testimony: Boatner told the jury that he had "[n]o doubt" that Smith was the gunman he stood "face to face" with on the night of the crime, but [the police detective's] notes show Boatner saying that he "could not ID anyone because [he] couldn't see faces" and "would not know them if [he] saw them." Boatner's undisclosed statements were plainly material.</blockquote>Other allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in this case were not ruled on, as this instance of withholding evidence was sufficient to overturn the conviction. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that the state had adequately convicted Smith without the eyewitness testimony.

<p><span class = "casename">Smith v.

This scrutiny has been ongoing for 15 years, beginning with <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-7927.ZO.html">Kyles v. Whitley</a> [text], as the New Orleans District Attorney's office continues a policy of withholding exculpatory evidence from the defense.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1293.pdf">FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] current indecency enforcement regime violates the <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First</a> or <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth Amendments</a> [text] to the US Constitution by being too vague to be enforced properly. The case hinges on indecency issues raised in two separate broadcasts, one in which a deliberate nudity scene appeared in a television crime show during prime-time hours, and the other involving celebrities using expletives during live broadcasting events. The FCC's current policy reserves it the right to revoke a broadcaster's license renewal if something "patently offensive" occurs. Broadcasters have argued that the definition of patently offensive, which has been created through an amalgamation of past sanctions the FCC has doled out, is unclear. The Solicitor General, appealing the Second Circuit's ruling that the FCC's policy is <a href = "/paperchase/2010/07/federal-appeals-court-rules-fcc-indecency-policy-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutionally vague</a> [JURIST report], argued that the policy is clear and provides constructive notice and that circumstances have not changed enough to modify the underlying principles of <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9738309099999149495&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">FCC v. Pacifica</a> [text]. Attorneys for Fox argued that the current policy is unduly vague and that there are enough outside protections (such as a V-chip) to prevent indecency from reaching those who do not want to hear it. He also contended that the FCC is clearly failing in its duties to enforce adequately:<blockquote>And as we sit here today, literally facing thousands and thousands of ginned-up computer-generated complaints that are holding up literally hundreds of TV license renewals, so that the whole system has come to a screeching halt because of the difficulty of trying to resolve these issues. So to say that the system is working well seems to me, at least from the broadcasters' perspective, is to suggest that's just not true.</blockquote>Fox had support from several other radio and television networks, which also argued against the FCC's policy. Justice Sonia Sotomayor recused herself from this case.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1121.pdf">Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000</a> (SEIU) [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether the First and <a href = "http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendments</a> [text] allow a state to compel non-union members to pay into union funds that are being used for political advocacy that they disagree with, thus making support of that political stance a condition for employment. There is also a question as to whether notice that this is a condition of employment makes the condition sufficient. However, between the time <em>certiorari</em> was granted and oral arguments, SEIU had decided that they were not going to defend the case further and would argue mootness, due to the original officers of the union no longer holding those positions and that the union has created a new procedure to address the issue at hand. The plaintiffs argued that the court should still rule on the financial award at stake.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to the sonogram, the new law also dictates that the woman must listen to a detailed description of the development of the fetus. Any doctor who does not comply with the standards could lose his or her license to practice medicine. The suit, brought by a class of doctors represented by the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website], claimed the new law violates the First Amendment by compelling speech. The appeals court determined that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits, citing the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-744.ZS.html">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text] which found that providing truthful, non-misleading facts did not pose an undue burden on women:<blockquote>The Court's decision in <em>Casey</em> accented the state's interest in potential life, holding that its earlier decisions following <em>Roe</em> failed to give this interest force at all stages of a pregnancy and that in service of this interest the state may insist that a woman be made aware of the development of the fetus at her stage of pregnancy. Significantly, the Court held that the fact that such truthful, accurate information may cause a woman to choose not to abort her pregnancy only reinforces its relevance to an informed decision. Insisting that a doctor give this information in his traditional role of securing informed consent is permissible. Texas has done just this and affords three exceptions to its required delivery of information about the stage of fetal growth where in its judgment the information had less relevance, a legislative judgment that is at least rational.</blockquote><a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] issued a statement after the ruling claiming that the law is <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/texas-panel-upholds-demeaning-law-38528.htm">demeaning and intrusive</a> [press release] and would intimidate women. The CRR has not decided whether to challenge the law in front of the full Fifth Circuit, but has said that it will <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/extreme-new-appeals-court-decision-allows-enforcement-of-intrusive-anti-choice-ultrasound">continue to pursue a challenge</a> [press release] to the law.

<p>Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">signed the measure into law</a> in May, but it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-key-provisions-of-texas-abortion-law.php">blocked</a> in August by a federal judge after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">challenge</a> [JURIST reports] from the CRR. Both Oklahoma and North Carolina have enacted similar laws. A federal judge granted a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against the North Carolina in October. With the sonogram portion temporarily removed, the rest of the North Carolina law went into force. Oklahoma's law has also been <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/oklahoma-court-blocks-requiring-pre-abortion-ultrasounds.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

New Hampshire</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the Due Process Clause does not require a preliminary judicial inquiry into the reliability of an eyewitness identification when the identification was not procured under unnecessarily suggestive circumstances arranged by law enforcement. The petitioner was convicted based in part on an eyewitness identification made while he was in handcuffs, albeit not orchestrated by the police. The New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld his conviction, and the Supreme Court affirmed in an opinion authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg:<blockquote>Given the safeguards generally applicable in criminal trials, protections availed of by the defense in Perry's case, we hold that the introduction of Blandon's eyewitness testimony, without a preliminary judicial assessment of its reliability, did not render Perry&#8217;s trial fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented:<blockquote>Our cases thus establish a clear rule: The admission at trial of out-of-court eyewitness identifications derived from impermissibly suggestive circumstances that pose a very substantial likelihood of misidentification violates due process. The Court today announces that that rule does not even "com[e] into play" unless the suggestive circumstances are improperly "police-arranged."</blockquote>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-eyewitness-identification.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. The petitioner argued that it was fundamentally unfair to allow potentially erroneous eyewitness identifications into the trial simply because they were not orchestrated by police. New Hampshire, supported by the US Solicitor General as <em>amicus curiae</em>, argued that the rules of evidence provided sufficient safeguards and that cases where the erroneous identifications were disallowed were aimed at deterring police misconduct, which no one has alleged in the case at hand. In addition, the government urged it is the primary role of the jury to assess the reliability of evidence and handing that determination to the judge would be a fundamental shift in our trial practice. The court questioned whether the role of these due process protections was strictly deterrence or whether it also included prevention of injustice, as urged by petitioner. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The accusations against Kagame stem from the April 6, 1994, plane crash that killed Habyarimana when his plane was shot down by a missile. The French team investigating the incident visited the site of the crash in order to determine the trajectory of the missile. They concluded that the missile came from an area held by the Rwandan army, a unit of elite presidential troops, making it <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16472013">unlikely that Kagame could have been behind the attack</a> [BBC report]. The death of Habyarimana is one of the incidents which sparked the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=1994+Rwandan+genocide+">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive; HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/">backgrounder</a>].  

<p>Rwanda has been continually scrutinized in relation to the 1994 genocide. In a report released in June of last year, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] urged Rwanda to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/amnesty-calls-on-rwanda-to-review-genocide-laws-ideology-used-to-silence-dissent.php">review laws it claims have a "genocide ideology"</a> [JURIST report] that are being used to silence critics and dissenters. AI claims that Rwanda has broadly drafted hate speech laws passed since the 1994 genocide that are being used to criminalize legitimate criticism and expression that does not rise to the level of hate speech. In April 2010, Rwandan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/rwanda-opposition-leader-arrested-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] opposition presidential candidate <a href="http://www.victoire2010.com/english/index.html">Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza</a> [campaign website], accusing her of denying the 1994 genocide. The arrests come at a time when Kagame has received criticism from <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] for his treatment of opposition parties. Last August, Peter Erlinder, former defense counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, <a href="/forum/2010/08/rwanda-flawed-elections-and-the-politics-of-genocide-denial.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that even though the White House has become more openly critical of Rwandan President Paul Kagame's regime, the US and international community at large must take a much closer look at those in power before true reconciliation will come to Rwanda.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Valladolid</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode43/usc_sup_01_43_10_29_20_III.html">Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act</a> (OCSLA) [43 USC &#167;&#167; 1331-1356 text] extends coverage to an employee who can establish a substantial nexus between his injury and his employer's extractive operations on the outer continental shelf (OCS). The OCSLA governs those who work on oil drilling platforms and other fixed structures beyond state maritime boundaries, and workers are eligible for compensation for "any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the [OCS]." Juan Valladolid worked for Pacific Operations Offshore, stationed primarily on an offshore drilling platform, but was killed on the grounds of Pacific Operations' onshore oil processing facility when he was crushed by a forklift. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/05/13/08-73862.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of Valladolid's estate. In an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court affirmed:<blockquote>Although the Ninth Circuit&#8217;s test may not be the easiest to administer, it best reflects the text of &#167;1333(b), which establishes neither a situs-of-injury nor a "but for" test. We are confident that ALJs and courts will be able to determine whether an injured employee has established a significant causal link between the injury he suffered and his employer's on-OCS extractive operations. Although we expect that employees injured while performing tasks on the OCS will regularly satisfy the test, whether an employee injured while performing an off-OCS task qualifies&#8212;like Valladolid, who died while tasked with onshore scrap metal consolidation&#8212;is a question that will depend on the individual circumstances of each case.</blockquote>Justice Scalia authored a concurrence, which was joined by Justice Samuel Alito.

<p>Wednesday's ruling settles a split among the circuit courts. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-workers-compensation-arbitration.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in October. Pacific Operators Offshore argued that the OCSLA has no remedy for an injury that occurred on dry land, but rather Valladolid should have sought relief through state workers compensation law. The federal government argued that the OCSLA covers injuries or death on dry land explicitly, but not under the "nexus" reasoning the Ninth Circuit utilized. Valladolid's attorney argued that, pursuant to similar treatment in the <a href="http://www.1800jonesact.com/maritime_statutes/default.html">Jones Act</a> [text], his client's estate should be compensated for his death that occurred on land.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The South Carolina legislation requires police officers to check a suspect's immigration status during a lawful stop, seizure, detention or arrest if they believe the person may be in the country illegally and requires businesses to participate in the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=75bce2e261405110VgnVCM1000004718190aRCRD">E-Verify</a> [official website] system. An Arizona judge struck down similar provisions in that state's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials] and issued an injunction, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/ninth-circuit-upholds-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], barring provisions of the law from taking effect. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in December to rule Arizona's controversial immigration law <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-182.htm">Arizona v. United States</a> [docket] to determine if Arizona's law is preempted by federal law.

<p>Similar immigration laws are being challenged throughout the US. In December a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-blocks-portions-of-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] portions of the South Carolina law. Judge Richard Gergel blocked the provision that requires police to check immigration status, finding, "[t]his state-mandated scrutiny is without consideration of federal enforcement priorities and unquestionably vastly expands the persons targeted for immigration enforcement action. He also blocked the provision that outlaws harboring or transporting an illegal immigrant, finding a likelihood of irreparable harm. The law was set to take effect January 1. Also in December, Alabama and Georgia filed motions in the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/states-seek-to-delay-immigration-cases-pending-supreme-court-ruling.php">stay proceedings</a> [JURIST report] on challenges to their immigration laws pending the Supreme Court ruling in <span class="casename">Arizona v. United States</span>. A challenge is also pending to an immigration law in <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-utah-immigration-law.php">Utah</a>, and an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-enjoins-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana law has been blocked</a> [JURIST reports] by a federal judge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontguantanamosign.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Wednesday marked the tenth annivesary of the detention center at <a href="/feature/2012/01/guantanamo.php">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. On January 11, 2002, 20 detainees arrived at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, imprisoned as the first "enemy combatants" in the War on Terror declared by the US after <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The 20 men were the first of nearly 800 prisoners to pass through the US military detention center over 10 years, and the prison has evolved into a multimillion dollar facility since its inception. Edwin Meese III, attorney general under Ronald Reagan, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/11/opinion/meese-gitmo/index.html">calls</a> [CNN op-ed] the detention and interrogation facility a "world-class, state-of-the-art" necessity that "has served and continues to serve an important role in the war against terrorists since it opened 10 years ago." Meese says Guantanamo has "played an invaluable role in the war against terrorists by keeping them off the battlefield and allowing for lawful interrogations" and it should remain open "until a safe, reasonable alternative facility" is fashioned. Conversely, many see Guantanamo's continued operation as an affront to the principles under which the US was founded, and advocacy groups around the world have called for the center's closure. Amnesty International (AI) has prepared a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/guantanamo_10_report.pdf">tenth anniversary report</a> [text, PDF] condemning Guantanamo, stating its practices "continue to inflict serious damage on global respect for human rights." Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/06/guantanamo-ten-years">writes</a> [press release] that it opposes the prolonged indefinite detention without trial of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere" and sent a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/10/letter-president-obama-end-detention-without-trial-and-close-guantanamo">letter to President Obama</a> [text] urging him "to reaffirm his stated commitment to closing Guantanamo by prosecuting detainees in federal court and repatriating and resettling those who will not be prosecuted." The ACLU <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-statement-ten-years-guantanamo">states</a> [press release] unequivocally, "Guantanamo has been a catastrophic failure on every front. It is long past time for this shameful episode in American history to be brought to a close." UK Prime Minister David Cameron marked the anniversary in Parliament by stating that Britain is working "very hard" with the US to help close Guantanamo, and a UK columnist <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/11/guantanamo-bay-10-years-on">writes</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that Guantanamo's continued operation after 10 years is "mocking America's claim to moral supremacy and acting as a powerful recruiting tool for the country's enemies." Moazzam Begg, a 43-year-old British Muslim and former Guantanamo inmate, claims he was wrongly detained, abused and tortured in US custody. Begg observed the tenth anniversary by predicting that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/11/world/guantanamo-detainee-talks/index.html">Guantanamo will never close</a> [CNN report], and to hope otherwise is simply fantasy.

<p>Currently <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/">171 detainees</a> [NYT docket] are held at Guantanamo. The Obama administration originally wanted suspected terrorists to be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a>, but <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">changed its position</a> after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST reports] barring the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the US, despite repeated appeals from rights groups to utilize civilian courts over military commissions. Last March, UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism <a href="http://web.abo.fi/instut/imr/research/martin_scheinin_cv.htm">Martin Scheinin</a> [official website] called on the Obama administration to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-experts-urge-civilian-trials.php">hold civilian trials</a> [JURIST report] for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other suspected terrorists saying that the military commissions system is fatally flawed and cannot be reformed. Earlier that month, the ACLU released a full-page advertisement in the <em>New York Times</em> <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/aclu-urges-obama-to-try-911-suspects-in.php">urging President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report] to uphold his pledge to try 9/11 suspects in civilian criminal court. That release came just days after White House advisers announced they were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/white-house-still-considering-trying.php">considering recommending</a> [JURIST report] that Mohammed be tried in a military court rather than through the civilian criminal justice system. In an interview in 2010, Holder stated that the main goal of the administration is to <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/holder-confirms-no-final-decision-on-trial-venue-for-accused-911-conspirators.php">hold the people responsible</a> [JURIST report] for 9/11 accountable in the most effective way possible. Holder reiterated his support for <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">holding the trials in civilian courts</a> [JURIST report], saying that the criminal justice system has been proven an effective location for terrorism trials and that excluding civilian courts as a possible tool in fighting terrorism would ultimately weaken the nation's security. Holder announced in November 2009 that Mohammed would be <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">tried in a civilian court</a> [JURIST report] in Manhattan, drawing intense criticism and leading the Obama administration to reconsider the decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ghulam Azam, 89, was <a href="http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=215760&cid=3">taken into custody</a> [bdnews24.com report] Wednesday after his preemptive request for bail, based on health and age, was denied by the court on Tuesday. A hearing has been scheduled for February 15 to formally establish charges against him. Azam, who opposed the independence of Bangladesh and allegedly aided the Pakistani Army during the war, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16502175">maintains that the charges are politically motivated</a> [BBC report]. He functioned as chief of JI in Bangladesh until 2000. 

<p>In November the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-begins-first-trial.php">ICTB began its first trial</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity committed during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The defendant is Delwar Hossain Sayedee, a former member of Parliament in the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.bd/">National Assembly of Bangladesh</a> [official website, in Bengali] and one of the former leaders of JI. Earlier that month ICTB prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bangladesh-political-leader-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">filed an application</a> [JURIST report] for formal charges against Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, a former leader of the <a href="http://bangladeshnationalistparty-bnp.org/">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> [party website] who is also accused of crimes against humanity during the Liberation War. In May <a href="http://hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] sent a letter to the Bangladesh government praising its efforts through the ICTB to prosecute war crimes, but urging the government to ensure that the trials are carried out <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/hrw-urges-further-amendments-to-bangladesh-international-crimes-tribunal.php">in accordance with international human rights expectations</a> [JURIST report].

Legislators re-introduced the bill this year after New Jersey <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> (R) [official website] <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552011/approved/20110825c.html">conditionally vetoed legislation</a> [press release] last June that would have <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-jersey-legislature-passes-ban-on-shale-gas-fracking.php">permanently banned fracking in New Jersey</a> [JURIST report]. When Christie vetoed the bill, he instituted a one-year moratorium on fracking in order to study its potential consequences. The bill passed on Monday asserts that public safety concerns stemming from uncertainty over the environmental consequences of fracking necessitate a ban on the practice:<blockquote>[T]he drilling technique of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas exploration and production has been found to use a variety of contaminating chemicals and materials that can suddenly and in an uncontrolled manner be introduced into the surface waters and ground water of the State; that the companies engaging in the use of this drilling technique have been less than forthcoming in revealing the "cocktail" of chemicals and their volume that can be introduced into these waters ... The Legislature therefore determines it is prudent and in the best interest of the people of the State of New Jersey to prohibit hydraulic fracturing in the State for the purpose of natural gas exploration or production.</blockquote>The bill now goes to Christie, who can either sign or veto it.

<p>Fracking has been a contentious issue recently, both in the US and abroad. Fracking is a process in which water, sand and chemicals are pumped into the ground to create fractures in rocks which allows trapped gas and oil to come to surface. Proponents trumpet the technique for providing people with abundant energy as well as for creating jobs in a tough economy. Opponents of fracking point out its negative consequences on the environment and public health. In October the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/epa-announces-plan-to-develop-standards-for-fracking-wastewater-discharge.php">announced plans to develop standards</a> [JURIST report] for wastewater discharge from fracking. In July JURIST contributor Joseph Schaeffer <a href="/dateline/2011/07/joseph-schaeffer-hydraulic-fracturing.php">wrote extensively</a> [JURIST op-ed] about communities in Appalachia preemptively passing laws to curb fracking. In June New York <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/about.html">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-ag-sues-us-government-for-failure-to-study-fracking-impact.php">sued the US government</a> [JURIST report] for its alleged failure to study the risks of fracking. In May France's lower house <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/france-lower-house-approves-ban-on-shale-gas-tapping.php">approved a nationwide ban on fracking</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

EEOC</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/free_exercise_clause">Free Exercise Clauses</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] of the First Amendment bar wrongful termination lawsuits when the employer is a religious group and the employee is one of the organization's ministers. The <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08mark.htm">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) [text] contains a "ministerial exception" that allows religious organizations to give "preference in employment to individuals of a particular religion" and to "require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets of such organization." The <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] and Cheryl Perich brought a claim against the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School alleging that the school had unlawfully terminated Perich in violation of the ADA because she was diagnosed with narcolepsy. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0065p-06.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the school violated the ADA and that the ministerial exception did not apply. In reversing the appeals court, Chief Justice John Roberts articulated the purpose of the ministerial exception:<blockquote>The members of a religious group put their faith in the hands of their ministers. Requiring a church to accept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving the church of control over the selection of those who will personify its beliefs. By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group's right to shape its own faith and mission through its appointments.</blockquote>The court ultimately concluded that the ministerial exception applied in Perich's case given the circumstances of her employment.

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to emphasize the deference courts must give to a "religious organization's good-faith understanding of who qualifies as its minister." The other justices implemented a fact-intensive analysis to determine whether the employee was a "minister" and therefore subject to the ministerial exception.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The brief argues that PPACA's expansion of Medicaid is so integral to the law itself that PPACA in its entirety should be nullified. The government predicts that the enrollment in Medicaid will increase by 16 million people by the end of 2020. The states allege that PPACA's new requirements eliminate the voluntary participation of states in the Medicaid program by taking away federal funding for non-participation. Therefore, states have no other alternative but to continue participating in Medicaid. The brief states:<blockquote>The scope of the federal government's power is much debated, but the fact that its powers are limited and enumerated is common ground to all. A judicial doctrine that implicitly or explicitly allows Congress to use the spending power without meaningful judicial supervision is simply not compatible with that basic premise of our system.</blockquote>The government's brief on the issue of Medicaid's expansion is due by February 10.

<p>On Saturday, the federal government filed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-government-defends-health-care-minimum-coverage-requirement.php">brief</a> [JURIST report] before the US Supreme Court arguing that the minimum coverage provision of the PPACA, which requires almost every US citizen to obtain health insurance by 2014 or face a tax penalty, is constitutional. The government is attempting to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/01/health-care-debate-reopens/#more-136085">keep the focus of the argument on health care reform as a whole</a> [SCOTUSblog report], rather than on the specific minimum coverage provision. The same group of 26 states filed a supporting brief arguing that the minimum coverage provision cannot be severed from the health care reform act without the entire system collapsing. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> to rule on health care reform law </a> [JURIST report] in three separate cases, reserving five-and-half-hours for oral argument on the issue. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Habre served as president of Chad from 1982 to 1990. Belgium alleges that, during that time, Habre was involved in the murder or torture of more than 40,000 political opponents. When he was ousted in 1990, he sought refuge in Senegal where he has resided ever since. Senegal placed Habre under arrest in 2005 after he was charged by Belgium. Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade said the rejection of the extradition request was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16526821">based on a procedural error</a> [BBC report]. The court did not receive original copies of the Belgian arrest warrant and other necessary documents, instead receiving photocopies. Wade said he expects the request for extradition to be granted once these procedural issues are resolved. 

<p>Senegal has been under pressure to send Habre to a country where he will face trial for his alleged war crimes committed during his rule of Chad. In July of last year, Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] its decision to send the former dictator back to Chad after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] warned he could be tortured. The decision came after Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued a plea</a> [JURIST report] not to return Habre to Chad, which has already sentenced him to death <em>in absentia</em> and where she fears he will be tortured. The plea from Pillay came just days after Senegal announced it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-to-deport-former-chad-president-habre.php">deporting Habre to Chad</a> [JURIST report] to face charges for war crimes. Belgium has long sought Habre's extradition under a universal jurisdiction law that allows Belgian courts to hear cases over violations of international law. In 2009, the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/icj-denies-belgium-request-to-force.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Belgium's request to compel Habre's extradition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Commission was set up by the Thai cabinet in 2010 to investigate the violence in the country. The TRCT asked that a senior member of the government be appointed to authorize criminal proceedings, instead of any member of the public, as is the case now. Despite attacks on the law within the country, as well as abroad from the US, EU and UN, Thailand's political parties have indicated that they will not reform the law. Opponents of the law claim that it has become a political tool used to limit free speech. In a <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZM3-a02P8XoKcRj_m9b6gRjsArw?docId=CNG.509cc67ecd5664ef688db11c9d28d284.801">letter to the prime minister</a> [AFP report], the Commission requested that the punishments fit with public sentiment and be less harsh. The law is even drawing criticism from some with royal blood who, in a letter, requested the prime minister change the law. However, they did not specify how they wish the law to be changed.

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1016.pdf">Coleman v. Maryland Court of Appeals</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">report</a>] the court will determine whether Congress constitutionally abrogated states' <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxi">Eleventh Amendment</a> [text] immunity when it passed the self-care leave provision of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/">Family and Medical Leave Act</a> (FMLA) [DOL backgrounder]. Petitioner Daniel Coleman was terminated from his job at the Maryland Court of Appeals and filed suit under Title VII and FMLA seeking money damages. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/091582.P.pdf">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court ruling that dismissed petitioner's FMLA clams as barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity. Counsel for the petitioner argued that Congress passed the self-care leave provision in an effort to protect women from employment discrimination by giving all employees, men included, equal right to leave. The state asserted that the self-care leave provision's purposes are not sufficiently in line with the Equal Protection Clause to overcome states' sovereign immunity.

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1399.pdf">Roberts v. Sea-Land Services</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-adds-7-cases-to-2011-docket.php">report</a>] the court will clarify when the period for compensation is under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_33_10_18.html">Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act</a> [text], which goes into effect after a worker is disabled on the job. The calculation for compensation is based on several factors, including the national average wage. Dana Roberts was disabled for a period between 2002 and 2005, but her claim was not adjudicated until 2007. Roberts argues that the national average wage when her claim was first adjudicated and decided in 2007 should be used, as opposed to the national average wage from 2002 when she was injured. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/11/10/08-70268.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Roberts misinterpreted the phrase "those newly awarded compensation during such period" and held that her compensation should be calculated based on the 2002 national average. The oral arguments focus on the ambiguity of the word "award," which counsel for the petitioner maintains is the compensation resulting from an administrative compensation order. The state argued that it would not make sense to compensate an employee who has not received an administrative order differently that one who has.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Colwell on Sunday <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/colwell_email_on_attorney-client_communication_monitoring_at_guantanamo.pdf">ordered</a> [e-mail, PDF] attorneys under his command not to comply with <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/gitmo_orders_20111227.pdf">rules</a> [text, PDF] requiring military officials to review all legal correspondence between lawyers and the detainees accused of involvement in the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 terror attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The rules were <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/guantanamo-rule-change-to-require-review-of-attorney-letters.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] in December by Navy rear Adm. <a href="http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/xWEBSITE/command/cdr.html">David Woods</a> [official profile], commander of the prison facility. Colwell's e-mail informed all military commission defense lawyers that they are ethically obligated to refuse to follow the rules: "These orders compel you to unlawfully reveal information related to the representation of a client in violation of <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information.html">Rule for Professional Conduct 1.6(a)</a>" [text] which addresses the confidentiality in a client-attorney relationship. He went on to advise all attorneys not to submit their acknowledgement of the rules, and if they had already done so, to withdraw that acknowledgement immediately. The new rules would require all correspondence to the five detainees to undergo a security review by officials from law enforcement and the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website]. The detainees, whose arraignment is anticipated to occur in 2012, include <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12964158">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Khalid+Sheikh+Mohammed">news archive</a>]. 

<p>Lawyers for detainees at Guantanamo have previously raised concerns with practices used at the prison. Last November, lawyers complained specifically about the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/jurist-lawyers-charged-with-defending.php">infringement on attorney-client privilege</a> [JURIST report] in a letter directed to the attention of the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs. The attorneys alleged that those working with the Joint Task Force Guantanamo [JTF-GTMO) seize, open, interpret, read and review attorney-client privileged communications, actions which the attorneys argued are unlawful. The five detainees have been held at Guantanamo since 2006 when they were transferred there from the custody of the US <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA). Last April, Attorney General <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Eric Holder</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">announced that the trials</a> [JURIST report] for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four other detainees are set to be held before a military commission. This was a change from Holder's previous position to <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/holder-announces-federal-trials-for.php">conduct the trials in federal civilian court</a> [JURIST report].

Both cases involve individuals detained by the US with the knowledge of British agents. Neither of the detainees has alleged that British agents were directly involved in the mistreatment. The statement reported that there was not sufficient evidence to legally establish complicity to torture. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7870387.stm">Binyam Mohamed</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=binyam+mohamed">news archive</a>], a British citizen and one of the alleged victims in this case, claimed in 2009 that the <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/guantanamo-ex-detainee-claims-memos.php">British government was aware of and involved in his mistreatment</a> [JURIST report] by US officials. The DPP and MPS stressed that their decision applies only to the two cases at hand, and other allegations of complicity by British agents in the torture of detainees will continue to be investigated:<blockquote>[These cases] involve specific allegations about specific conduct. The question that has therefore been addressed in these cases is whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of a criminal conviction against an identified individual in relation to these specific matters. The investigations have not examined wider allegations of ill-treatment, which, it is anticipated, will be examined by the Detainee Inquiry, chaired by Sir Peter Gibson. Nor have the investigations covered other specific allegations of ill-treatment beyond those raised in [these cases]. Should further evidence in relation to the matters raised...become available as a result of the Detainee Inquiry, the MPS would consider re-opening these operations.</blockquote>Last week, the MPS decided to immediately begin the investigation of two similar cases in Libya, and will investigate other allegations "in due course." 

<p>Last August, 10 human rights groups said they would <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/rights-group-boycotting-uk-detainee-torture-inquiry.php">boycott the UK government inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into allegations of torture complicity after receiving information on the protocol and transparency of the inquiry. They argued the inquiry would not comply with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF].

Only a day after the group's leader promised further attacks against Nigerian citizens, Pillay called specifically on the country's religious leaders to come together and "speak with one voice" in order to prevent future violence:<blockquote>One day it is a church congregation that is being targeted, the next day it is a mosque, and the day after that it is some secular target. The religious tolerance that has been a central tenet of Nigeria's Federation is being threatened, and I urge all Nigeria's leaders to avoid falling into the trap of calling for, or sanctioning, retaliation or making other provocative statements. Everybody will be the loser if Boko Haram succeeds in its aim and efforts to sow discord between Muslim and Christian, or pit Northerner against Southerner. The fact that people are already leaving some areas where they are in a minority, out of fear of attacks by the majority, shows just how dangerous this is becoming for the country as a whole.</blockquote>Emphasizing the importance of human rights, Pillay further stated that Boko Haram's attacks against civilians on grounds of religion or ethnicity could be crimes against humanity, and reminded Nigerian authorities to observe human rights and transparency during the course of their investigations. Said Pillay, "There must be no impunity for any acts of violence, including those committed in retaliation for earlier attacks."

<p>Boko Haram has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government and create an Islamic state, and has warned Christians in the mostly Muslim northern regions to leave the area. The group has been blamed by Nigerian authorities for hundreds of deaths in bombings and shooting over the last 18 months, and has publicly claimed responsibility for several of the attacks, including <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i4Vpsk9pJxwfvsGVSauUtxhi9puw?docId=CNG.08bf367b8562759d55ef1851220362a0.01">church bombings</a> [AP report] on December 25 that killed approximately 40 people.

The court upheld the <a href="http://www.adalah.org/features/famuni/20030731fam_uni_law_eng.pdf">Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law</a> [text, PDF] in a 6-5 ruling, approving the <a href="http://www.adalah.org/features/famuni/20030731fam_uni_law_eng.pdf">original version</a> [text, PDF] from 2003 along with its amended versions from <a href="http://www.adalah.org/features/famuni/lawBill27jul05.pdf">2005</a> [text, PDF] and <a href="http://www.adalah.org/features/famuni/famuni-mar07-law.pdf">2007</a> [text, PDF, in Hebrew]. With its ruling the court again rejected the <a href="http://www.adalah.org/features/famuni/famuni-may07-p.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF in Hebrew] filed by <a href="http://www.adalah.org/">Adalah</a> [advocacy website], a civil rights group in Israel, arguing that the law is unconstitutional. The law denies citizenship and right to reside in Israel to Palestinian citizens from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/countries/menaregion/pages/psindex.aspx">Occupied Palestinian Territory</a> (OPT) [OHCHR materials] or from "enemy states" defined by the law including Syria, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq. As a result, it restricts Palestinian Arabs, citizens of Israel, from living with their spouse from these regions in Israel. The 2005 amendment allowed women over 25 and men over 35 to apply for temporary permits to live in Israel.
In 2006, Adalah had filed a petition against the original version of the law which was <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files_eng/03/520/070/a47/03070520.a47.pdf">rejected</a> [judgment, PDF] by the same court stating that the constitutionality issue does not cover citizens of other countries, especially countries which are considered enemies to Israel.

<p>Israeli government has been active in passing stricter laws this year. The Israeli <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/index.html">Knesset</a> [official website] <a href="http://paperchase/2012/01/israel-approves-new-law-to-deter-illegal-migrants.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday a bill that increases the penalties on illegal migrants in Israel and Israelis helping them. Penalties may include arrest and detainment in prison for indefinite time period without trial. The government also <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-use-of-nazi-symbolism.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that bans the use of Nazi symbolism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Canada: same-sex marriages of non-residents not valid</title>

This means that couples who came to Canada since 2004 to get married are not legally wed. The reversal is policy came to light when a lesbian couple who were wed in Toronto filed for divorce. They were told that they are not able to divorce because they were never legally married. The <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/index.html">Canadian Department of Justice</a> [official website] stated that such marriages are invalid and cannot be dissolved unless the couple's home country acknowledges same-sex marriage. After creating confusion based on this statement, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson gave an <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2012/doc_32692.html">additional statement</a> [news release] that he "will be looking at options to clarify the law so that such marriages performed in Canada can be undone in Canada." The government's stand has been criticized by many, including former prime minister <a href="http://www.paulmartin.ca/">Paul Martin</a> [advocacy website] who said, "[w]e validated those marriages and you cannot retroactively invalidate marriages that you validated."

<p>Although same-sex marriage is recognized across Canada, various provinces have interpreted rights in different ways. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.albertacourts.ab.ca/CourtofQueensBench/tabid/69/Default.aspx">Queen's Court Bench of Alberta</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/canada-court-expands-rights-of-gay-non-biological-parents.php">granted custody</a> [JURIST report] of a child to a non-biological father who was a ex-partner of the biological father. In January, the <a href="http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/default.asp?pg=court_of_appeal">Saskatchewan Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/canada-appeals-court-refusal-to-marry-same-sex-couples-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that refusal by provincial marriage commissioners to marry same-sex couples is unconstitutional and thereby invalidated a proposed amendment to Saskatchewan's Marriage act of 1995 that would have allowed the commissioners to refuse to marry same-sex couples  based on their religious beliefs.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Czeslaw Kiszczak Thursday. The court found Kiszczak guilty <em>in absentia</em> in relation to the implementation of <a href="http://en.poland.gov.pl/Martial,Law,7310.html">martial law</a> [Polish government backgrounder] in 1981. Martial law was declared on December 13, 1981, by <a href="http://www.wojciech-jaruzelski.pl/">Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> [personal website, in Polish], who was declared too sick to stand trial, in an attempt to squelch the <a href="http://www.solidarity.gov.pl/">Solidarity movement</a> [official website], an opposition group. This caused thousands of people to be illegally detained as well about 100 people to be killed. Kiszczak's sentence will be suspended for five years. 

<p>This trial has been going on for <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/poland-ex-leaders-go-on-trial-for.php">more than three years</a> [JURIST report] and involves many of the Polish leaders in 1981, including Gen.

The trial hit several snags between 2008 and 2011, with both the death of the presiding judge and Jaruzelski's own failing health having delayed the proceedings for several years.<br />

Obama used recess appointments to install <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/who-is-richard-cordray-and-what-is-he-going-to-do/2012/01/04/gIQAV4EraP_blog.html">Richard Cordray</a> [WP backgrounder] as director of the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Finance Protection Bureau</a> [official website] and appoint three other individuals to the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a> [official website]. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section2">Recess Appointment Clause</a> [Constitution, Article II, &#167; 2 text] gives the president the "power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate." The DOJ's memo argues that although the Senate met between January 3 and 23, the sessions were not sufficient to constitute an interruption of a recess under the Recess Appointment Clause because they were only <em>pro forma</em> sessions that lasted less than a minute and there was no intent to conduct any business. Since the sessions were so short, the memo concludes that "the President therefore has discretion to conclude that the Senate is unavailable to perform its advise-and-consent function and to exercise his power to make recess appointments."

<p>Obama has been <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/01/12/whitewash-on-illegal-appointments-wont-work/">criticized</a> [Heritage Foundation report] by the right for the recess appointments as an unconstitutional extension of presidential power. <a href="http://www.grassley.senate.gov/">Chuck Grassley</a> (R-IA) [official website] stated that Obama's use of recess appointments <a href="http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=38462">"ignore[s] more than 90 years of legal precedent"</a> [press release]. Some experts argue that recess appointments have <a href="/forum/2011/12/victor-williams-recess-appointments.php">regularly been used by presidents</a> [JURIST op-ed] since George Washington. It is only a relatively recent practice that obstructionists have begun holding perfunctory <em>pro forma</em> sessions every three days while the Senate is on recess in order to block recess appointments. In 2005 then-president <a href="/currentawareness/georgew.php">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] used recess appointments to name <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/bush-announces-recess-appointment-for.php">Alice Fisher</a> to the top post in the DOJ's criminal division, <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/bush-makes-second-recess-appointment.php">Peter Flory</a> as an Assistant Secretary of Defense and <a href="/paperchase/2005/08/breaking-news-bush-naming-bolton-as-us.php">John Bolton</a> [JURIST reports] as US Ambassador to the UN.

The court ruled that many parliamentary deputies <a href="http://en.rian.ru/world/20120112/170726637.html">violated the secrecy of the voting procedure</a> [RIA Novosti report] by showing their ballots to TV cameras to show their support of parliamentary speaker and acting president Marian Lupu. Lupu fell three votes shy of the 61 votes required for election, out of 101 deputies. Moldova has been without an official president since 2009.

<p>Moldova's main political parties, the pro-EU party and the Communist Party, have been deadlocked since Moldova's last president, Vladimir Voronin, <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/Acting_Moldovan_President_Voronin_Reportedly_Resigns/1812942.html">resigned</a> [RFE/RL report] in September 2009.

Voronin, leader of the opposition Communist Party, stated that he refuses to support Lupu but indicated that Moldova could end the deadlock by voting for a non-parliamentary, non-partisan candidate. In April 2009 the Moldovan Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/moldova-constitutional-court-confirms.php">confirmed controversial election results</a> [JURIST report] which gave the Communist Party 60 of the 101 parliament seats, after it had <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/moldova-constitutional-court-orders.php">ordered a recount</a> [JURIST report] after accusations of falsified voter registration rolls.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That section would have required Internet Service Providers (ISP) to block any foreign website suspected of copyright infringement. The bill is aimed at expanding the power of the United States <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) and holders of copyrights to stop the spread of copyright infringement and counterfeit goods through the Internet. If the bill passes, the DOJ and copyright holders will be allowed to obtain court orders requiring advertising agencies and others who use a site's services to stop payments to the accused site. In regards to the bill, Smith said:<blockquote>We will continue to look for ways to ensure that foreign websites cannot sell and distribute illegal content to U.S. consumers. Current law protects the rights of American innovators by prohibiting the illegal sale and distribution of their products by domestic websites.  But there is no equivalent protection for American companies from foreign online criminals who steal and sell American goods to consumers around the world. Congress must address the widespread problem of online theft of America's technology and products from foreign thieves.</blockquote>Many well-known websites have voiced their opposition to the bill. Earlier this week, popular social news site <a href = "http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> [website] announced it will <a href="http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html">shut down its site</a> [press release] for twelve hours in protest to the bill. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57349540-281/sopa-opponents-may-go-nuclear-and-other-2012-predictions/">Reports have also suggested</a> [CNet report] that other Internet sites such as <a href = "http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href = "http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href = "http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and <a href = "http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/corporate/index.html">Google</a> [websites] are also considering "blackouts" in order to stop the bill's momentum. The Obama administration also <a href = "https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petition-tool/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internet">came out against provisions of SOPA</a> [press release] on Saturday.

<p>Recently, there has been a surge in government attention to copyright issues. Earlier this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-adopts-strict-anti-piracy-law.php">Spanish government approved a new law</a> [JURIST report] that creates a government agency with the authority to force Internet service providers to block certain websites that are involved in pirating copyrighted material.  The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in November that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/ecj-rules-isps-not-required-to-monitor-user-activity-for-filesharing.php">ISPs cannot be required by law to monitor</a> [JURIST report] their customers' activities as an attempt to combat illegal sharing of copyrighted material. In October, the US Supreme Court considered the issue of foreign copyrights in the case of <span class = "casename">Golan v. Holder</span> when it considered arguments to determine the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-ministerial-exception-uraa.php">copyright status of foreign works</a> [JURIST report] that used to be in the public domain. A judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that a music file-sharing site could be held <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-rules-online-music-site-could-be-liable-for-infringement.php">liable for contributory copyright infringement</a> [JURIST report] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

She stated that prison officials have <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/13/BARG1MP944.DTL">failed to comply with her ruling in a 1994 suit</a> [<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> report] that required prisons to provide assistance for disabled inmates. Prison officials argued that the mobility assistance devices could be used as weapons and that they are not responsible for disabled inmates. Wilken ruled that as it is the state's decision to revoke parole, must protect disabled parolees' legal rights when they are confined. She also held that prison officials had to provide wheelchairs and chains, could not deny inmates the right to file and grievances and could not exclude disabled inmates form drug treatment programs.

<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22us+supreme+court%22">news archive</a>] ruled in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1233">Brown v. Plata</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-california-prison-population-reduction-order.php">report</a>] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">uphold an order</a> [JURIST report] requiring California to release up to 46,000 prisoners to remedy the state's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+prison">overcrowded prisons</a> [JURIST news archive]. Counsel for the state of California argued that the "extraordinary and unprecedented order ... requiring the release of between 36,000 and 45,000 inmates ... is extraordinarily premature." Counsel for the prisoners argued that the court must allow the lower court to provide a remedy for 20 years of overcrowding that has violated inmates' constitutional rights. The California prison system was operating at nearly 200 percent capacity. The three-judge panel, whose decision was upheld by the Supreme Court, ordered California to reduce the population by 46,000 inmates to be under 137.5 percent institutional capacity within two years. California <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/california-submits-plan-to-reduce-prison-population-to-meet-court-order.php">submitted a plan</a> [JURIST report] to comply with the court order and relieve prison overcrowding in June. As of January, California has reduced its prison population by <a href = "http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/News/docs/Jan-2012-Pop-Status-Update.pdf">11,000 prisoners</a> [report to court, PDF] and is now operating at 167 percent capacity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In an interview published by the Lebanese Newspaper <a href="http://www.annahar.com/index.php?type=main&table=main&day=Sat">An-Nahar</a> [official website], Clinton reiterated US support for Lebanon and noted that the work of the STL is "legitimate and necessary." She also stressed the independence of the tribunal and that "no one knows what the Special Tribunal is going to do, who it might indict, or when it might choose to move forward." Clinton's interview followed remarks made by Hezbollah leader <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5176612.stm">Hassan Nasrallah</a> [BBC profile], who said he would "cut off the hands" of any person attempting to arrest a Hezbollah member in connection with the murder.

The controversy came to light when a non-resident lesbian couple who were wed in Toronto filed for divorce. They were told that they were not able to divorce because they were never legally married. Nicholson claimed the controversy over the law was <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/justice-minister-declares-all-same-sex-marriages-legal-and-valid/article2301691/">due to a gap</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] in the Civil Marriage Act which he says will be remedied to resolve the issue. According to Nicholson, the Act will be changed so that all marriages performed in Canada will be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/13/us-marriage-idUSTRE80B20U20120113">legally recognized in the country</a> [Reuters report]. Nicholson also indicated that the government has no intention of reopening the debate on the definition of marriage. An estimated 5,000 foreign same-sex weddings have been performed in Canada since 2003, when the first Canadian provinces began allowing same-sex marriage.  

<p>Although same-sex marriage is recognized across Canada, various provinces have interpreted rights in different ways. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.albertacourts.ab.ca/CourtofQueensBench/tabid/69/Default.aspx">Queen's Court Bench of Alberta</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/canada-court-expands-rights-of-gay-non-biological-parents.php">granted custody</a> [JURIST report] of a child to a non-biological father who was an ex-partner of the biological father. In January, the <a href="http://www.sasklawcourts.ca/default.asp?pg=court_of_appeal">Saskatchewan Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/canada-appeals-court-refusal-to-marry-same-sex-couples-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that refusal by provincial marriage commissioners to marry same-sex couples is unconstitutional and thereby invalidated a proposed amendment to Saskatchewan's Marriage Act of 1995 that would have allowed the commissioners to refuse to marry same-sex couples based on their religious beliefs. Canada <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/canadian-senate-approves-gay-marriage.php">legalized same-sex</a> [JURIST report] marriage in 2005 with the passage of the Civil Marriage Act.  <br />

In his speech, Ban indicated that it is time for Assad to <a href="http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16149597">usher in democracy</a> [SkyNews report] and recognize that the days of one-man rule and perpetual family dynasties are ending.

In his statement Ban acknowledged that the path to democracy may be difficult, but indicated that Arab nations must move forward in their democratic efforts. Ban's remarks addressing the situation in Syria came as Assad <a href="http://www.sana.sy/eng/21/2012/01/15/394326.htm">released a statement</a> [SANA report] granting amnesty for crimes including peaceful demonstration, carrying or possessing unlicensed firearms, and evasion of military service, which occurred between March 15, 2011 and January 15, 2012. 

<p>Earlier this month, as part of an agreement with the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic], Syria <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/syria-releases-more-than-500-prisoners-as-part-of-arab-league-agreement.php">released</a> [JURIST report] more than 500 prisoners. Last month, Ban <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-condemns-escalating-syrian-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] leaders of the Syrian government and violent protesters for the continuous bloodshed within the country. Also last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/hrw-says-syria-officials-ordered-civilian-attacks-calls-for-icc-investigation.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that Syrian army commanders and officials have ordered troops to attack unarmed protesters as part of an effort to stop public demonstrations. The violence in Syria has also been condemned by the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-council-condemns-violence-in-syria.php">UN Human Rights Council</a>, the UN General Assembly's <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-body-passes-resolution-condemning-syria-violence.php">Human Rights Committee</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-arab-league-denounce-syria-violence.php">Arab League</a> [JURIST reports].

The <a  href = "http://www.nrtw.org">National Right to Work Foundation</a> (NRWF) and the <a href = "http://www.nfib.com">National Federation of Independent Business</a> (NFIB) [advocacy websites] contend that the recess appointments are not constitutional as the Senate was technically in a <em>pro forma</em> session, thus providing no recess during which Obama could make appointments. The motions were filed in relation to the groups' ongoing suit challenging the <a href = "http://www.nlrb.gov">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) [official website] mandate that <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/nlrb-orders-union-rights-posted-in-us-businesses.php">rights to unionize</a> [JURIST report] be posted in all workplaces. In a press release, the NFIB also stated that they have <a href = "http://www.nfib.com/nfib-on-the-move/nfib-on-the-move-item?cmsid=59160">amended their complaint</a> [text] to include new charges that the NLRB cannot function to enforce new rules, in part due to Obama's recess appointments:<blockquote>The President's action was a surprise and terrible disappointment to small-business owners throughout the country who have suffered under the unabashedly pro-union rule-makings handed down by the NLRB. These alleged recess appointments are a brazen circumvention of the Congressional appointment process and raise serious legal concerns that cannot be ignored. The outrage amongst members of the small-business community is severe, and NFIB takes this action today to ensure that its members are protected from unconstitutional acts that exacerbate the NLRB's devolution from a neutral arbiter between labor and employers to a pro-union government agency.</blockquote>Earlier this month, Obama used recess appointments to install <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/who-is-richard-cordray-and-what-is-he-going-to-do/2012/01/04/gIQAV4EraP_blog.html">Richard Cordray</a> [WP backgrounder] as director of the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Finance Protection Bureau</a> [official website] and <a href = "http://www.nlrb.gov/news/new-board-members-take-office-announce-chief-counsels">appointed</a> [press release] Sharon Block, Terence F. Flynn and Richard F. Griffin as new board members for the NLRB. 

<p>The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] defended the use of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%270DP%2BP\W%3B%20P%20%20%0A">recess appointments</a> [CRS backgrounder, PDF] by Obama immediately after his announcement. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section2">Recess Appointment Clause</a> [Constitution, Article II, &#167; 2 text] gives the president the "power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate." The DOJ's memo argues that although the Senate met between January 3 and 23, the sessions were not sufficient to constitute an interruption of a recess under the Recess Appointment Clause because they were only <em>pro forma</em> sessions that lasted less than a minute and there was no intent to conduct any business. Some experts argue that recess appointments have <a href="/forum/2011/12/victor-williams-recess-appointments.php">regularly been used by presidents</a> [JURIST op-ed] since George Washington. It is only a relatively recent practice that obstructionists have begun holding perfunctory <em>pro forma</em> sessions every three days while the Senate is on recess in order to block recess appointments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If passed, the amendments would allow both houses of the National Assembly to monitor one another, as well as minister and cabinet appointments, whereas before this was the sole province of the King and Prime Minister. The speech also suggested new economic powers for the National Assembly, designed to allow the bodies to pass emergency budgets expediently. Al Khalifa did not explicitly reference any of the recent protests in Bahrain, instead commending his country's commitment to democracy and asking that dissenters pursue lawful solutions:<blockquote>We cannot fail at this point to emphasize that democracy is not just literature, or constitutional and legislative provisions. Democracy is a culture and practice, commitment to the rule of law, respect for the international principles of human rights, coupled with serious national political action that represents all spectrums of society without exclusion or quotas. In parallel with this crucial step that we take today, we call for other important steps to be made to reinforce the democratic culture and practice on the land of our beloved country. Furthermore, we call upon all segments of society&#8212;the community and the family&#8212;to work together to ensure that our young people respect the law. This is a responsibility that must be shouldered by all, especially when respect for the law is linked to the principles of coexistence, tolerance, harmony and love.</blockquote>Although several officials <a href = "http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/489299">praised the speech</a> [BNA report] and reforms, others were less impressed. Opposition group <a href = "http://alwefaq.net/">Al Wefaq</a> [advocacy website, in Arabic] <a href = "http://alwefaq.net/index.php?show=news&action=article&id=6142">rejected</a> [press release, in Arabic] the proposed reforms, stating that the government is continuing to ignore the will of the people and will only increase the tension and violence in the nation. The amendments were <a href = "http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/489210">referred to the Shura council</a> [BNA report] later on Sunday.

<p>Protests and demonstrations in <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14540571">Bahrain</a> [BBC backgrounder] have been <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/un-commissioner-urges-bahrain-to-respect-rights-of-demonstrators.php">ongoing since February 2011</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month, a Bahraini court on overturned the death sentences for two protesters convicted of killing two police officers during the demonstrations that took place in the country last year. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">original conviction</a> [JURIST report] was rendered by a special security court set up as part of the emergency law in place while the country's Sunni rulers attempted to silence a Shiite-led to effort bolster civil and political rights in the country. In December, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said that the Bahrain government should <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-bahrain-government-should-release-protestors-rebuild-trust.php">release prisoners detained during peaceful protests</a> [JURIST report] and focus on rebuilding national trust in the government.

The prime minister was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gJ7AfZ9Efqs3FthLCEX6BdSeHYzg?docId=4cbb70e0784245dc850b66b19b4183e2">ordered to appear in court Thursday</a> [AP report] to explain why he did not comply with the court's order to reopen a corruption case against <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website]. Last week, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/pakistan-high-court-warns-pm-to-comply-with-order-to-investigate-president.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] Gilani that failure to comply could result contempt charges and removal from office. The conflict between the prime minster and the court stems from an order which <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2009, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999. Gilani has not acted on the court's orders, maintaining that  the <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2012-01-10-AS-Pakistan/id-c9533ab352614bf782ccfe7d109811c8">president has immunity from prosecution</a> [AP report]. 

<p>These proceedings reflect an ongoing struggle between the government and the courts in Pakistan. Last month, the Supreme Court formed a judicial committee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/pakistan-supreme-court-to-investigate-memo-scandal.php">investigate a secret memo</a> [JURIST report] sent from an unknown Pakistani source to US Admiral Mike Mullen in May asking for help in preventing a suspected army coup. Zardari and former Pakistan ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani have been accused of writing or having knowledge of the memo, and both have denied these allegations. In October, the Supreme Court issued a judgment <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/pakistan-top-judge-orders-political-parties-to-cut-ties-with-%20criminal-gangs.php">urging political parties to stop financing criminal groups</a> [JURIST report] responsible for increased violence in the city of Karachi. The decision stated that militant groups have gained strength because of support from local political groups and ordered the Pakistani government to help address the corruption. The court struck down the NRO in 2009, which was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by former Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4797762.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile] in 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 90-page report, which addresses human rights issues throughout the world, dedicates 20 pages to the situation in the US, and calls the situation in Guantanamo "the main outstanding [human rights] issue" in the US. The report also alleged growing racial discrimination problems, unacceptable prison conditions and erosion of citizens' rights:<blockquote>Longstanding systematic problems of the American society are aggravating, such as racial discrimination, xenophobia, overcrowded prisons, unreasoned use of death penalties, in particular with respect to innocent, minor and mentally disabled persons, as well as flawed electoral system and corruption. There has been a sharp worsening of situation concerning the fulfillment of basic social and economic rights of citizens, including collective bargaining rights. Permanent deficits of federal and local budgets revealed gaps in the judicial system, including inadequate access to justice.</blockquote>The report criticizes <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/barackobama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] for revising his stance on <a href="/hotline/2011/11/wells-dixon-guantanamo-dysfunction.php">Guantanamo prison</a> [JURIST comment], and failing to expand basic human rights during his presidency. In addition to the US, the report addresses human rights concerns in Germany, France, Great Britain, Poland, Canada and other states. 

<p>This report marks the first time that the MFA has issued a statement regarding the state of affairs of human rights in other countries, although Russia has been criticized internationally and by its own citizens for its human rights record. In December, the Russian Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/russia-rights-council-condemns-khodorkovsky-conviction.php">called for the annulment</a> [JURIST report] of the conviction of ex-oil tycoon <a href="http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about-khodorkovsky-and-lebedev/about-khodorkovsky">Mikhail Khodorkovsky</a> [defense website; JURIST <a href=/jurist_search.php?q=Mikhail+Khodorkovsky">news archive</a>]. Also in December, Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian] ordered an <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/russia-president-orders-probe-into-election-fraud-allegations.php">investigation into allegations of fraud</a> [JURIST report] in recent parliamentary elections. Earlier, the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website] issued <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/international-election-fraud-monitor-concerned-about-russia-election-process.php">preliminary findings</a> [JURIST report] that the Russian election was "characterized by frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulation." The <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a> [official website] and other world leaders have also called for an investigation into the allegations of election fraud and expressed concern over "harassment" of election monitoring groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the reforms urged include ending the state of emergency, reforming police law and expanding freedom of expression. In the report, HRW said:<blockquote>Over the past year, Egyptians have experienced many of the same human rights abuses that characterized Mubarak's police state. Under the leadership of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), excessive use of force, torture, attacks on peaceful protests, and arbitrary arrests of peaceful protesters, bloggers, and journalists have become commonplace and illustrate how little has changed. Ending these abuses will only occur when there is political will to break with the past and truly reform the country's oppressive machinery.</blockquote>The report also prescribes strengthening the criminal penalties for police abuse, amending Egypt's definition of torture to be in line with international standards and allowing independent NGOs to operate lawfully in the country.

<p>In November HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/rights-group-urges-egypt-prosecutors-to-release-blogger.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian government to release <a href="http://www.manalaa.net/">Alaa Abd El Fattah</a> [blog; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alaa">Twitter feed</a>], a blogger and activist who engaged in protests and accused the SCAF of committing abuses.

Abu Qatada is a Palestinian-Jordanian Islamic scholar who fled the Middle East under persecution to London in 1993, where he was granted political asylum. The ECHR has blocked deportation on the grounds that the evidence of his involvement in two terrorist conspiracies had been obtained by Jordanian authorities by torturing one of Qatada's co-defendants, and there is widespread use of torture evidence by Jordanian courts. The UK government has been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16594683">trying to deport Qatada</a> [BBC report] since 2005, but he maintains that in Jordan he will face extended confinement, an unfair trial, and perhaps torture:<blockquote>[Qatada] argued that his high profile would mean he would be of real interest to the Jordanian authorities. If returned, he would also face retrial for the offences for which he had been convicted <em>in absentia</em>. He would thus face lengthy pre-trial detention ... and, if convicted, would face a long term of imprisonment. All these factors meant he was at real risk of torture, either pre-trial or after conviction, to obtain a confession from him or to obtain information for other reasons. ... [H]e alleged that his retrial would be flagrantly unfair: the State Security Court, a military court, lacked independence from the executive and there was a real risk that evidence obtained by torture&#8212;either of him, his co-defendants or other prisoners&#8212;would be admitted against him.</blockquote>The ECHR denied the other claims and blocked deportation based only on a finding of real risk of admission at Qatada's retrial of evidence obtained by torture of third persons.

<p>Qatada was granted political asylum by the UK in 1994. When he was arrested in 2001 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1989, police seized a sizable sum of money in various currencies for which no explanation was given. Later in 2001, he went into hiding to avoid being arrested and detained under the then-proposed Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. He was arrested again in 2002 and held until March 2005 when he was released pursuant to a House of Lords judgment declaring his detention without trial to be unlawful. In February 2009 the ECHR ordered the UK to pay <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/europe-rights-court-orders-uk-to.php">&#163;2,500 in damages</a> [JURIST report] to Qatada after determining that his imprisonment violated the <a href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=005&CL=ENG">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [official website]. Despite his previous grant of asylum and fears of torture and persecution, UK Law Lords in February 2009 ruled that Qatada <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-rules-muslim-cleric-can-be.php">could be returned</a> [JURIST report] to Jordan to face terrorism charges. The February decision overruled an April 2008 Court of Appeal decision <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-appeals-court-blocks-terror.php">blocking his deportation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bormes</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fosg%2Fbriefs%2F2011%2F2pet%2F7pet%2F2011-0192.pet.aa.pdf&ei=oaAVT673DYTX0QH1yeidAw&usg=AFQjCNHF2m2wROcd0NK5ehdfvPY6vM1MGg&sig2=GPIHW7Rs5fG49S8EdAvsDg">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether the federal government has sovereign immunity for damages arising from the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CF4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ftc.gov%2Fos%2Fstatutes%2F031224fcra.pdf&ei=f6UVT8bDPOPr0gGUo_yRAw&usg=AFQjCNFuAtXmfAcFofNRWi5MCc_SOoE32A&sig2=kcMjtGh1NkOxyKCou0NJUQ">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA) [text, PDF]. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in 2010 that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/tucker_act">Little Tucker Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1545224.html">waived sovereign immunity</a> [opinion] for money claims against the US under the FCRA. Lawyer James Bormes filed the class action lawsuit after realizing that portions of his and others' private credit card information displayed on a government website following payment of federal court fees. Bormes claims that the disclosure of private credit card information violates the FCRA and is seeking damages against the government on behalf of the class.

<p>The court agreed Friday to rule in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-184.htm">Kloeckner v. Solis</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCgQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cocklelaw.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F08%2F25207-pdf-Schnapper-I.pdf&ei=QqEVT960M8Lk0QGtsryyAw&usg=AFQjCNF98h8qZyRfv3DRiTfvzTeKErgt9w&sig2=ATOmmhw3Z9jFx5-cXY1tPQ">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine appellate jurisdiction in wrongful termination and discrimination cases for federal employees. The court will determine whether a party may appeal a case involving both wrongful termination and discrimination claims to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a district court, when the <a href="http://www.mspb.gov/">Merit Systems Protection Board</a> (MSPB) [official website], which hears cases involving federal employees, decides the case without determining the merits of a discrimination claim. The confusion arises from provisions in the <a href="http://www.opm.gov/biographyofanideal/PU_CSreform.htm">Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</a> [text] that place cases involving discrimination in district courts. The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Opbelow_Kloeckner.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] last year that because the MSPB did not address the merits of the employee's discrimination claim, the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction over the appeal. </p>

<p>The court also agreed to rule in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-465.htm">Cavazos v. Williams</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Williams-Cert-Petition-11-465.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether a petitioner's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/habeas_corpus"><em>habeas corpus</em></a> [LII backgrounder] claim has been properly decided on its merits when a state court denies the claim without acknowledging a federal law basis for the claim in its opinion. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled last year that Tara Williams' <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2011/05/23/07-56127.pdf">imprisonment was unconstitutional</a> [opinion, PDF] because the court did not adjudicate the case on its merits when it failed to consider Williams' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] claim. Williams was sentenced to life in prison without parole on murder charges after the trial court dismissed a known holdout juror. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, the court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders%5C011712zor.pdf">granted</a> [order list, PDF] the addition of two parties in three separate cases concerning healthcare reform law: <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-398.htm">Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida</a>, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-393.htm">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a>, and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-400.htm">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [dockets]. The new parties are small business owners who oppose the federal individual insurance mandate and their addition will <a href="http://issuu.com/wsj.com/docs/healthlaw0104.pdf">avoid a possible standing dispute</a> [motion, PDF] since the original small business owner in the case recently filed for bankruptcy. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the cases in November to determine the constitutionality of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>]. All three cases arose out of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled in August that the individual insurance mandate is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional but severable</a> [JURIST report], upholding the rest of the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Abdulla Mohamed was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/maldives-military-arrests-senior-judge-who-declared-opposition-leaders-detention-illegal/2012/01/17/gIQAnWsq4P_story.html">arrested for corruption</a> [WP report] in an unprecedented move by the military that has sparked street protests and prompted all the country's courts to boycott sessions. Opposition activists claim the arrest was made in retaliation for the judge's ruling a day earlier that opposition leader Mohamed Jameel Ahmed was being illegally detained under an old criminal defamation law that is not part of the current democratic law established in 2008. The country's prosecutor general's office has said that under the constitution a judge can be arrested only after a supreme court decision to do so. The supreme court, the prosecutor general's office and judicial services commission all issued statements calling the judge's arrest illegal and requesting his release. At least 200 protesters gathered Tuesday near the police and military headquarters demanding adherence to court orders and release of the arrested judge, but police and soldiers used batons to disperse them.

<p>The Maldives has faced ongoing political difficulties following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/maldives-president-signs-new.php">adoption of its constitution</a> [JURIST report] in late 2008. <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/4/?ref=2,8,0">President Mohamed Nasheed</a> [official website] defeated longtime political opponent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7658672.stm">Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</a> [BBC profile], who had jailed him numerous times during his 30-year rule. However, opposition legislators have blocked the ruling party's legislative agenda, leaving certain crucial provisions of the new constitutional system unestablished. This resulted in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10452297">resignation of Nasheed's entire cabinet</a> [BBC report] in June 2010. The <a href="http://www.maldivesinfo.gov.mv/home/upload/downloads/Compilation.pdf">Maldives Constitution</a> [text, PDF] provides for multi-party elections, an independent judiciary and grants more authority to the legislature. It also enumerates fundamental rights of citizens and establishes several special commissions on issues relating to human rights and corruption. The new constitution was drafted in response to <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/publications/AmnestyReport.pdf">international criticism</a> [AI report, PDF] of 2003 government actions against protesters of prison conditions in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontfrance.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A French judge has requested access to information from <a href="/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in order to investigate allegations of torture being made by three French citizens. Judge Sophie Clement requested access to documents, as well as access to individuals who had contact with the men during their arrest and detention by the US government. Clement is specifically seeking information relating to the <a href="http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/canada-in-afghanistan/Guantanamo+torture+French+citizens+judge+seeking+access/6007196/story.html">justification for the detention</a> [AFP report] of the men, who were all arrested in late 2001 near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. She is also asking for information related to US military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan that led to their arrest, as well as the treatment of the men during their arrest and detention. The men, Nizar Sassi, Mourad Benchellali and Khaled Ben Mustapha, claim to have been subject to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2012/01/17/french_judge_wants_to_investigate_at_guantanamo/">sexual abuse, beatings and sleep deprivation</a> [AP report] during their detention. The men were returned to France in 2004 and 2005, and were sentenced to one year in prison on terrorism charges in 2011. A lawyer for two of the men indicated that Clement's actions were unprecedented and that he was hopeful her actions would allow his clients to identify the individuals responsible for their detention and alleged torture.

<p>The US facility at Guantanamo Bay remains a controversial aspect of the US "war on terror," and numerous allegations of torture have been made by former prisoners, prompting multiple investigations. In April a Spanish judge announced that the Spanish National Court would <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-court-turns-over-guantanamo-torture-investigation-to-US.php">not investigate</a> [JURIST report] six Bush administration officials pursuant to torture claims from Guantanamo Bay after the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] provided a letter assuring Spain that the US is investigating the treatment of detainees and has already completed federal criminal prosecution for the detainee mistreatment. In February 2011, the Spanish National Court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/spain-court-allows-guantanamo-torture-investigation-to-continue.php">continue investigating</a> [JURIST report] allegations of a Moroccan man who claims that he was tortured while detained at Guantanamo Bay. The court first <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/spain-judge-opens-investigation-into.php">opened the investigation in April 2009</a> [JURIST report], looking into torture allegations at Guantanamo Bay made by four former prisoners. The court based its decision on statements by the prisoners who claimed they were subject to various forms of physical and mental abuse during their imprisonment, as well as <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/doj-releases-secret-cia-interrogation.php">CIA interrogation memos </a> [JURIST report] detailing a plan which allegedly authorized the systematic torture and mistreatment of persons who were deprived the basic rights of detainees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The sentence was less than the 10 years in prison and USD $6,330 fine sought by the prosecution. Naji was captured in 2002 near Kashmir and transferred to Guantanamo. In July 2010 the US <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/dod-announces-release-of-2-guantanamo-detainees.php">extradited him to Algeria</a> [JURIST report] after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/supreme-court-permits-guantanamo-detainees-return-to-algeria.php">declined to stop the transfer</a> [JURIST report].

The transfer was announced at a press conference by the ICTR's prosecutor <a href="http://www.unictr.org/AboutICTR/ICTRStructure/OfficeoftheProsecution/tabid/104/Default.aspx">Hassan Bubacar Jallow</a> and Rwanda's Prosecutor-General <a href="http://www.nppa.gov.rw/component/content/article/38-sports/94-prosecutor-general.html">Martin Ngoga</a> [official profiles]. The decision to transfer the prosecution materials demonstrates the ICTR's recognition of Rwanda's capability to provide genocide defendants a fair and effective justice system, according to Ngoga. Jallow also commented on behalf of the ICTR:<blockquote>The referral reflects our acknowledgement of the important advancements Rwanda has made in terms of law reform and capacity building within the justice system. With the assistance of donors, as well as the ICTR, these measures ensure that the legal system is consistent with international standards. With this renewed confidence in the capacity and robustness of Rwandan justice, we will encourage more cases to bereferred by the ICTR to Rwanda for trial.</blockquote>One of the measures taken by the Rwandan government to comply with ICTR's international standard of a fair and effective justice system was the <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/rwanda-senate-approves-death-penalty.php">abolition of death penalty</a> [JURIST report] in 2007. The ICTR had refused to deliver suspects of the 1994 genocide to the country while its death penalty was in effect.

<p>The case involves the prosecution of the former Rwandan pastor <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/10/498.html">Jean-Bosco Uwinkindi</a> [Hague Justice profile; <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=75&mnid=1">case materials</a>]. Six months after he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ictr-transfers-case-of-former-pastor-to-rwanda-court.php">transferred to Rwanda</a> [JURIST report] to be tried before its national court system under Rule 11 bis authorizing the transfer of cases to appropriate national jurisdictions, the ICTR last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ictr-upholds-decision-to-transfer-case-of-former-pastor-to-rwanda-court.php">rejected Uwinkindi's appeal</a> [JURIST report] upholding the decision of transfer. Uwinkindi was <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/Docs/Court%20Documents/ICTR/Uwinkindi_Indictment.pdf">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] in 2001 and has been accused of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. He was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rwanda-genocide-suspect-arrested-in-uganda.php">arrested</a> in July 2010 by Ugandan authorities and <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/former-rwanda-pastor-pleads-not-guilty-to-genocide-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court announced in October that <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/spain-former-judge-to-face-trial-for-illegal-wiretap-order.php">Garzon would stand trial</a> on the charges after the he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-high-court-indicts-judge-garzon-for-jailhouse-wiretap-order.php">indicted in April</a> [JURIST reports] for ordering the placement of wiretaps in jailhouses to record conversations between inmates and their lawyers. Garzon gave the order as part of an investigation into a network of businesses that allegedly gave money and gifts to members of Spain's Popular Party in exchange for government contracts. Garzon is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16591685">facing a private prosecution</a> [BBC report], which is permitted by Spanish law, after Spanish prosecutors asked that all charges against the former judge be dropped. The prosecution is being pursued by lawyers who had jailhouse conversations with their clients recorded by the wiretaps. They allege that Garzon <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/17/world/europe/spain-judge-trial/?hpt=hp_t3">violated their constitutional rights</a> [CNN report] and exceeded his judicial authority by ordering the wiretaps. Garzon was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-judicial-panel-suspends-judge-garzon-over-franco-probe.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] by the General Council of the Judiciary in 2010 for abusing his power by opening an investigation into war crimes allegedly committed under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a> [BBC backgrounder] during the Spanish Civil War. He faces a second private prosecution related to the <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">abuse of power charges</a> [JURIST report], which is scheduled to begin next week. 

<p>In March, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/spain-judge-garzon-petitions-europe-rights-court-over-franco-probe.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging the 2010 charges of abuse of power. In that case, Garzon is charged with politically motivated corruption in his investigation of crimes committed under the Franco dictatorship, in violation of the 1977 Amnesty Law, which affords amnesty for Franco-era crimes. The charges are based on Garzon's 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">order</a> [JURIST report] for certain government agencies, the Episcopal Conference, the University of Granada and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves, as well as the circumstances and dates of their burial. His petition follows the September 2010 decision of the Criminal Chamber of the Spanish Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/spain-high-court-confirms-decision-against-judge-garzon-in-franco-probe.php">unanimously confirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court order that Garzon abused his power and must face trial. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The laws, passed last month in conjunction with Hungary's new constitution, are viewed by Barroso and the Commission as violations of EU law. First, the Commission contends that European law has instituted an independent national central bank, but Hungary's new law allows its Minister to participate in Monetary Council meetings, thus offering a possibility of political influence. Second, the Commission argues that EU law provides an independent judiciary and prohibits workplace discrimination based on age, but Hungary will proscribe a mandatory retirement age for judges, prosecutors and public notaries at 62 years. Third, the Commission asserts that EU law recognizes the independence of data protection supervisors, but Hungary will allow for premature termination of the Data Protection Commissioner currently in office. The Commission also contends that this law creates the possibility that the Hungarian prime minister and president could dismiss the new supervisor on arbitrary grounds. To deal with these possible infringements, Barroso and the Commission have sent three formal letters of notice to Hungary as a commencement of infringement procedures. Barroso said in a <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/12/17&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">press release</a> [text]:<blockquote>The decisions we have taken today are a reflection of our determination to make sure that EU law, both in letter and in spirit, are fully respected and a stable legal environment exists in all of our Member States. Hungary is a key member of the European family. We do not want the shadow of doubt on respect for democratic principles and values to remain over the country any longer. The quicker that this is resolved the better.</blockquote>Hungarian <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/prime-minister-s-office/the-prime-minister">Prime Minister Viktor Orban</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/prime-minister-s-office/news/waiting-for-eu-s-arguments-on-disputed-laws">said</a> [press release] that Hungary's "general approach is that we are open and flexible, we are ready to negotiate all the points but what we need is not political opinion but arguments." He has agreed to meet with Barroso next week to discuss the disputed laws.

<p>Hungary has received much recent attention regarding its introduction of controversial laws. Earlier in the month, tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside of the Hungarian State Opera to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/tens-of-thousands-protest-hungary-constitution.php">protest the new constitution</a> [JURIST report], which took effect January 1. Protesters criticized the constitution as giving the government too much power over the media, economy, and religion, which they believe to be clear violations of international human rights law. The Hungarian government, however, defended itself by asserting that the constitution, passed in April, was long overdue and embodies both national and European values. In December, Hungary's <a href="http://www.mkab.hu/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Hungarian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/hungary-court-strikes-down-provisions-of-media-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] certain provisions of a recently passed media law as an unconstitutional restraint on freedom of the press in addition to a law <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hungary-urged-to-revoke-church-law.php">regulating religious organizations</a> [JURIST report]. Hungarian President Pat Schmitt <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-president-signs-new-constitution-into-law-amid-rights-concerns.php">signed the new constitution into law</a> [JURIST report] amid societal concerns that the document contravenes European human rights principles. These concerns were echoed by <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website], who <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/04/19/hungary-new-constitution-enshrines-discrimination">said</a> [press release] that Hungary's new constitution "enshrines discrimination."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-139.pdf">United States v. Home Concrete &#38; Supply LLC</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-adds-7-cases-to-2011-docket.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on what can activate an "extended six-year assessment" period for taxes. The case questions if an understatement of gross income attributable to an overstatement of property assets can trigger this period. A Department of Treasury regulation holds that it does, and the court will also examine if this regulation should have judicial deference. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/09-26-Concrete-opinion-below.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the assessment should not have been initiated, and that the Department of Treasury's regulation was not holding. Counsel for the US argued that that Treasury Department's "regulations reflect a reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language and they are accordingly entitled to deference under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0467_0837_ZS.html">Chevron</a> [opinion]." Counsel for Home Concrete &#38; Supply argued that, "an overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross income."

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1018.pdf">Filarsky v. Delia</a> [transcript, PDF] the court heard arguments on whether a lawyer retained to work with government employees in conducting an internal affairs investigation is precluded from asserting <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity">qualified immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] solely because of his status as a "private" lawyer rather than a government employee. Firefighter Nicholas Delia brought suit against the city of Rialto, the Rialto Fire Department, several city officials and a private attorney, Steve Filarsky, for violating his constitutional rights during an internal affairs investigation. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/09-26-Filarsky-opinion-below.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Delia's rights were violated but that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity because the right was not clearly established. The Ninth Circuit also found that the private attorney was not entitled to qualified immunity. Counsel for Filarsky argued:<blockquote>When a private attorney is temporarily retained by the government to work in coordination with or under the direct supervision of government employees in fulfilling the government's business, in getting the government's work done, that attorney is entitled to the same immunity that a government employee performing that same function for that same government would receive. In this case that is qualified immunity. That rule comports with the history and policy concerns that have animated this Court's section 1983 and immunity jurisprudence.</blockquote>Counsel for the US government argued in support of Filarsky as <em>amicus curiae</em>. Counsel for Delia responded: "The Petitioner has not demonstrated a historical basis of immunity at common law for somebody in Mr. Filarsky's situation. The Petitioner has also not shown that the immunity's purposes also serve Mr. Filarsky's situation here."</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the ruling Judge Jed Rakoff found that the only purpose an appeal would serve would be to delay the trial. Picard's suit alleged that Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, owners of the baseball franchise, invested heavily in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=madoff">Bernard Madoff</a> [JURIST news archive] Ponzi scheme and failed to notice warning signs that told of Madoff's fraud. In Rakoff's 14-page opinion he found that allowing an interlocutory appeal before the rest of the litigation has played out would be counterproductive to the purpose of the trial. Additionally, he stated that only extraordinary circumstances would allow for deviation from the standard of waiting until the end of the trial for appeal and this case does not justify such action:<blockquote> After careful consideration, the Court concludes that the Trustee has entirely failed to demonstrate the kind of extraordinary circumstances that would warrant this Court in granting his motion. Indeed, with the trial of this case firmly set to begin just two months from now, the main effect of granting the Trustee's motion would be to materially delay, rather than materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.</blockquote>Rakoff's earlier ruling threw out all or part of nine of 11 of Picard's claims letting him pursue just over $300 million. The case is set to go to trial March 19, during the middle of the Mets spring training schedule. 

<p>In July the court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/bankruptcy-approves-first-payouts-to-madoff-victims.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the first payouts to Madoff's victims. Picard filed almost <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/madoff-trustee-files-nearly-60-lawsuits-to-recover-money-for-victims.php">60 lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] for victims of Madoff's fraud in December 2010, including suits against JPMorgan Chase and HSBC. Judge Louis Stanton <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/madoff/trusteeorder.pdf">made Picard the trustee</a> [order, PDF] of Bernard L. Madoff Securities, LLC in December 2008. Madoff was <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/madoff-sentenced-to-150-years-for-fraud.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] in June 2009 to 150 years in prison for securities fraud stemming from his Ponzi scheme. He <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madoff-pleads-guilty-to-securities.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 11 counts of securities fraud in March 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Arrow Financial Services LLC</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www2.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf">Telephone Consumer Protection Act</a> [FCC summary, PDF] does not deprive the federal district courts of their <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1331.html">federal question jurisdiction</a> [28 USC &#167; 1331 text] over private actions brought under the act. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/unpub/ops/201012077.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the TCPA's permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts means that federal courts lack jurisdiction over private actions under the act. Reversing the decision below, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote:<blockquote>The question presented is whether Congress' provision for private actions to enforce the TCPA renders state courts the <em>exclusive</em> arbiters of such actions. We have long recognized that "[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action." ... Beyond doubt, the TCPA is a federal law that both creates the claim Mims has brought and supplies the substantive rules that will govern the case. We find no convincing reason to read into the TCPA's permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts any barrier to the U. S. district courts' exercise of the general federal-question jurisdiction they have possessed since 1875. ... We hold, therefore, that federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the TCPA.</blockquote>The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.

<p>Congress passed the TCPA in 1991 in response to consumer complaints over abuses of telephone technology, including computerized calls to private homes. The act prohibits certain conduct and authorizes states to bring civil actions to enjoin prohibited practices and recover damages on citizens' behalf. The act also allows citizens to bring private causes of action. Petitioner Marcus Mims brought an action against Arrow Financial Services, a debt collection agency, seeking damages for numerous violations of the act. The district court dismissed his claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Gambella relocations, which occurred last year, are part of a planned resettlement of 1.5 million people throughout four regions in the country. This process, known as villagization, has been <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-01-17/news/30636092_1_new-villages-resettlement-rights-group">called a success</a> [AP report] by the Ethiopian government. HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/104348">alleges</a> [press release] that the forced relocation program has left those relocated without adequate access to basic necessities including "food, agricultural support, and health and education facilities." The advocacy group also reports alleged assaults by the state security forces charged with shepherding people to the Gambella region. HRW says they have uncovered ulterior motives for the relocations, which the Ethiopian government has said are necessary to afford villagers greater access to necessary services.<blockquote>The villagization program is taking place in areas where significant land investment is planned and/or occurring. The Ethiopian federal government has consistently denied that the villagization process in Gambella is connected to the leasing of large areas of land for commercial agriculture, but villagers have been told by local government officials that this is an underlying reason for their displacement.</blockquote>HRW is asking that the government halt plans to continue relocations until villagers receive access to necessary services.

<p>This is not the first time HRW has criticized the actions of the Ethiopian government. Late last year, HRW released a statement <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ethiopia-anti-terrorism-law-being-used-to-suppress-journalists-hrw.php">criticizing an Ethiopian anti-terrorism law</a> [JURIST report] as "fundamentally flawed and being used to repress legitimate reporting." HRW made the statement after two Swedish journalists were <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-22/ethiopia-convicts-two-swedish-reporters-of-aiding-terrorism.html">convicted</a> [Bloomberg report] of supporting terrorism under <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/procedural-law/criminal-procedure-law/special-procedures/318-anti-terrorism-proclamation-no-6522009.html">Ethiopia's Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009</a> [text]. Ethiopia's anti-terrorism law has faced ongoing criticism since it was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ethiopia-lawmakers-pass-controversial.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. In August, JURIST guest columnist and former executive director Abigail Salisbury argued that the government is using the law to suppress journalists and opposition groups in order to </forum/2011/08/abigail-salisbury-ethiopia-terror.php">maintain its hold on power</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In July, HRW called on the Ethiopian government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ethiopia-counterterrorism-law-represses-free-speech-hrw.php">stop using the law to repress free speech</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new policy allows members of a privileged review team to <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=66820">conduct a "plain-view review" of written communications</a> [DOD press release] not marked as protected attorney-client information, such review being designed to ensure the correspondence does not include physical or information contraband such as maps of the detention facility. Navy Rear Adm. David Woods, commander of the Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), defended the policy, testifying that it balances his responsibilities to facilitate attorney-client communication while also ensuring security, safety, guard protection and good order at the facility. Specifically Woods testified that the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/17/us/guantanamo-hearing/index.html">reviewers do not actually read correspondence</a> [CNN report], but simply look at mail to make sure each page is properly marked as privileged. This procedure then allows guards who monitor the inmates' cells to search the plastic bins reserved for legal paperwork and correspondence allowed in detainee living spaces, letting the guards ignore privileged papers and focus on contraband, which has been found in the "legal bins" in the past. Woods acknowledged that the policy depends on the professionalism of the review team, which is composed of former intelligence analysts, attorneys or law enforcement agents, but pointed out that each member is a civilian contractor who must sign a non-disclosure agreement that bars them from sharing any information, and that their contract does not fall under Woods' purview. The prosecution for the hearing called the issue and testimony irrelevant to the case because al Nashiri has not been subject to mail searches during his detainment at Guantanamo.

<p>Lawyers for detainees at Guantanamo have previously raised concerns with practices used at the prison. Last November, lawyers complained specifically about the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/jurist-lawyers-charged-with-defending.php">infringement on attorney-client privilege</a> [JURIST report] in a letter directed to the attention of the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs. The attorneys alleged that those working with the JTF-GTMO seize, open, interpret, read and review attorney-client privileged communications, actions which the attorneys argued are unlawful. Also in November <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/about-us/staff-board/dixon,-j.-wells">J. Wells Dixon</a>, Senior Staff Attorney for the Guantanamo Global Justice Initiative at the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, wrote that there is a systematic dysfunction within the bureaucracy of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility that impacts the capability of attorneys to adequately represent their clients: "Having traveled to Guantanamo numerous times over many years to meet with men detained there, it comes as no surprise to me that someone, somewhere in the bureaucracy of Guantanamo, ordered a disruptive and ultimately needless examination of legal papers and correspondence kept by detainees, including materials clearly marked as privileged." This month marks the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/guantanamo-bay-detention-facility-marks-its-tenth-anniversary-of-operation.php">tenth anniversary of detention operations at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his statement, Judge Peter Gibson said that the Secretary of State for Justice chose to conclude the investigation "in view of further Metropolitan Police investigations." The Inquiry faced criticism from a variety of human rights groups for its lack of transparency. Last August, 10 human rights groups said they would <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/rights-group-boycotting-uk-detainee-torture-inquiry.php">boycott the investigation</a> [JURIST report], arguing that it did not comply with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. Gibson stressed that although their investigation was not completed, they have conducted research which will be useful for future investigations:<blockquote>We recognise that it is not practical for the Inquiry to continue for an indefinite period to wait for the conclusion of the police investigations. The Inquiry has, however, already done a large amount of preliminary work, including the collation of many documents from Government departments and the Security and Intelligence Agencies. We welcome therefore the opportunity to bring together the work we have done to date. The Inquiry will therefore produce a report of our work, highlighting themes which might be subject to further examination.</blockquote>Gibson said that it was important to ensure that the Inquiry's work did not go to waste. The <a href="http://content.met.police.uk/Home">Metropolitan Police Service</a> (MPS) [official website] will continue to investigate allegations of torture.

<p>Last week, the MPS announced that there was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/uk-intelligence-agents-will-not-face-trial-for-alleged-torture-involvement.php">not enough evidence to try British intelligence agents</a> [JURIST report] for alleged complicity in the torture of two detainees. They indicated that they could reopen the cases if new information surfaced through the Detainee Inquiry. In the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_statements/joint_statement_by_the_director_of_public_prosecutions_and_the_metropolitan_police_service/">joint statement</a> [text] of the MPS and the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/about/dpp.html">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> [official website], they also announced the commencement of two new investigations of torture allegations in Libya. Last March former Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7567592.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Pervez+Musharraf">news archive</a>] said in a BBC documentary that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/pakistan-ex-president-musharraf-says-uk-gave-tacit-approval-to-use-of-torture.php">UK gave "tacit approval" for torture</a> [JURIST report] of terror suspects. In July 2010 <a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">UK Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] announced the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-panel-to-investigate-torture-allegations.php">creation of the Detainee Inquiry</a> [JURIST report], after <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/rights-group-urges-uk-to-set-up-judicial-inquiry-on-torture.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UK government to investigate torture allegations and reaffirm its support for human rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that Congress has the authority under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/">Copyright Act</a> [text] to restore copyright protection in foreign works where the work was never registered in the US and the full copyright term has expired. Plaintiffs challenged &#167; 514 of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/doc/uruguay/uraaact.html">Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994</a> (URAA) [text], which restored copyright protection to thousands of foreign works that had previously been in the public domain. Plaintiffs argued that (1) the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8">Progress Clause</a> [Art I, &#167; 8, cl 8 text] of the US Constitution prohibits Congress from taking works out of the public domain; and (2) that &#167; 514 violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] because taking works out of the public domain inhibits free speech. However, the Supreme Court stated that Congress was right to seek harmonization with international law:<blockquote>Congress determined that U.S. interests were best served by our full participation in the dominant system of international copyright protection. Those interests include ensuring exemplary compliance with our international obligations, securing  greater protection for U. S. authors abroad, and remedying unequal treatment of foreign authors. The judgment &#167; 514 expresses lies well within the ken of the political branches.</blockquote>The Supreme Court held that &#167; 514 of the URAA does not exceed Congress' authority because the Copyright Clause does not specifically exclude extending copyright protection to works that are already in the public domain. The plaintiffs argued that &#167; 514 violated the Progress Clause because protecting works that were already in the public domain does not "promote the progress of science and useful arts" because the intent of copyright protection was to incentivize the creation of new works, not to protect works which have already been created. However, the court held that "[t]he creation of new works ... is not the sole way Congress may promote ... knowledge and learning." Finally, the court held that &#167;514 does not violate the First Amendment because copyright protection has "built-in First Amendment accommodations," such as the idea/expression dichotomy and the fair use defense, and that there is nothing in the historical record, congressional practice or the Supreme Court's jurisprudence which renders works in the public domain untouchable by Congress. The ruling affirms the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit's <a href="http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/09/09-1234.pdf">judgment</a> that &#167; 514 of the URAA did not violate the Constitution, overturning the district court's grant of summary judgment for the petitioners.

<p>In December 2010, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/supreme-court-splits-on-copyright-protections-for-imported-goods.php">split 4-4</a> [JURIST report] on the issue of copyright protection for imported goods. The case presented the question of whether the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/usc_sec_17_00000109----000-.html">first-sale doctrine</a> [17 USC &#167; 109(a)], which provides that the owner of any particular copy "lawfully made under this title" may resell that good without the authority of the copyright holder, applies to imported goods manufactured abroad. Because of the split, with Justice Elena Kagan recused, the ruling of the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to imported goods was affirmed, although the decision does not establish controlling precedent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <span class="casename">Joyner v. Forsyth County</span>, decided last July, the  <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ruling-that-county-board-meeting-prayers-violated-first-amendment.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the Forsyth County <a href="http://www.co.forsyth.nc.us/Commissioners/Default.aspx">Board of Commissioners</a> [official website] violated the Establishment Clause by effectively using a public forum to endorse Christianity. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which originally filed the lawsuit on behalf of two Forsyth county residents, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/us-supreme-court-declines-hear-forsyth-county-sectarian-prayer-case">applauded</a> [press release] the Supreme Court's refusal to review the case, saying that the law was now settled on prayer in government meetings. Katy Parker, director of the <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/">ACLU of North Carolina Legal Foundation</a> (ACLU-NCLF) [advocacy website] declared:<blockquote>Overtly sectarian prayer does not belong in a government meeting. This is the same conclusion that was reached by three separate lower courts who heard our case. The law is now settled, and we are very happy that nobody in Forsyth County will feel like a second-class citizen because of what they believe.</blockquote>The Supreme Court's decision not to review <span class="casename">Joyner</span> effectively makes the Fourth Circuit's decision final and ends a legal battle that began five years ago when the ACLU filed suit against the Board of Commissioners in 2007.

<p>Public prayer has generated a substantial amount of controversy recently. In August, JURIST contributor John Whitehead <a href="/hotline/2011/08/john-whitehead-legislative-prayer.php">noted</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the Fourth Circuit's decision in <span class="casename">Joyner</span> contradicted precedent establishing that public officials beginning meetings with a prayer is constitutionally permissible. In April the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-to-national-day-of-prayer.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a constitutional challenge to the <a href="http://nationaldayofprayer.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> (NDP) [official website]. The Seventh Circuit's decision overturned a <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-rules-national-day-of.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] that the NDP was an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thomas</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that death row inmate Cory Maples sufficiently established cause excusing the procedural default rule when his attorney left his law firm causing Maples to miss a filing deadline. Maples' attorney argued that he effectively had no local counsel, thus the lack of proper notification to his true counsel, who had never withdrawn, was a clear error. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit had <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-error-in-a-death-penalty-case-right-to-counsel.php">held</a> [JURIST report] the state of Alabama may execute Maples without federal <em>habeas</em> review of his constitutional claims. In a 7-2 decision written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed. The court held that Maples was trapped when his counsel abandoned him without warning:<blockquote>In the unusual circumstances of this case, principles of agency law and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: There was indeed cause to excuse Maples' procedural default. Through no fault of his own, Maples lacked the assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42 days Alabama allows for noticing an appeal from a trial court's denial of post conviction relief. As just observed, he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se status. Maples was disarmed by extraordinary circumstances quite beyond his control.</blockquote>Since the district court and the Eleventh Circuit never reached the question of prejudice, the Supreme Court left the issue open for the lower courts to decide on remand.

<p>An Alabama trial court had dismissed Maples' petition for post-conviction relief and sent notice of this ruling to his out-of-state attorneys, but the notice was returned to the court unopened because the attorneys had changed firms. The court's clerk did not attempt to notify his attorneys again. The clerk did, however, notify Maples' in-state attorney who neither acted nor notified the attorneys who were more directly involved in his case. Maples was convicted of capital murder for killing two people after a night of drinking. He had argued his counsel was ineffective because it failed to present evidence of his intoxication and his drug history, which he believed would have mitigated his sentence. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-to-examine-whether-death-penalty-appeal-can-continue-despite-missed-deadline.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in October. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1542.pdf">Holder v. Sawyers</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-adds-7-cases-to-2011-docket.php">report</a>], consolidated with <span class = "casename">Holder v. Gutierrez</span>, the court heard arguments on whether alien children of legal residents can have their parents' years in the country imputed to them for the purposes of obtaining citizenship. The court also considered whether the children were citizens while they had residence with the legal parent. The Solicitor General argued that <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_08_00001229---b000-.html">8 USC &#167; 1229b(a)</a> [text] has always been clear that about requirements for resident and it implies that parents' residency does not automatically impute on to a child, which has been upheld through the discretion of the Board of Immigration Appeals consistently. The respondents' attorney argued that since the statute was silent as to imputation, it was inherently ambiguous: "the ambiguity arises because the requirements for which there is imputation, status and residency, are matters that are not within the capacity or the control of a minor. A minor does not decide whether or when a parent will apply for [lawful permanent resident] status for him or her."

<p>The court also considered <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1211.pdf">Vartelas v. Holder</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-adds-7-cases-to-2011-docket.php">report</a>], to decide whether <a href = "http://supreme.justia.com/us/374/449/case.html">Rosenberg v. Fleuti</a> [opinion text] should be applied to plaintiff Panagis Vartelas instead of current immigration law that repeals the law settled in <span class = "casename">Fleuti</span>. <span class = "casename">Rosenberg v. Fleuti</span> held that a permanent legal resident can make "innocent, casual, and brief" trips abroad without being denied reentry. But this interpreted law was changed by <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode08/usc_sec_08_00001101----000-.html">8 USC &#167; 1101(a)(13)(C)(v)</a> [text], which holds that a permanent resident can be denied reentry if he has committed a crime of "moral turpitude" in the past. Vartelas pleaded guilty to a crime before the law was ratified and then left the US briefly and was denied reentry. Vartelas' attorney argued that the statute does not mandate retroactive application explicitly, as well as the relative fairness of the statute: "Covered lawful permanent residents could not visit their parents abroad without being forced to abandon their children here. They would be removed from the country or else confined here. Either way, they would lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law based on pre-IIRIRA offenses. Thus applying the subsection to them would be impermissibly retroactive." The attorney for the Solicitor General argued that the law applied regardless, because Vartelas took the trip after the law was promulgated, and thus had constructive notice. Chief Justice John Roberts argued with the Solicitor General's lawyer about the peculiarity of the law itself: "Counsel, I have to&#8212;I just don't understand this statute. This is somebody we would not allow into the country. And yet the only thing we say is: You can't leave. I just don't understand how that&#8212;how that works. [...] [A]nd I understand that there is a limitation on actually deporting the person. But here I think the one thing you want the person to do is leave. Maybe for a particular event, but maybe he will decide to stay in Greece if once he's there for the&#8212;but it seems very odd to say: We are going to show you how much we don't want you here; we are not going to let you leave."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.senat.fr/dossier-legislatif/ppl11-229.html">proposed law</a> [materials], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/france-lower-house-approves-genocide-denial-ban.php">approved by the French National Assembly</a> [JURIST report] in December, sparked animosity in Turkey, which does not consider the 1915 killings genocide. If passed, the law would impose criminal penalties on those who are deemed to be "condoning, denying or grossly trivializing crimes of genocide." In a press release, the committee expressed concern about the constitutionality of the law:<blockquote>[This committee] has long questioned the legitimacy of legislative intervention in the field of history&#8212;whereas the adoption of resolutions and organizing commemorations were probably more appropriate ways to express the solidarity of the Nation with the suffering of the victims. It considered that the creation of a criminal offense ... recognized by law incur[s] a high risk of being at odds with several principles recognized in our Constitution&#8212;in particular the principle of legality of crimes and sentences, the principle of freedom of opinion and expression and the principle of freedom of research.</blockquote>The committee resolved to oppose the bill and will move to dismiss the legislation from the Senate on Monday. 

<p>The Armenian genocide is also a contentious issue in US law and politics. In November the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ninth-circuit-to-rehear-armenia-genocide-lawsuit.php">revisit a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether a California law declaring Armenian genocide in Turkey conflicts with US foreign policy. In August 2010 a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-over-armenian-genocide-curriculum.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the exclusion of materials questioning the Armenian genocide from a school curriculum. In March 2010 the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">announced its opposition to a resolution</a> [JURIST report] labeling the World War I-era killings as genocide. The announcement came after the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 23-22. Erdogan condemned the resolution, and the Turkish government recalled its ambassador to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Section 12 mandates the establishment of the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) dedicated to the "promotion of the rule of law; promotion and protection of human rights, particularly for those belonging to vulnerable groups; and support for transitional justice."

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread during the conflict in Libya.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaustralia.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] A panel of Australian citizens on Thursday proposed that the country's <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/index.htm">Constitution</a> [materials] <a href="http://www.youmeunity.org.au/final-report">recognize the Australian indigenous population</a> [report materials], including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Currently, although Aborigines make up almost three percent of the Australian population, they are not mentioned in the constitution. The panel, consisting of Australian business executives, political leaders, Aboriginal leaders and legal scholars, produced the report recommending that the Australian government <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/19/world/asia/australia-constitution-panel/">make changes</a> [CNN report] to the constitution in an effort to decrease racial discrimination and foster "a sense of national unity." The panel suggested that recognizing the indigenous population in the constitution conforms with the nation's evolution:<blockquote>The consultations the Panel undertook were a reminder of how far Australia has come since the nation's legal and political foundations were laid down in the late nineteenth century. Then, in line with the values of the times, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were excluded from the deliberations that led to the adoption of the Constitution. The text of the Constitution excluded them. It was not until two-thirds of the way through the nation's first century that the exclusion was removed and the Constitution shifted closer to a position of neutrality. The logical next step is to achieve full inclusion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution by recognising their continuing cultures, languages and heritage as an important part of our nation and by removing the outdated notion of race.</blockquote>The Australian government expressed its appreciation for the panel's work and said it would <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/press-office/towards-constitutional-recognition-indigenous-australians">carefully review the recommendations</a> [press release]. 

<p>In recent years, the Australian government has recognized the long history of discrimination and disadvantage among its native citizens, although its efforts have not always resulted in better conditions. Australian <a href="http://www.pm.gov.au/">Prime Minister Julia Gillard</a> [official website] <a thref="/paperchase/2010/11/australia-announces-referendum-to-recognize-indigenous-people-in-constitution.php">announced a national referendum</a> [JURIST report] that sought to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the Australian Constitution in November 2010. In August 2010, Amnesty International Australia (AIA) <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/australia-racial-discrimination-violates-international-obligations.php">criticized the racial discrimination</a> [JURIST report] that exists in Australia, which, according to AIA, violates the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm">International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [texts]. In June 2010, the Australian government <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/australia-reinstates-racial-discrimination-laws.php">reinstated its previously suspended Racial Discrimination Act</a> [JURIST report] in the Northern Territory, which allows governmental authorities to regulate how welfare money is spent by the indigenous people of the country. In March 2010, UN special rapporteur James Anaya <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=9891&amp;LangID=E">condemned the law</a> [press release], calling it problematic from a human rights point of view. Australia <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/australia-endorses-un-declaration-on.php">endorsed</a> [JURIST report] the aforementioned Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, which reversed the position held by previous Australian governments. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd championed the cause of improved living conditions for and relations with Australia's indigenous population during his term in office, and offered and official apology on behalf of the federal government in February 2008 for past mistreatment to the nation's indigenous population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Dissident Li Tie was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16597830">sentenced for subversion</a> [BBC report]. The charges were brought in response to pro-democracy articles Li wrote in 2010. Li professed his innocence saying that his articles accorded with the Constitution. Li was detained in September 2010, but his trial did not take place until April 2011. During the trial Li's family attempted to hire a lawyer, but the government removed him from the case and appointed a government lawyer. His family has vowed to appeal the conviction. <a href="http://chrdnet.com/">Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> [advocacy website] rejected the decision and said that such harsh sentences would <a href="http://chrdnet.com/2012/01/18/chinese-democracy-activist-li-tie-jailed-for-ten-years-for-&#8220;subversion&#8221;/">do nothing to prevent</a> [news release] or curb the social unrest.  

<p>This is the third time in a month that a dissident has been sentenced for subversion. Chen Xi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-court-setences-dissident-to-10-years-in-prison.php">sentenced to 10 years</a> [JURIST report] in late December for publishing political essays online. In that same month a court sentenced Chen Wei to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-court-sentences-dissident-to-nine-years-in-prison.php">nine years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. The sentence came as a response to charges that stemmed from written essays critical of the Communist Party, which Chen published on overseas Chinese websites, avoiding the national Internet censorship firewalls. Earlier this week dissident Zhu Yufu was charged with subversion for writing and publishing a poem on the internet that urged people to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16597830">act in support of freedom</a> [BBC report]. Two longer sentences for subversion convictions belong to Nobel Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">JURIST news archive</a>], who has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">serving an 11-year sentence </a>[JURIST report] since 2009, and Liu Xianbin, who was jailed for 10 years in March 2011.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gilani was ordered to appear to explain why he did not comply with court's order to reopen a corruption case against <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website]. Gilani maintained that Zardari is <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iu1qdqzieRxbjGzVHDzV60UbwWrw?docId=37be0b8efd2049b8b344f0de9a5de524">immune from prosecution</a> [AP report]. The conflict between the prime minister and the court stems from an order which <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2009, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999. The court wants the government to ask Swiss authorities to reopen their case against Zardari, who was found guilty <em>in absentia</em> in Swiss court in 2003, but the case was subsequently dropped at the request of the Pakistani government. The court adjourned the matter for two weeks, scheduling a hearing on February 1 to hear more arguments on the case, including the issue of the president's immunity. 

<p>These proceedings reflect an ongoing struggle between the government and the courts in Pakistan. Last month, the Supreme Court formed a judicial committee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/pakistan-supreme-court-to-investigate-memo-scandal.php">investigate a secret memo</a> [JURIST report] sent from an unknown Pakistani source to US Admiral Mike Mullen in May asking for help in preventing a suspected army coup. Zardari and former Pakistan ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani have been accused of writing or having knowledge of the memo, and both have denied these allegations. In October 2011, the Supreme Court issued a judgment <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/pakistan-top-judge-orders-political-parties-to-cut-ties-with-%20criminal-gangs.php">urging political parties to stop financing criminal groups</a> [JURIST report] responsible for increased violence in the city of Karachi. The decision stated that militant groups have gained strength because of support from local political groups and order the Pakistani government to help address the corruption. The Court struck down the NRO in 2009, which was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by former Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4797762.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile; JURIST<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf"> news archive</a>] in 2007. </p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/19/ethiopia-terrorism-verdict-quashes-free-speech">reported</a> [press release] Thursday that the defendants had no access to legal counsel during their three months in pretrial detention and that the court did not investigate allegations of torture and mistreatment while in detention. Although two of the convicted journalists argued that they had been beaten and tortured in prison, the court chose not to investigate the matter furthe . Said <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/leslie-lefkow">Lesli Lefkow</a> [HRW profile], senior Africa researcher at HRW:
<blockquote>The verdict against these five people confirms that Ethiopia's anti-terrorism law is being used to crush independent reporting and peaceful political dissent. The Ethiopian courts are complicit in this political witch-hunt. Getting a fair trial in a political case in Ethiopia today may be impossible. The prosecution should drop the charges against these defendants and instead investigate their allegations of torture.</blockquote>Claire Beston, the Ethiopia researcher at <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], echoed Lefkow's statement when she <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/ethiopia-terror-convictions-affront-free-speech-2012-01-19">asserted</a> [press release] that much of the evidence against the defendants was merely journalistic reports and calls for peaceful protests against the government. Under the anti-terrorism law, conspiracy to commit terrorist acts carries a sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment or death. Sentencing is expected to occur on January 26.

<p>Ethiopia's anti-terrorism law has faced consistent criticism since being <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ethiopia-lawmakers-pass-controversial.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] in 2009. Most recently, in December, two Swedish journalists were convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison for supporting terrorism and entering Ethiopia illegally. There, the court did not find credible the journalists' argument that they entered into the country with a terrorist group in order to gain access to an area restricted to journalists. In response, HRW argued that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ethiopia-anti-terrorism-law-being-used-to-suppress-journalists-hrw.php">law is being used to suppress journalists</a> [JURIST report], that the trial was unfair and that the Swedes should be <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/12/21/ethiopia-journalists-convicted-under-unfair-law">released immediately</a> [press release]. Similarly, in August, JURIST guest columnist and former executive director Abigail Salisbury argued that the Ethiopian government is using the law to suppress journalists and opposition groups in order to <a href="/forum/2011/08/abigail-salisbury-ethiopia-terror.php">maintain its hold on power</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In July, HRW called on the government to stop using the <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/ethiopia-counterterrorism-law-represses-free-speech-hrw.php">law to repress free speech</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The individuals, who worked for five different investment institutions, are accused of earning illegal profits on the basis of insider information regarding publicly traded companies, including Dell Inc. and NVIDIA. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/">Preet Bharara</a> [official profile] described the nature of the illegal conduct and expressed his  <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January12/newmantoddetalchargespr.pdf">intent to curb insider trading</a> [press release, PDF]:<blockquote>The charges unsealed today allege a corrupt circle of friends who formed a criminal club whose purpose was profit and whose members regularly bartered lucrative inside information so their respective funds could illegally profit. And profit they allegedly did&#8212;to the tune of more than $61 million on illegal trades of a single stock&#8212;much of it coming in a $53 million short trade. Here, The Big Short was The Big Illegal Short. We have demonstrated through our prosecutions that insider trading is rampant and has its own social network, a network we intend to dismantle. We will be unrelenting in our pursuit of those who think they are above the law. </blockquote> <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/our-leadership/fedarcyk">Janice Fedarcyk</a> [official profile], Assistant Director-in-Charge of the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/">New York Office of the FBI</a> [official website] also <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2012/prepared-remarks-of-assistant-director-in-charge-janice-k.-fedarcyk-on-insider-trading-arrests">condemned the alleged insider trading conspiracy</a> [press release]. Three of the seven have already pleaded guilty to counts of securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud and are cooperating with the government. The men face potential penalties of five to 25 in prison and fines of $250,000 to $5 million.

<p>US prosecutors and the FBI have targeted insider trading in the investment industry in recent years. Raj Rajaratnam, co-founder of the Galleon Group, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-hedge-fund-founder-convicted-of-insider-trading.php">convicted of 14 counts of insider trading</a> [JURIST report] in May and <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/hedge-fund-executive-rajaratnam-sentenced-to-11-years-for-insider-trading.php">sentenced to 11 years in federal prison</a> [JURIST report] in one of the largest hedge fund insider trading cases in US history. Several other defendants have pleaded guilty in connection with the case. Former hedge fund consultant Danielle Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/key-defendant-in-galleon-insider-trading-trial-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in January. Former IBM senior vice president Robert Moffat was <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/former-ibm-executive-sentenced-to-6-months-in-galleon-insider-trading-case.php">sentenced to six months in prison</a> in September 2010 and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine for his role in the scheme after <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleading guilty</a> [JURIST reports] in March 2010. Former Intel Capital executive Rajiv Goel <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/former-ibm-executive-pleads-guilty-to.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to insider trading charges in February 2010. Rajaratnam, Chiesi, Goel and Moffat were arrested in October 2009 and <a href="http://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2009/comp21255.pdf">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] along with two other individuals and two business entities with insider trading. The complaint alleged that the individuals provided Galleon Group and another hedge fund with material nonpublic information about several corporations upon which the funds traded, generating $25 million in illicit gain. Rajaratnam and Chiesi <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/us-hedge-fund-founder-pleads-not-guilty.php">originally pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009 after being indicted for insider trading.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-texas-redistricting-plan.php">emergency appeal</a> [JURIST report] challenged an interim map drawn up by the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> while a separate map drawn up by the state legislature is currently being challenged in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official websites] for compliance with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder]. In a per curiam opinion, the court rejected the interim maps, finding that, "it is unclear whether the District Court for the Western District of Texas followed the appropriate standards." Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate concurrence in which he argued that Section 5 of the VRA, which requires preclearance of the redistricting plan, is unconstitutional. Also Friday, the court <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/11A674-SCt-order-1-20-12.pdf">set aside</a> [order, PDF] a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-judges-reject-west-virginia-redistricting-plan.php">lower court ruling</a> [JURIST report] that declared West Virginia's redistricting plan unconstitutional until the court can rule on the matter.

<p>According to the 2010 census, Texas' population grew by 4.3 million, which gave it four more seats in the US House of Representatives. The Republican-controlled state legislature redrew the congressional districts in a way that challengers claim would make it more likely for Republicans to win those new seats. The plan must be approved by either the Justice Department or a federal court under Section 5 of the VRA, and the Obama administration has objected to the plan. In the meantime, the federal court in Texas drew an "interim map" for use in the 2012 election. That is the map that is currently being challenged before the Supreme Court. The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-texas-legislature-redistricting-maps.php">reject the interim maps</a>, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-texas-redistricting-case.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in the case last week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge also found that six other police officers were innocent. One of the convicted officers fled the country before the trial and was convicted <em>in absentia</em>. The officers were accused of murder, attempted murder and other crimes during a prison riot in Les Cayes. The decision was based on numerous witness testimonials. The sentences range from two to 13 years of hard labor. Twenty-one other officials fled before the trial, and the court plans to try those officials <em>in absentia</em> in the near future.

The <a href="http://www.sabanews.net/ar/news257526.htm">original draft</a> [text, in Arabic] of the law, which gave full immunity to Saleh and all civil, military and security agents who worked under him, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/yemen-cabinet-approves-immunity-for-abdullah-saleh.php">passed by the Council of Ministers</a> [JURIST report] almost two weeks ago.

<p>Voting on the original bill was <a href="http://yementimes.com/defaultdet.aspx?SUB_ID=35104">postponed for the third time</a> [<em>Yemen Times</em> report] Wednesday.

The statement comes as North Korea begins a new era of leadership under <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11388628">Kim Jong-un</a> [BBC profile], the son of and successor to the recently deceased leader <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10745725">Kim Jong-il</a> [BBC obituary]. Darusman gave the statement at the end of an official visit to Japan where he met with North Korean defectors and Japanese officials engaged with North Korea. He said that he had gathered information including "numerous reports of a dire humanitarian situation, in particular the serious shortage of food, and the critical human rights situation" in North Korea. Darusman noted the potential for improved human rights with the new leadership:<blockquote>The ramifications of this change on the people of DPRK, and on neighboring countries will only unfold in the comings days and months. However, I am hoping that the new leadership in DPRK will use the change in leadership as an opportunity to engage with the international community and secure global confidence. The world is eagerly looking at DPRK to see what lies ahead, and hoping that the authorities will take measures to improve the human rights situation of the people of DPRK.</blockquote>Darusman also discussed the alleged abduction of Japanese and other foreign nationals by North Korea, and advocated for their return.

<p>Darusman criticized North Korea's human rights record in November, focusing on the treatment of prisoners and echoing a <a href = "http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href = "http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/gashc4032.doc.htm">resolution</a> [text] concerning the country's human rights conditions. In March 2010 the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] adopted a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/un-rights-body-condemns-north-korea.php">condemning</a> [JURIST report] North Korea for human rights abuses. Earlier in March, the UN Special Rapporteur for North Korea, Vitit Muntarbhorn reported to the UNHRC that North Korean human rights situation was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/north-korea-rights-situation-continuing.php">continuing to deteriorate</a> [JURIST report]. This report came after Muntarbhorn's previous criticism, in October, 2009, of North Korea's <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/un-investigator-condemns-north-korea.php">"abysmal"</a> [JURIST report] and ongoing human rights violations, alleging that the authoritarian government was responsible for various abuses, including torture, public executions, extensive surveillance, media censorship, women's rights violations and widespread hunger.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court reasoned that the policy violated the fundamental right to receive information under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text] of the Constitution and that denying access to public libraries to some is an infringement on this right. While the court held that the current policy is in violation of the Constitution, it noted that a less strict policy may be an option for the city, stating:<blockquote>We note that our decision does not signal the death knell of the City's efforts, if it wishes to pursue them, to restrict access of registered sex offenders to the City's public libraries. ... Like the Supreme Court, we "generally will not strike down a governmental action" for failure to leave open adequate alternative channels of communication "unless the government enactment will foreclose an entire medium of public expression across the landscape of a particular community or setting.</blockquote>The appeals court affirmed the 2009 ruling of a US District Court judge in New Mexico who held that the city's ban was too restrictive. The policy banning sex offenders from Albuquerque public libraries began in 2008 when the former mayor of the city <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-sexoffenders-librariestre80k05s-20120120,0,2524816.story">ordered the city libraries</a> [Reuters report] to inform registered sex offenders by letter that they were no longer allowed to use the facilities. 

<p>US courts have seen numerous constitutional challenges to laws placing restrictions on sex offenders. In August, the American Civil Liberties filed a complaint in federal court seeking to block a Louisiana law that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-seeks-to-block-louisiana-sex-offender-internet-use-law.php">limits Internet use for registered sex offenders</a> [JURIST report]. In May 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">mentally ill sex offenders may be civilly committed</a> [JURIST report] beyond their prison sentences. The New Jersey Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/new-jersey-high-court-bars-sex-offender.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 that local ordinances prohibiting convicted sex offenders from living near schools, playgrounds, and other public areas were preempted by the state's Megan's Law and, therefore, invalid. In March 2009, the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that a South Carolina law requiring convicted first degree sex offenders to submit to a DNA test and pay $250 in processing fees prior to their release <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/fourth-circuit-rules-south-carolina-sex.php">does not violate the ex post facto clause  of the Constitution</a> [JURIST report]. A judge in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California ruled in February 2009 that the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act of 2006 (SORNA), which makes it a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/federal-judge-rules-sex-offender.php">federal crime for a sex offender to attempt to move to another state</a> [JURIST report] while failing to register in a nationwide database, is unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Chevron appealed on grounds that the lower court's decision violated Ecuador's constitution because the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/20/chevron-idUSL3E8CK3QS20120120">court failed to correct or punish</a> [Reuters report] the "extensive fraud and corruption" that was being committed by the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. Chevron, which inherited the case after taking over Texaco, argued that the application of law was also incorrect because Ecuador released Texaco from liability during the 1990s. Chevron has also attempted to find other ways to overturn the judgment by instituting arbitration proceedings in The Hague under the <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/43558.pdf">US-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty</a> (BIT) [text, PDF]. In February 2011, the tribunal conducting the arbitration proceedings ordered Ecuador to suspend enforcement of the lower court's judgment against Chevron until further notice. Chevron has also instituted a suit in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against the plaintiff's representatives for violating federal statutes, including racketeering.

<p>The judgment against Chevron was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/ecuador-court-upholds-multi-billion-dollar-fine-against-chevron.php">upheld in January</a> by a three-judge panel of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. The $18 billion fine, one of the largest in the history of environmental contamination suits, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">was originally set at $8.6 billion</a> [JURIST report] but was more than doubled for Chevron's refusal to pay "moral reparations" to the Ecuadorian government, as required by the original ruling. The <a href="http://www.texacotoxico.org/eng/">Amazon Defense Coalition</a> [advocacy website], plaintiffs in the suit, have responded that the first judgment was a reaffirmation of how Chevron's greed and criminal misconduct in dumping billions of gallons of toxic waste into the river has led to death and disease. Damages were initially awarded in February by the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios which found that Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, polluted large areas of the country's rain forest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

ECCC judges, including Blunk, have been criticized for allegedly failing to conduct impartial investigations.

The first trial will focus on the beginning two phases of population movement and allegations of crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution not on religious grounds and forced disappearances associated with the first phases of population movement.

Rios Montt was in control of Guatemala from 1982 to 1983 as a result of a coup and is being charged with crimes against humanity and genocide during his rule. He was protected from prosecution until this month because he was serving in congress. Rios Montt said he would <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/epa/article/ALeqM5i1ewq92MO8gZfg2oWCJ36pDXdUmw?docId=1699008">cooperate with the court</a> [EFE report, in Spanish]. The case involves at least 1,771 deaths and 1,400 human rights violations during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/guatemala.htm">36-year Guatemalan Civil War</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] with much of the violations occurring during Rios Montt's rule.

<p>The Guatemalan civil war resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala's large indigenous Mayan population. According to a <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/spanish/toc.html">UN report</a> [text, in Spanish] released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. In response to these violations, the Guatemalan government founded the National Compensation Program (PNR) in 2003 to deal with claims by civilians affected by the civil war. The PNR, after setting up its administrative structure, has begun to use its $40 million budget to work through a backlog of more than 98,000 civilian complaints. <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/guatemala-court-sentences-ex-soldiers-to-6000-years.php">Four former soldiers</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/former-guatemala-police-sentenced-to-40-years-with-evidence-from-rediscovered-archive.php">two former police officers</a> [JURIST reports] have already been convicted in relation to these crime.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/fronthrw.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href = "http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/world-report-2012-strengthen-support-arab-spring">released</a> [press release] its annual <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012">World Report</a> [materials] on Sunday, leading with a criticism of Western governments' support of Middle Eastern regimes that stifle and suppress protests. The comprehensive report catalogs all of the world's major human rights violations and gives HRW's outlook on trends and remedies to ongoing situations. Focusing on the reverberations of recent uprisings in the Middle East, HRW recommended that democratic governments reject autocracies:<blockquote>Western policy towards Arab countries traditionally has been one of containment, backing an array of Arab autocrats to guarantee "stability" in the region even as democracy spread in other parts of the world. Human Rights Watch said the reasons so many democratic governments make an "Arab exception" include fear of political Islam and terrorism, the need to keep oil supplies flowing, and a longstanding policy of reliance on autocracies to maintain Arab Israeli peace and to help stifle migration to Europe.</blockquote>HRW also cited the Middle Eastern revolutions and protests as inspiration for citizens in other oppressed nations, including <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=China">China</a>, <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=North+Korea">North Korea</a>, <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> [JURIST news archives]. However, HRW strongly criticized the continued lack of international action on <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Yemen">Yemen</a>, <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Bahrain">Bahrain</a> and <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Syria">Syria</a> [JURIST news archives], and pleaded with Western nations to "clearly sid[e] with democratic reformers even at the expense of abandoning autocratic friends. There is no excuse for any government to tolerate Assad's lethal repression, to close its eyes to Bahrain's systematic crackdown, or to exempt other monarchs from pressure to reform."

<p>Although much of the report focused on last year's Middle Eastern uprisings, there were several other criticisms leveled at various nations. HRW reprimanded the <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-united-states">US</a>, the <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-european-union#uk">UK</a> [HRW reports] and other Western nations for disavowing torture programs while castigating Middle Eastern nations for similar actions. In addition to criticizing the US illegal detention programs, the report also pointed to extreme prisoner rights abuses and a high level of incarceration of illegal immigrants and racial minorities. European nations were reprimanded for a number of human rights abuses, including <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-european-union#france">France</a> [HRW report] <a href = "/hotline/2010/09/france-deportation-of-roma-migrants-reflects-long-standing-policy.php">expelling Roma immigrants</a> [JURIST comment], Hungary's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/hungary-court-strikes-down-provisions-of-media-law.php">controversial media law</a> [JURIST report] and Italy's rejection of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/04/italy-deports-former-guantanamo-detainee-to-home-country-of-tunisia.php">Tunisian refugees</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-belarus">Belarus</a> [HRW report] was highlighted for its <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Belarus">many human rights violations</a> [JURIST news archive], including voter fraud, taking of political prisoners, stifling of the Internet and dissent and its continued use of the death penalty. The report praised <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/bosnia-and-herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-croatia">Croatia</a> and <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/serbia">Serbia</a> [HRW reports] for holding war criminals accountable by supporting the <a href = "http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website], especially in the arrest of <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Ratko+Mladic">Ratko Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive]. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> and <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-russia">Russia</a> [HRW reports] received the sharpest rebukes for European human rights violations, with HRW especially noting that Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's future run for president in Russia is "a foregone conclusion, and cast[s] a shadow over the prospect of much-needed political reform." HRW also commented that the trial of <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Yulia+Tymoshenko">Yulia Tymoshenko</a> [JURIST news archive] has shaken the faith in the judiciary of <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-ukraine-0">Ukraine</a>, while in <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-turkey">Turkey</a> [HRW reports] the biggest issue was their negligence in addressing the needs of the Kurdish people.</p>

<p>Africa's human rights record continues to disturb HRW, with much of the focus on the <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/c-te-d-ivoire">Ivory Coast</a> [HRW report] and its violent <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">presidential election</a> [JURIST news archive] last year that resulted in the death of approximately 3,000 people. The report praised the nation for attempting to return to the rule of law by holding legislative elections in December and allowing <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">International Criminal Court intervention</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-democratic-republic-congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) [HRW report] received criticism for continued violence, especially in the wake of a recent <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/icc-prosecutor-drc-election-violence-will-not-be-tolerated.php">presidential election</a> [JURIST report], but was commended for its attempts to prosecute perpetrators of rape as a military tactic, although HRW would like to see more progress in apprehending the actors in a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/un-urges-drc-to-prosecute-perpetrators-of-mass-rapes.php">mass rape of 387 DRC citizens</a> [JURIST report]. HRW had high praise for <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-kenya">Kenya</a> [HRW report] and their continuous reforms since violence in the nation several years ago. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-rwanda">Rwanda</a> [HRW report] was also praised for reforms, although the report noted that the freedom of expression is "severely restricted" in the nation, and that the legacy of the <a href = "http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] is mixed, "with a number of positive achievements&#8212;including the swift work of the courts, the extensive participation of the local population, and the revelation of information about events during 1994&#8212;alongside violations of the right to a fair trial, intimidation of witnesses, corruption of judges and other parties, and political interference." <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-somalia">Somalia</a> [HRW report] and its civil war was surveyed, with HRW noting the nation's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/war-crimes-affecting-somalia-children-ai.php">continued widespread abuse of children</a> [JURIST report], including the use of child soldiers. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-uganda">Uganda</a> [HRW report] was condemned for an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/uganda-chief-justice-says-judiciary-not-free.php">unstable judiciary</a>, a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/amnesty-international-criticises-uganda-human-rights-violations.php">lack of free speech rights</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">violence against LGBT citizens</a> [JURIST reports].</p>

<p>South America and Mexico's human rights violations continue to be largely in the realms of free speech and judicial and martial independence from corruption. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-argentina">Argentina</a> [HRW report], although praised for <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/argentina-ex-military-officers-sentenced-to-life-for-crimes-against-humanity.php">successful prosecutions of war criminals</a> [JURIST report], was chided for poor prison conditions and limitations on women's reproductive rights. The report decried <A href = "/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-representative-calls-for-peace-in-colombia.php">rampant violence</a> [JURIST report] in <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/colombia">Colombia</a> [HRW report], while also criticizing the US government's attempts at aid as being largely unchecked: "Thirty percent of US military aid is subject to human rights conditions, which the US Department of State has not enforced. In September 2011 the State Department certified that Colombia was meeting human rights conditions." The report also questioned the effectiveness of a recent <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/us-lawmakers-approve-free-trade-agreements-with-colombia-panama-south-korea.php">trade agreement</a> [JURIST report] between the US and Colombia. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-cuba">Cuba</a> [HRW report], which the report declared "the only country in Latin America that represses virtually all forms of political dissent," was chastised for its record of arbitrary arrests, detentions and taking of political prisoners, including US citizen <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/cuba-high-court-upholds-us-contractors-15-year-sentence.php">Alan Gross</a> [JURIST report]. The report noted that <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/haiti">Haiti</a> [HRW report], still reeling from its 2010 earthquake, not only has to restore the country's basic infrastructure and health needs, but also continues a lamentable human rights record, and expressed concern that the nation's judiciary could not handle the prosecution of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-urges-haiti-authorities-to-prosecute-former-haiti-president.php">Jean-Claude Duvalier</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-venezuela">Venezuela</a> [HRW report] and <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10086210">President Hugo Chavez</a> [BBC profile] were criticized for a "political takeover" of the nation's Supreme Court, which recently ruled that an <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/venezuela-high-court-rules-opposition-candidate-ineligible-to-run-for-president.php">opposition candidate was ineligible to run for president</a> [JURIST report]. Finally, <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/mexico">Mexico</a> and its <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/mexico-security-forces-committing-rights-abuses-hrw.php">security forces</a> [JURIST report] reactions to increasing homicides concerned HRW.</p>

<p>Finally, many Asian countries reportedly continue to struggle with basic rights of political expression. The report doled out strong criticism for <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> [HRW report] and its continued support of war lords as well as "flawed parliamentary elections." HRW commanded <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> [HRW report] to end its policies of torture and <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/bangladesh-must-end-extrajudicial-killings-ai.php">extrajudicial killings</a> and called into question the competency of recent <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/bangladesh-opposition-leader-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity.php">war crimes trials</a> [JURIST reports]. The report chastised <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-13006542">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] of <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-cambodia">Cambodia</a> [HRW report] for undermining the nation's <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/un-calls-on-cambodia-to-appoint-an-international-judge-to-genocide-tribunal.php">Khmer Rouge trials</a> [JURIST report]. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-china">China</a> and <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-north-korea">North Korea</a> [HRW report] were named as especially egregious violators of human rights, especially freedom of speech, but reporting in the private nations remains difficult. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-india">India</a> and the <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-philippines">Philippines</a> [HRW reports], often seen as relatively stable democracies, were criticized for corruption and deficits in the rule of law, as well as troubling records on women's rights. HRW labeled <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-pakistan">Pakistan</a> [HRW report] as having a "disastrous year," rife with civil discontent, military and guerrilla attacks on citizens and persecution of religious minorities. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-sri-lanka">Sri Lanka</a> [HRW report] continues to rebound from a civil war, although HRW is concerned that the government's <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/sri-lanka-report-says-military-did-not-target-civilians.php">investigations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] has not been credible enough. Finally, <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-vietnam">Vietnam</a> [HRW report] and its continued suppression of <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/vietnam-appeals-court-reduces-sentence-of-pro-democracy-blogger.php">bloggers</a>, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/vietnam-appeals-court-upholds-7-year-sentence-for-prominent-rights-lawyer.php">rights activists</a> [JURIST reports] and journalists was denounced, and HRW attributed the recent obstruction of media to "Vietnamese government concerns that pro-democracy ... movement might reach Asia."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1314535.pdf">Uhuru Kenyatta</a> and former Education Minister <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc1314543.pdf">William Ruto</a> [decisions, PDF], who both plan to run for president next year, were among the four suspects charged. The ICC reached this decision after collectively and individually analyzing the evidence presented. More than 1,000 people were killed during the post-election violence in Kenya. The ICC stated:<blockquote>With respect to the crimes charged and based on the evidence placed before it, the Chamber found that the Prosecutor has established substantial grounds to believe that the crimes against humanity of murder, deportation or forcible transfer and persecution were committed. These crimes resulted in the death of hundreds, and the displacement of thousands of civilians from Turbo town, the greater Eldoret area, Kapsabet town and Nandi Hills.</blockquote>The ICC hopes that this decision brings peace to the people of Kenya.

<p>In October, defense counsel for three Kenyan leaders charged in the ICC with <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/kenya-leaders-icc-prosecutors-failed-to-investigate-evidence.php">inciting violence</a> [JURIST report] after the December 2007 Kenyan elections argued that prosecutors had not fully investigated evidence that they planned to present at trial. In June, Kenyan Attorney General Amos Wako <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/kenya-appeals-icc-decision-on-jurisdiction-for-post-election-violence-cases.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] the refusal by the ICC to transfer the cases to Kenyan jurisdiction. In response, the ICC called for a hearing "to properly assess the desirability and feasibility of conducting the confirmation of charges hearings in the Republic of Kenya." In March, The ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/icc-summons-6-kenya-post-election-violence-suspects.php">issued summons</a> [JURIST report] for six Kenyans suspected of inciting the 2007-2008 post-election violence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Jones</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the government's attachment of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gps">global positioning system</a> (GPS) [JURIST news archive] device to a vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, constitutes a search under the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text]. The federal government <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/government-asks-supreme-court-to-rule-on-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">sought Supreme Court review</a> after the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-warrantless-gps-tracking.php">ruled</a> [JURIST reports] in 2010 that prolonged use of GPS to monitor suspects' vehicles violates the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Affirming the decision below, Justice Antonin Scalia delivered the opinion of the court, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor:<blockquote>It is important to be clear about what occurred in this case: The Government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was adopted.</blockquote>Sotomayor also filed a concurring opinion. Justice Samuel Alito filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. Alito "would analyze the question presented in this case by asking whether respondent's reasonable expectations of privacy were violated by the long-term monitoring of the movements of the vehicle he drove."

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-gps-tracking-prosecutorial-misconduct.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November. The government argued that under <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/460/276/">US v. Knotts</a> [opinion text], a GPS tracker is as permissible as monitoring a car by using a beeper inside the car for tracking purposes. Respondent's attorney argued that placing the GPS in the car created a seizure of the vehicle. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/jim-harper"">Jim Harper</a> [professional profile], Director of Information Policy Studies at the <a href="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</a>, argued in a piece for JURIST that the Supreme Court should use <span class="casename">US v. Jones</span> as an opportunity to reaffirm Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, particularly in light of technological advances.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Huff</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] allowing police officers to enter a private residence without a warrant if they have a reason to anticipate violence. The parents of a high school student brought the suit, arguing that the police department violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] when officers entered their home without a warrant. The officers arrived at the home after the student's principal asked them to investigate the student's alleged shooting threat. The student's mother resisted answering the officers' questions, including whether there was a weapon in the home. When the mother turned away from the police and re-entered the home, the officers followed her inside and left after determining that there was no threat. The court relied on its 2006 ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-502.pdf">Brigham City v. Stuart</a> [opinion, PDF] to conclude that the officers correctly applied the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment:<blockquote>In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners' position could have come to the conclusion that the Fourth Amendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if there was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that violence was imminent. And a reasonable officer could have come to such a conclusion based on the facts...</blockquote>The decision reversed the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that the student's mother exercised her right to end the conversation with the police and that the officers could <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Huff_v_City_of_Burbank_632_F3d_539_9th_Cir_2011_Court_Opinion">not have reasonably believed that there was an imminent threat</a> [opinion, PDF] inside the home.

<p>The court also upheld the emergency aid exception to the Fourth Amendment in its 2009 ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/09-91.pdf">Michigan v. Fisher</a> [opinion, PDF], which <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/supreme-court-rules-on-emergency-aid.php">reversed and remanded</a> [JURIST report] a Michigan Court of Appeals decision that found officers violated a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights when they entered his home. The case arose when officers called to the home of Jeremy Fisher found a dented vehicle outside the home and blood on the vehicle and on clothing inside the vehicle. They observed Fisher through a window throwing objects and one of the officers entered the home, at which time Fisher pointed a rifle at the officer. Fisher was charged with assault and possession of a firearm during a felony and sought to suppress the officer's statement, arguing that the entry was illegal.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The remaining 1 percent of the ballots were invalid. Approximately 47 percent of eligible voters participated in the decision. Turnout was among the lowest of EU member states that held accession referendums prior to joining the EU. In response to the referendum, the EU released a statement: "with this vote, Croatia's citizens have given their endorsement to European integration. We congratulate Croatia and its people on their choice: EU membership will open up new opportunities for them and help secure the stability and prosperity of their nation." Croatia will become the EU's twenty-eighth member on July 1, 2013.

Harris</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&_Policies/Federal_Meat_Inspection_Act/index.asp">Federal Meat Inspection Act</a> (FMIA) [text], which requires observation of animals that are unable to walk for possible disease, preempts a subsequent <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/PEN/3/1/14/s599f">California law</a> [Cal Pen Code &#167; 599f text] requiring slaughterhouses to "immediately euthanize" on its premises any such animals. The court ruled that the FMIA preemption clause prohibits states from creating and enforcing laws that fall within the scope of the federal requirements, even if the state law does not conflict with the federal law:<blockquote>The FMIA regulates slaughterhouses' handling and treatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their delivery through the end of the meat production process. California's &#167;599f endeavors to regulate the same thing, at the same time, in the same place&#8212;except by imposing different requirements. The FMIA expressly preempts such a state law.</blockquote>The court reversed the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/31/09-15483.pdf">ruling</a> [opinion, PDF] that the California law was not preempted. 

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-preemption.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in November and seemed skeptical that there was no overlap in the purposes of the two laws. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-to-rule-on-fcc-indecency-policy.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in the case in June. The provisions of the California law were considered and expressly rejected by federal regulators because they eliminate certain federally required ante-mortem inspection of possibly diseased animals. The California legislature enacted the law to control the treatment of nonambulatory animals after a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhlhSQ5z4V4">2008 undercover video</a> [warning: graphic content] released by the <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/">Humane Society of the United States</a> [advocacy website] showed slaughterhouse employees dragging, kicking and applying electric shocks to sick animals to move them. </p>]]></content:encoded>

President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/obama-orders-guantanamo-prison-closed.php">ordered the facility closed</a> [JURIST report] by January 2010, but <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/us-house-rejects-domestic-transfer-of.php">congressional opposition</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/obama-signs-bill-allowing-transfer-of.php">administrative setbacks</a> [JURIST reports] prevented the administration from meeting the deadline. In addition, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/obama-signs-controversial-defense-bill.php">recently signed</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540ih.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for 2012</a> [HR 1540, PDF] effectively codifies indefinite military detention without charge or trial. Pillay said:<blockquote>While fully recognizing the right and duty of states to protect their people and territory from terrorist acts, I remind all branches of the US Government of their obligation under international human rights law to ensure that individuals deprived of their liberty can have the lawfulness of their detention reviewed before a court. Where credible evidence exists against Guantanamo detainees, they should be charged and prosecuted. Otherwise, they must be released.</blockquote> She also noted that international law requires investigation of alleged human rights violations, which includes the actions that allegedly took place at Guantanmo Bay. Pillay urged the US Congress to take steps enabling the Obama adminstration to close the facility. 

<p>January marks the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/guantanamo-bay-detention-facility-marks-its-tenth-anniversary-of-operation.php">tenth anniversary of operations at Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report].

There are currently <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/">171 detainees</a> [NYT docket] being held at Guantanamo. The Obama administration originally wanted suspected terrorists to be tried before a <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/holder-defends-plan-to-try-911-suspects.php">federal civilian court</a>, but <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/holder-announces-911-conspirators-to-face-military-trials.php">changed its position</a> after Congress imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/congress-approves-defense-spending-bill-preventing-us-trial-of-guantanamo-detainees.php">series of restrictions</a> [JURIST reports] barring the transfer of detainees to the US despite repeated appeals from rights groups to utilize civilian courts over military commissions.

Mohamed was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">arrested for corruption</a> [JURIST report] in an unprecedented move by the military, following the ruling to release a government critic. The arrest has sparked street protests and prompted all the country's courts to boycott sessions. The country's prosecutor general's office has said that under the constitution a judge can be arrested only after a supreme court decision to do so, and the supreme court, prosecutor general's office and judicial services commission (JSC) have all issued statements calling the arrest illegal and requesting Mohamed's release.

However, opposition legislators have blocked the ruling party's legislative agenda, leaving certain crucial provisions of the new constitutional system unestablished. This resulted in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10452297">resignation of Nasheed's entire cabinet</a> [BBC report] in June 2010. The <a href="http://www.maldivesinfo.gov.mv/home/upload/downloads/Compilation.pdf">Maldives Constitution</a> [text, PDF] provides for multi-party elections, an independent judiciary and grants more authority to the legislature.

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/smart/pdfs/final_sornaguidelines.pdf">Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act</a> (SORNA) [final guidelines, PDF] does not require pre-act offenders to register before the attorney general validly specifies that the act's registration provisions apply to them. The attorney general determined in 2007 that all states would have to follow the federal rule to keep registration current. Billy Joe Reynolds pleaded guilty for failure to register his new address but attempted to challenge the application of SORNA against him because his sex offender conviction in 2001 predated the attorney general's rule change. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/084747np.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that this did not give him standing to challenge the rule's application. In an opinion delivered by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court reversed:<blockquote>The Act defines the term "sex offender" as including these pre-Act offenders. ... It says that "[a] sex offender shall register." ... And it further says that "<em>[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements</em> ... to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this chapter ...." ... In our view, these provisions, read together, mean that the Act's registration requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders until the Attorney General specifies that they do apply.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

<p>In June, the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court.php">US v. Juvenile Male</a> [JURIST report] that the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had no authority to rule that the requirements SORNA violate the <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/ex_post_facto">ex post facto</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] clause of the Constitution when applied to juveniles adjudicated as delinquent before SORNA's enactment. In 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-sex-offender-registration-law-does-not-apply-retroactively.php">Carr v. United States</a> [JURIST report] that the failure to register provision of SORNA does not apply retroactively to offenses occurring before SORNA's enactment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wuterich was charged with voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, obstruction of justice and dereliction of duty in court-martial proceedings that began less than two weeks ago. All of the charges except dereliction of duty have been dropped in return for his guilty plea. Wuterich was <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gA-LpmS5c2KiA6PKwiTGrwERD5ZA?docId=CNG.83fcabb172c89120004a1e0d90be7afd.371">accused of overreacting</a> [AFP report] to the death of another marine in a roadside bombing in Haditha, Iraq, and allegedly ordering his men to 'shoot first and ask questions later.' He sent his men into nearby houses to search for insurgents, which resulted in the deaths of the Iraqi civilians, including 10 women and children. Seven other marines were charged in 2006 with crimes relating to the incident, but in six cases charges were dismissed and one marine was acquitted. Wuterich will be sentenced by a military judge at a later date.

<p>Wuterich was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-set-for.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] his charges in 2010. His trial was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-court.php">postponed in 2008</a> [JURIST report] after a judge decided to throw out a subpoena for unaired footage of a CBS interview with Wuterich that prosecutors believed could have proven his guilt.

The Senate voted <a href="http://www.senat.fr/les_actus_en_detail/article/penalisation-de-la-negation-du-genocide-armenien.html">126-86</a> [press release, in French] in favor of the bill, despite a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/france-senate-panel-rejects-genocide-denial-ban.php">Senate committee rejecting the bill</a> [JURIST report] last week and raising constitutionality concerns. The French <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">National Assembly</a> [official website, in French] last month <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/france-lower-house-approves-genocide-denial-ban.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report], which imposes a one-year prison term, a 45,000-euro fine, or both, on individuals who publicly trivialize or deny genocide crimes. The measure has sparked animosity in Turkey, which does not classify the killings as a genocide. Turkish <a href="http://www.basbakanlik.gov.tr/Forms/pMain.aspx">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official website, in Turkish]<correction num=1> </correction>Tuesday <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/01/24/turkey-rages-at-satan-sarkozy-over-racist-french-bill-criminalizing-genocide-denial/">criticized the French parliament</a> [Reuters report] and the proposed law, calling it "discriminatory and racist." The bill now moves to French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/lepresident/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official profile, in French; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=sarkozy">news archive</a>] for final approval before becoming law. 

<p>The Armenian genocide is also a contentious issue in US law and politics. In November the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ninth-circuit-to-rehear-armenia-genocide-lawsuit.php">revisit a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether a California law declaring Armenian genocide in Turkey conflicts with US foreign policy. In August 2010 a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-over-armenian-genocide-curriculum.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the exclusion of materials questioning the Armenian genocide from a school curriculum. In March 2010 the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">announced its opposition to a resolution</a> [JURIST report] labeling the World War I-era killings as genocide. The announcement came after the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 23-22. Erdogan condemned the resolution, and the Turkish government recalled its ambassador to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Garzon has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">charged with abusing power</a> [JURIST report] by opening an investigation into war crimes allegedly committed under <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a> [BBC backgrounder] during the Spanish Civil War. In 2008, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordered the exhumation</a> [JURIST report] of 19 mass graves in Spain in order to assemble a definitive national registry of Civil War victims, despite a 1977 law that provides amnesty for Franco-era crimes. Garzon has consistently <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/spain-judge-garzon-defends-2008-franco.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] the validity of the investigation by insisting that he acted within the bounds of the law and appropriately applied the law at all times.

If convicted, Garzon could face a suspension of up to 20 years. 

<p>Last March, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/spain-judge-garzon-petitions-europe-rights-court-over-franco-probe.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging the 2010 abuse of power charges, for which he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-judicial-panel-suspends-judge-garzon-over-franco-probe.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report]. His petition follows the September 2010 decision of the Criminal Chamber of the Spanish Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/spain-high-court-confirms-decision-against-judge-garzon-in-franco-probe.php">unanimously confirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court order that Garzon abused his power and must face trial.

Mugesera, who has been fighting deportation from Canada since 1995, is a former Rwandan politician accused of delivering a speech in 1992 urging fellow Hutus to murder members of the Tutsi minority. Many Rwandans believe Mugesera's speech <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16694130">directly led to the mass killings</a> [BBC report] which occurred during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rwanda+genocide">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Canadian government originally sought to deport Mugesera in 1995 after they determined that he omitted material facts in his application for asylum. The government also determined that Mugesera should be deported because there was a reasonable basis to believe he had incited murder, genocide and crimes against humanity. In 2005, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that Mugesera <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/canadian-high-court-says-rwandan.php">must be deported</a>, although the Canadian government later indicated he would not be extradited unless the Rwandan government <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/no-deportation-of-rwanda-war-crimes.php">guaranteed not to seek the death penalty</a> [JURIST reports] in the event of a conviction. In a final effort to avoid deportation, which some commentators had <a href="/forum/2012/01/charles-jalloh-mugesera.php">called "inevitable"</a> [JURIST op-ed], Mugesera appealed to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/">UN Committee Against Torture</a> [official website], claiming he would face <a href="http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mugesera-returns-to-rwanda/article2311566/?service=mobile">torture and possible death if removed to Rwanda</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report]. Mugesera also asked the Canadian courts not to rule on his final appeals until the UN committee had reached its decision. Superior Court Judge Michel Delorme ruled that immigration issues <a href="http://montreal.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20120124/mtl_mugesera_120124/20120124/?hub=MontrealHome">must be determined by the federal courts</a> [CTV Montreal report], not provincial courts, and that agreeing to hear the case would lead to forum shopping. Mugesera was deported hours after the court issued its final ruling. 

<p>While the Canadian government chose to pursue deportation of Mugesera, they have the authority under the country's <a href="http://www.iccnow.org/documents/Canada.CrAgH.WcrEng.pdf">Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act</a> [text, PDF] to prosecute individuals living in Canada who are suspected of involvement with genocide. In November 2009, Canadian prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/canada-prosecutors-charge-second-rwanda.php">announced they were charging</a> [JURIST report] Rwandan national Jacques Mungwarere under the law for his potential involvement in the Rwandan genocide. Mungwarere was the second man charged under the act. The first man charged under the act was Desire Munyaneza. In October 2009, Munyaneza was <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/canada-court-sentences-rwanda-war.php">sentenced to life imprisonment</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. Munyaneza was <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/rwandan-hutu-first-to-be-convicted.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009 of seven counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes under the act. He was <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/canadian-authorities-charge-rwandan.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in 2005 by Canadian police after a five-year investigation. The trial, which was briefly <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/canada-trial-of-rwanda-war-crimes.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] after Munyaneza was beaten by a fellow prison inmate, lasted two years and included evidence from multiple nations. International legal observers expect Munyaneza's trial to set precedent for future war crimes litigation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontpadilla.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> on Monday <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/4th_circuit_opinion.pdf">upheld the dismissal</a> [opinion, PDF] of a lawsuit brought by US citizen and convicted terrorist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2037444.stm">Jose Padilla</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/padilla.php">news archive</a>], who alleged that he had been illegally detained at a military jail in South Carolina. Claiming nominal monetary redress against Secretary of Defense <a href="http://www.defense.gov/bios/biographydetail.aspx?biographyid=310">Leon Panetta</a> [official profile] and former secretary <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3690341.stm">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [BBC profile], among others, Padilla argued that the Defense Department's methods of detaining him as an "enemy combatant" were unconstitutional. The Fourth Circuit disagreed and held that Padilla could not use a lawsuit seeking monetary damages to review an issue involving national security and that the judiciary was not the proper forum to rule on the legislature-adopted policies responsible for his detention. The court reasoned that allowing such lawsuits "would expose past executive deliberations affecting sensitive matters of national security to the prospect of searching judicial scrutiny." The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], which brought the suit on Padilla's behalf, was quick to express its <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-statement-ruling-padilla-v-rumsfeld-appeal">discontent with the ruling</a> [statement]:<blockquote>Today is a sad day for the rule of law and for those who believe that the courts should protect American citizens from torture by their own government. By dismissing this lawsuit, the appeals court handed the government a blank check to commit any abuse in the name of national security, even the brutal torture of a US citizen on US soil. This impunity is not only anathema to a democracy governed by laws, but contrary to history's lesson that in times of fear our values are a strength, not a hindrance.</blockquote>Padilla's case, filed pursuant to <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/388/case.html">Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics</a> [opinion], was originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/federal-judge-dismisses-padilla-torture-suit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in February by the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website], which ruled that the defendants had qualified immunity under the circumstances. Padilla was arrested in 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and thereafter detained as an enemy combatant. He was <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/padilla-convicted-in-federal-terror.php">convicted</a> on terrorism charges in 2007 and <a href="/paperchase/2007/08/padilla-convicted-in-federal-terror.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] to 17 years in prison.

<p>This is the latest case involving the liability of government officials for their actions in the US War on Terror. In August, the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-allows-rumsfeld-torture-suit-to-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a torture lawsuit against former secretary Rumsfeld by two American citizens may proceed under the cause of action recognized in <span class="casename">Bivens</span>. Also in August, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-allows-US-intelligence-officers-suit-against-rumsfeld.php">allowed a lawsuit to be brought against Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST report] by a former US military contractor who alleged that he had been tortured while imprisoned in Iraq. By contrast, the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] in 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-rumsfeld-torture-suit.php">upheld the dismissal</a> [JURIST report] of a suit against Rumsfeld brought by Afghan and Iraqi citizens who claimed that they were illegally detained and tortured. Also in 2011, the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that former US attorney general <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1120440.stm">John Ashcroft</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ashcroft.php">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-ashcroft-immune-from-suit-over-witness-detention.php">immune from a suit</a> [JURIST report] involving allegedly unconstitutional witness detention, and that he should be entitled to absolute immunity where there is no clear violation of established law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

All 34 executions occurred on a single day for crimes described as <a href="http://www.moj.gov.iq/">terrorism-related offenses</a> [Iraq Ministry of Justice, in Arabic]. Iraq maintains the death penalty for even non-fatal crimes, but there has been no report of a single case in which the death penalty was pardoned, according to Pillay:<blockquote>The total number of individuals sentenced to death in Iraq since 2004 is believed to stand at more than 1,200. The total number actually executed since then is not known, although at least 63 individuals are thought to have been executed in the past two months alone (since 16 November). There are around 48 crimes for which the death penalty can be imposed in Iraq, including a number of non-fatal crimes such as&#8212;under certain circumstances&#8212;damage to public property.</blockquote>Iraq's current system of death penalty and its far-reaching coverage of offenses that are subject to death penalty creates doubt on the due process and fairness of trials in the country. The High Commissioner urged the government to establish an immediate moratorium on the use of the death penalty.

<p>In 2007, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] approved a resolution <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/un-general-assembly-to-consider.php">calling for a worldwide moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty. The resolution was reaffirmed twice by resolutions <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/63/168">A/RES/63/168</a> and <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/65/206">A/RES/65/206</a> [materials] in 2008 and 2010, respectively. It was <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/opponents-argue-against-un-death.php">criticized by countries</a> [JURIST report] that supported the use of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=death+penalty">death penalty</a> [JURIST news archive], alleging that the resolution would infringe nations' sovereignty. Iraq, one of the countries that did not implement the moratorium, has been subject to criticism for violating various human rights including <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/iraq-unlawfully-holding-torturing-thousands-of-detainees-report.php">unlawfully detaining</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/iraq-detainees-tortured-in-secret.php">repeatedly torturing</a> thousands of detainees <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/sunnis-held-without-warrant-tortured-in.php">without warrants</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs are three same-sex couples who were married in Canada and had been denied marriage licenses by Minnesota due to a statewide ban on <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=same-sex+marriage">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST news archive]. Plaintiffs <a href="http://marrymeminnesota.org/files/AppealBrief_1_.pdf">argued</a> [appellate brief, PDF] that Minnesota violated their equal protection rights by refusing to issue them marriage licenses. The appeals remanded the case to the trial court because the trial court had not adequately addressed plaintiffs' equal protection rights as well as a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14283825888588258352&q=baker+v.+nelson&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">1971 Minnesota case</a> [<span class="casename">Baker v. Nelson</span>, PDF] that upheld the state's ban on same-sex marriage:<blockquote>The district court failed to address appellants' challenges under the Minnesota Constitution. A proper analysis is necessary especially because the Minnesota rational-basis test for determining whether equal-protection rights have been violated is more stringent than the federal test. Additionally, the supreme court in <span class="casename">Baker</span> specifically stated that there was no guidance from decisions from the United States Supreme Court regarding whether the right to marry if a fundamental right of all persons and whether restricting marriage based solely on sex is "irrational and invidiously discriminatory."</blockquote>No date has been set for the ensuing trial in district court.

<p>It remains unclear if the court of appeals' decision to remand the case to the district court will help or hurt the plaintiffs. Phil Duran, the legal director of the gay rights group <a href="http://www.outfront.org/home">OutFront Minnesota</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.outfront.org/news?module=news&showitem=211">declared</a> [press release] that the decision could be a setback for same-sex marriage rights because the case could eventually be decided by the deeply conservative Minnesota Supreme Court. Douglas Benson, one of the plaintiffs in the case, took a more optimistic view, saying that the court of appeals' decision <a href="http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/137900878.html">gives the plaintiffs momentum going forward in court</a> [<em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em> report]. Same-sex marriage is a particularly contentious issue in Minnesota this year, as voters will decide in November whether to accept or reject a <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bin/bldbill.php?bill=H1613.0.html&session=ls87">constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage</a> [HF 1613 text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/minnestoa-legislator-ballot-measure-banning-same-sex-marriage.php">report</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Tantawi made the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-16704551">announcement</a> [BBC report] on the anniversary of the start of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">Egyptian revolution</a> [JURIST news archive], which led former Egyptian president <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">news archive</a>] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">step down from the office</a> [JURIST report] in February of last year.

The plaintiffs argued that the federal raids violated their protection under the state law. Molloy, however, found that providers could be prosecuted under federal law, following the precedent set by the Supreme Court in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZS.html">Gonzales v. Raich</a> [opinion] in 2005. In that case, the Court held that the Supremacy Clause applies to medical marijuana laws. The Montana <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/2011/billhtml/SB0423.htm">law</a> [SB 423, text], which was enacted in 2011, allowed for the cultivation and production of the drug as long as a registration card was obtained. Molloy held that the Supremacy Clause allowed federal law to trump the state law. 

<p>Federal courts have been cracking down on state medical marijuana laws recently. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-judge-grants-aclu-motion-to-dismiss-arizona-medical-marijuana-challenge.php"> granted a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by the Arizona Governor. The Governor believed an Arizona medical marijuana law placed lawmakers at risk of federal prosecution for implementing the law. In October, medical marijuana advocates <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/california-marijuana-advocates-file-suit-against-federal-government.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in a California federal court seeking relief against the federal government for its crackdown on marijuana dispensaries in the state. In June, a judge in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ontario-appeals-court-stays-marijuana-possession-ruling.php">stayed a ruling</a> [JURIST report] finding that the country's marijuana laws were unconstitutional. In January 2010, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-rejects.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legal team is <a href="http://minivannews.com/politics/lawyers-forward-chief-judges-case-to-international-criminal-court-31113">contesting</a> [<em>Minivan News</em> report] the conditions of Mohamed's <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">arrest and subsequent detention</a> [JURIST report] by the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) after the judge attempted to block his own High Court police summons pertaining to allegations of corruption and political bias in his professional conduct. The national Judicial Services Commission (JSC) has stated that the MNDF does <a href="http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39897">not have legal authority over the judiciary</a> [<em>HaveeruOnline</em> report], a responsibility claimed exclusively by the JSC itself. On Tuesday the Maldives Attorney General and JSC member Abdulla Muizzu <a href="http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39916">gave his first interview since the arrest</a> [<em>HaveeruOnline</em> report], but chose to confine his remarks to addressing the JSC's failure to effectively address various complaints against Mohamed's conduct, refusing entirely to address the constitutional issues pertaining to the judge's actual arrest. The JSC has <a href="http://minivannews.com/politics/jsc-appeals-civil-court-injunction-against-investigation-of-abdulla-mohamed-31176">appealed an earlier Civil Court injunction</a> [<em>Minivan News</em> report] preventing the commission from taking action against Mohamed at the High Court, and is now investigating all previously submitted complaints against Mohamed. Violent anti-government <a href="http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/39917">protests have left several injured</a> [<em>HaveeruOnline</em> report], including a journalist badly beaten Monday at a rally near the camp of the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party. While opposition parties have termed Mohamed's arrest a "kidnapping" and claimed his continued detention constitutes a "crime against humanity" under the ICC's jurisdiction, the ICC limits itself under the Rome Statute to only the most serious international crimes.

<p>This week the Maldives <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.mv/new/">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] requested the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-seeks-un-help-to-resolve-detention-of-senior-judge.php">UN help resolve</a> [JURIST report] the situation, which they are calling a judicial system failure. The Maldives has faced ongoing political difficulties following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/maldives-president-signs-new.php">adoption of its constitution</a> [JURIST report] in late 2008. <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/4/?ref=2,8,0">President Mohamed Nasheed</a> [official website] defeated longtime political opponent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7658672.stm">Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</a> [BBC profile], who had jailed him numerous times during his 30-year rule. However, opposition legislators have blocked the ruling party's legislative agenda, leaving certain crucial provisions of the new constitutional system unestablished. This resulted in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10452297">resignation of Nasheed's entire cabinet</a> [BBC report] in June 2010. The <a href="http://www.maldivesinfo.gov.mv/home/upload/downloads/Compilation.pdf">Maldives Constitution</a> [text, PDF] provides for multi-party elections, an independent judiciary and grants more authority to the legislature. It also enumerates fundamental rights of citizens and establishes several special commissions on issues relating to human rights and corruption. The new constitution was drafted in response to <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/publications/AmnestyReport.pdf">international criticism</a> [AI report, PDF] of 2003 government actions against protesters of prison conditions in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Laurent Kasper-Ansermet is the judge tasked with investigating two possible suspects believed to be involved in the deaths of around 1.7 million people during the reign of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder] regime. The investigation relates to ECCC cases <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/286">003</a> and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/98">004</a> [materials]. The Cambodian government strongly opposes the investigation into the suspects' involvement with the Khmer Rouge. Cambodia attempted to block Kasper-Ansermet's return to the country under an agreement between the UN and the Cambodian government. Cambodian officials said they believe they have the authority to reject investigating judges they deem unsuitable. Cambodia says Kasper-Ansermet is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/25/us-cambodia-rouge-idUSTRE80O12K20120125">unsuitable to continue the investigation</a> [Reuters report] because he used his Twitter account to comment on the cases. According to the UN, the agreement between the Cambodian government and the UN gives "full authority to operate as the international investigating judge." 

<p>Last week, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-calls-on-cambodia-to-appoint-an-international-judge-to-genocide-tribunal.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over Cambodia's decision to not appoint the reserve judge Kasper-Ansermet to the ECCC after the previous judge, Siegfried Blunk, <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-judge-resigns-from-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] in October. ECCC judges, including Blunk, have been criticized for allegedly failing to conduct impartial investigations. Cambodia has argued that the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders is a Cambodian issue and should not be a matter of international concern. Also in October, defense lawyers for accused Khmer Rouge leader Nuon Chea <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/khmer-rouge-leader-defense-team-files-suit-against-cambodia-pm.php">filed a lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] against Cambodian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] for interfering with the UN-backed war crimes tribunal. Nuon's lawyers accused the prime minister of criminally <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/idINIndia-60088720111024">conspiring to block some of the defense witnesses from testifying</a> [Reuters report] and consequently interfering with his right to a fair trial. In September, the ECCC ordered the trials be <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-separate-trials-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">split into a series of smaller trials</a> [JURIST report].<br />

The order permits "extended media coverage" in courtrooms, which entails broadcasting of proceedings by the use of television, radio, photographic or recording equipment for the purpose of gathering and disseminating news to the public. While Illinois has permitted the use of news cameras in its Supreme Court and appellate courts since 1983, it has not allowed news cameras in trial courts until this decision. Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Kilbride championed the new policy: <blockquote>This is another step to bring more transparency and more accountability to the Illinois court system. The provisions of this new policy keep discretion in the chief circuit judge and the trial judge to assure that a fair and impartial trial is not compromised, yet affords a closer look at the workings of our court system to the public through the eyes of the electronic news media and news photographers.</blockquote> Prior to the order, Illinois was one of 14 states that either banned or severely restricted camera use in trial courtrooms.

<p>The presence of cameras and other recording devices in courtrooms has generated substantial controversy both in the US and abroad. In December, the US Senate Judiciary Committee returned to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-senate-debates-requiring-televised-broadcasts-of-supreme-court-proceedings.php">longstanding debate</a> [JURIST report] over whether to televise the proceedings of the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], including whether Congress, as an equal branch of government, has the authority to require the court to admit cameras. In November, <a href="http://www.c-span.org/">C-SPAN</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.c-span.org/uploadedFiles/Content/Documents/SCOTUS-Healthcare-TV-Coverage.pdf">asked</a> [letter text, PDF] the US Supreme Court to drop its ban on cameras in the courtroom when it hears arguments over the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=patient+protection+and+affordable+care+act">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [JURIST news archive]. In September, the UK Justice Secretary <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/uk-to-allow-cameras-in-criminal-courts.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that cameras would be allowed in UK and Wales courts in an effort to increase judicial transparency. In October 2010, a coalition of 37 public interest groups <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/-telrights-groups-urge-senate-to-pass-bill-allowing-cameras-in-supreme-court.php">urged the US Senate to permit television coverage of Supreme Court proceedings</a> [JURIST report]. In September 2010, US Federal judges <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judges-approve-pilot-project-to-televise-civil-trials.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on a pilot project to allow certain civil trials to be televised. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a retrial of a 2010 case, the court found the four defendants <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/four_former_yugoslav_army_soldiers_jailed_in_montenegro_for_war_crimes/24462924.html">guilty of torturing prisoners</a> [RFE/RL report] at a detention camp in Morinj between 1991 and 1992. The defendants were four of the six lower-ranking JNA soldiers who were <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/15/us-montenegro-warcrimes-idUSTRE64E0X920100515">convicted in May 2010</a> [Reuters report] for the torture of Croatian prisoners detained during a conflict in Dubrovnik. This decision was <a href="http://world-countries.net/archives/102714">overturned on appeal</a> [SETimes.com report], and two defendants were acquitted in the retrial. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] continues to prosecute former high-ranking Yugoslav army soldiers for war crimes. Last September, ex-Yugoslav army chief <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/perisic/cis/en/cis_perisic_en.pdf">Momcilo Perisic</a> [ICTY profile, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=perisic">news archive</a>] was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/icty-sentences-former-yugoslav-army-chief-to-27-years.php">convicted for crimes against humanity and war crimes</a> [JURIST report], committed during the wars in Bosnia and Croatia and sentenced to 27 years in prison. Former Yugoslav National Army officer <a href="http://www.trial-ch.org/en/trial-watch/profile/db/facts/miroslav_radic_231.html">Miroslav Radic</a> [Trial Watch backgrounder], was <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/icty-convicts-leader-in-vukovar.php">acquitted of war crimes charges</a> [JURIST report] brought by the ICTY in 2007.

While Vukoic's appeal was denied, Zoran Tomic won his appeal on a lack of evidence. As a member of the 2nd Sekovici Special Police Detachment, the court found that Vukovic participated in executing 1,000 Bosniak men who were imprisoned in a warehouse. This was Vukovic's final appeal.

<p>Earlier this week, convicted Serbian <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/radovan-stankovic-arrested-after-4-years-on-the-run.php">war criminal Radovan Stankovic</a> [JURIST report] was arrested in BiH after being on the run since May 2007 when he escaped from a Bosnian prison.

The <a href="http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?id=104&idl=1">Romanian Parliament</a> [official website, in Romanian] <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/news/world/detail/121166/">passed the law in December</a> [AP report], but objections from opposition leaders and anti-government protesters followed. The opposition argued that the law would facilitate fraud, cheating and confusion in the election process, while the government claimed the law would cuts costs by permitting one ballot for two elections. After the ruling, Romanian <a href="http://www.presidency.ro/">President Traian Basescu</a> [official website, in Romanian] <a href="http://www.presidency.ro/?lang=ro">defended his administration</a> [speech text, in Romanian] amid protests against the government's education, justice, criminal and economic policies. 

<p>Romanian elections have garnered discontent in recent years. The high court <a href="http://www.ccr.ro/alegeri/2009/comunicate/14decembrie.pdf">declared</a> [press release, PDF; in Romanian] incumbent Basescu <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/romania-court-declares-incumbent-winner.php">winner of the country's disputed presidential election</a> [JURIST report] in December 2009. The court unanimously rejected a complaint by Basescu's opponent, Social Democrat <a href="http://www.mirceageoana.ro/">Mircea Geoana</a> [campaign website, in Romanian], to declare the results of the runoff election invalid because of allegations of voter fraud and bribery. After the first round of elections in November produced no clear winner, Basescu and Geoana faced a runoff election. Official results showed that Basescu had won by a mere 70,000 votes, garnering 50.3 percent of the total votes, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/romania-constitutional-court-orders.php">ordered election officials to recount</a> [JURIST report] 138,000 voided ballots. In 2007, <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/romania-president-reinstated-after.php">Basescu was reinstated</a> [JURIST report] after the constitutional court certified results of a referendum where 74 percent of voters <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/romanians-reject-referendum-bid-to.php">rejected Basescu's impeachment</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The state is asking the court to overturn the district court ruling blocking two provisions of the law and to allow the entirety of the law to take effect. The request comes after a judge for the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] placed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-judge-halts-south-carolina-immigration-lawsuit.php">hold on the lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the immigration law pending the outcome of a similar case to be heard by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in December to rule on Arizona's controversial immigration law <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">granting <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-182.htm">Arizona v. United States</a> [docket] to determine if Arizona's law is preempted by federal law. The South Carolina law was scheduled to take effect on January 1.

<p>In December of last year, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-blocks-portions-of-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] portions of the South Carolina law. Judge Richard Gergel blocked the provision that requires police to check immigration status, finding, "[t]his state-mandated scrutiny is without consideration of federal enforcement priorities and unquestionably vastly expands the persons targeted for immigration enforcement action. He also blocked the provision that outlaws harboring or transporting an illegal immigrant, finding a likelihood of irreparable harm. Similar immigration laws are being challenged throughout the US. Also in December, Alabama and Georgia filed motions in the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] seeking to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/states-seek-to-delay-immigration-cases-pending-supreme-court-ruling.php">stay proceedings</a> [JURIST report] on challenges to their immigration laws pending the Supreme Court ruling in Arizona v. United States. A challenge is also pending to an immigration law in <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-utah-immigration-law.php">Utah</a>, and an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-judge-enjoins-indiana-immigration-law.php">Indiana law has been blocked</a> [JURIST reports] by a federal judge.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay first noted that the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">Libyan National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] has expressed their commitment to human rights and has taken encouraging steps in that direction in the form of legal reform and new legislation. However, the interim government still has not gained effective control over the revolutionary brigades and a concern remains over the conditions of detention and treatment of detainees held by these brigades:<blockquote>The [International Committee of the Red Cross] visited over 8,500 detainees in approximately 60 places of detention between March and December 2011. The majority of detainees are accused of being Gaddafi loyalists and include a large number of sub-Saharan African nationals. The lack of oversight by the central authorities creates an environment conducive to torture and ill-treatment. My staff have received alarming reports that this is happening in places of detention that they have visited.</blockquote>She urged that all detention centers be brought under the control of the Ministry of Justice and the General Prosecutor's Office. Pillay welcomed a commitment to transitional justice to address both abuses of the past and those committed during the conflict.

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread in the aftermath of the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libyan conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Earlier this month <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/middle-east-rights-groups-allege-human-rights-violations-in-libya.php">Middle East rights groups alleged human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] and that all parties involved, including the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website], committed acts ranging from use of excessive force against protesters to cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners during detention. They also urged support to the Libyan authorities in the implementation of section 12 of the <a href="http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_09/20110927_110916-UNSCR-2009.pdf">UN Security Council Resolution 2009</a> [text in PDF]. In September 2011, the Libyan NTC vowed to investigate allegations of human rights after <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the Libya conflict are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate these allegations. In August, <a href="http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/">Physicians for Human Rights</a> (PHR) [advocacy website] <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/Libya-WitnesstoWarCrimes-Aug2011.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] Libyan troops <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-troops-using-children-as-human-shields-report.php">used children as human shields</a> [JURIST report] to deter attacks by NATO. That same month, the Libyan Prime Minister Al Baghdad Ali Al-Mahmoudi requested that the UN create a "high-level commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">investigate alleged human rights abuses</a> [JURIST report] by NATO.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Government spokesman Ali al-Moussawi <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/26/us-iraq-massacre-idUSTRE80P1JA20120126">expressed displeasure</a> [Reuters report] with the outcome of the investigation and prosecutions in the US military court. On Tuesday, <a href="http://www.frankwuterich.com/">US Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/final-marine-tried-in-haditha-killings-pleads-guilty.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charge of negligent dereliction of duty, making him the only marine convicted of misconduct related to the killings. Eight marines were originally charged in relation to the killings, but in six cases charges were dismissed and one marine was acquitted. Earlier this week, many Iraqis were <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/01/24/uk-iraq-usa-haditha-idUKTRE80N1TE20120124">outraged</a> [Reuters report] by the lenient deal given to Wuterich, whose conviction carries a maximum sentence of three months in jail. Al-Moussawi did not specify what legal action the Iraqi government might take. 

<p>Wuterich's guilty plea marks the end of the final court-martial resulting from a five-year investigation into the 2005 Haditha killings. Wuterich was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-set-for.php">denied a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] his charges in 2010. His trial was <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/haditha-marine-squad-leader-court.php">postponed in 2008</a> [JURIST report] after a judge decided to throw out a subpoena for unaired footage of a CBS interview with Wuterich that prosecutors believed could have proven his guilt. Charges against <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=chessani">Lt. Colonel Jeffrey Chessani</a> [JURIST news archive] were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/military-judge-drops-charges-against-us.php">dropped</a> [JURIST report] in June 2008, the same month <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=andrew+grayson">1st Lt.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontdna.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/?page=550">Minnesota Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled Wednesday that a Minnesota statute requiring people convicted of crimes to submit a DNA sample <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/opinions/sc/current/OPA090247-0125.pdf">does not violate</a> [opinion, PDF] the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmentiv">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] right to unreasonable search. The <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bin/getpub.php?type=s&num=609.117">Minnesota law</a> [text], which was enacted in 2010, requires an offender to submit a DNA test, upon sentencing, before release from prison and upon transfer from another state. The appellant had been charged with a felony but agreed to take a sentence reduction in response to entering a guilty plea. He claimed that the DNA requirement violated his equal protection and should be considered an unreasonable search. The district court and the appellate court rejected that argument, and he appealed to the state's highest court. In Wednesday's opinion Justice Dietzen agreed with the lower court and held such a requirement was not a violation.<blockquote>The State's legitimate governmental interests outweigh appellant's reduced expectation of privacy following a misdemeanor conviction arising out of the same set of circumstances as his felony charge. We conclude that the physical intrusion of Johnson's bodily integrity to acquire the DNA sample is minimal, especially when compared to the other intrusions Johnson is subjected to as part of his probation.</blockquote>In the dissent, Justice Meyer stated that the collection of DNA constituted an intrusion upon personal security and dignity and instead found the privacy invasion highly intrusive. He would have found the DNA requirement to be unconstitutional when applied to someone only convicted of a misdemeanor. 

<p>In August 2011 a California Appeals Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/california-appeals-courts-strikes-down-law-requiring-dna-sample-from-arrestees.php">struck down the state law</a> [JURIST report] that required DNA samples be taken broadly from any adult arrested or charged with a felony. US Attorney General Eric Holder instructed federal prosecutors in November 2010 to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/holder-calls-for-increased-use-of-dna-evidence.php">use DNA evidence as much as possible</a> [JURIST report], reversing the Bush administration policy. The US District Court for the Eastern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-court-upholds-pre-trial-dna.php">upheld the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of mandatory DNA collection for all persons arrested or detained under federal authority in May 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In reversing the <a href="http://www.eenews.net/assets/2011/03/08/document_gw_04.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] made by the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York </a> [official website], the Second Circuit held that Chevron may not challenge the approximately $18 billion Ecuadorian judgment against it before enforcement of that judgment has actually been sought by the Ecuadorian plaintiffs. In its interpretation of the <a href="http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/fnact99/1920_69/ufmjra62.pdf">Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act</a> [text, PDF], the court concluded that judgment-debtors like Chevron can challenge a foreign judgment's validity under the Act only defensively and in response to an attempted enforcement. The court found that an effort of enforcement by the Ecuadorian plaintiffs had not yet been undertaken anywhere, and might never be undertaken in New York. While both Chevron and the Ecuadorian plaintiffs have yet to comment on the decision, Chevron has <a href="http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/ecuador/ecuador-lawsuit-fact-sheet.pdf?">long contended</a> [press release] that it has never conducted oil operations in Ecuador and that the allegations of environmental and social harm in the Amazon are therefore false. The Second Circuit's ruling was in line with an <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/federal-appeals-court-allows-damages-against-chevron-for-ecuador-oil-spill.php">earlier decision</a> issued in September.

<p>Just last week, Chevron <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/chevron-appeals-ecuador-courts-18-billion-fine.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a similar <a href="http://www.chevron.com/documents/pdf/ecuador/ChevronCassationAppeal.pdf">appeal</a> [text, PDF, in Spanish] with Ecuador's National Court of Justice to <a href="http://investor.chevron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=130102&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1651100&highlight=">reconsider the original decision</a> [press release] by an Ecuadorian judge requiring the oil company to pay roughly $18 billion in damages for its role in polluting the Amazon. Specifically, Chevron argued that the judge's decision violated Ecuador's constitution because the court failed to correct or punish the alleged fraud and corruption committed by plaintiffs' attorneys. Chevron also contended that because it inherited the case from Texaco, an oil company who was released from such liability by Ecuador in the 1990s, it too should be released from liability. The judgment was originally <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/ecuador-court-upholds-multi-billion-dollar-fine-against-chevron.php">upheld in January</a> [JURIST report] by a three-judge panel of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. Though the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">fine was initially set at $8.6 billion</a> [JURIST report], it was later more than doubled for Chevron's refusal to pay "moral reparations" to the Ecuadorian government, as required by the original ruling. The <a href="http://www.texacotoxico.org/eng/">Amazon Defense Coalition</a> [advocacy website], the Ecuadorian plaintiffs, have said that the first judgment was a reaffirmation of how Chevron's greed and criminal misconduct in polluting the region has led to death and disease. Damages were initially awarded last February by the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios which found that Texaco, acquired by Chevron in 2001, polluted large areas of the country's rain forest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The deaths come amid allegations of widespread torture and ill-treatment of detainees accused of being pro-Gaddafi loyalists and fighters during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libyan conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder] last year. AI conducted extensive interviews with detainees in and around Tripoli, Misrarah and Gheryan, many of whom showed visible marks indicative of torture, and whose accounts of maltreatment are consistent with their patterns of injury. AI reports that both official military and security entities as well as the multitude of unrecognized armed militias are responsible for the torture and subsequent deaths. Despite repeated requests by AI since May and its October report calling for an <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/sites/impact.amnesty.org/files/PUBLIC/mde190362011en.pdf">end to the torture of Libyan detainees</a> [report, PDF; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/new-libya-%E2%80%99stained%E2%80%99-detainee-abuse-2011-10-13">press release</a>], AI claims the new Libyan government has not taken adequate steps to investigate such human rights violations:<blockquote>So far there has been a complete failure on the part of those in power to take concrete steps to end torture and other ill-treatment of detainees and to hold accountable those responsible for such crimes. We don't underestimate the challenges faced by the Libyan transitional authorities in establishing control over the multitude of armed militias operating throughout the country, but we must see them taking decisive action on torture. In the interests of building a new Libya based on respect for human rights, this issue cannot be left at the bottom of the pile.</blockquote>AI concludes its most recent report by urging the Libyan government to abolish all non-official detention facilities and bring them under the control of legal authorities, to conduct investigations into the alleged torture practices and other maltreatment, to remove from detention facilities persons engaged in such activities and to provide detainees access to fair trials, lawyers and medical support.

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread in the aftermath of the Libyan conflict. On Thursday UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-human-rights-chief-addresses-alleged-torture-of-libyan-detainees.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over human rights violations in the country, urging that all detention facilities to be brought under the control of the Ministry of Justice and the General Prosecutor's Office. Last week a coalition of Middle Eastern human rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/middle-east-rights-groups-allege-human-rights-violations-in-libya.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the parties involved in the Libyan conflict to be in violation of human rights by using excessive force against protesters and cruel treatment of detainees. In September the Libyan NTC vowed to investigate allegations of human rights after AI [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the Libya conflict are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate the charges. In August Libyan Prime Minister Al Baghdad Ali Al-Mahmoudi requested that the UN create a "high-level commission" to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/libya-requests-un-investigation-into-nato-abuse.php">investigate human rights abuses allegedly committed by NATO</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The letter states that the privacy policy and Google's consolidated data sharing system raise questions about whether consumers can opt out of the new system, either globally or on a product-by-product basis. As Co-Chairman of the Congressional Bipartisan Privacy Caucus, Markey also expressed concerns as to whether Google's new policies violate the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] reached with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) [official website] last year:<blockquote>Google's new privacy policy should enable consumers to opt-out if they don't want their use of YouTube to morph into YouTrack. Consumers&#8212;not corporations&#8212;should have control over their own personal information, especially for children and teens. I plan to ask the Federal Trade Commission whether Google's planned changes to its privacy policy violate Google's recent settlement with the agency.</blockquote>Markey emphasized the degree to which consumers rely on Google and the importance of protecting the user's privacy. The FTC settlement resulted after privacy concerns arose over Google's controversial Buzz social networking tool rollout. According to its statement announcing the new privacy policy to members, Google's policy changes are directed across all of their services with the intention of creating a better user experience. 

<p>Google has had several legal battles in the last year, with consumer privacy rights often at issue. In August the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that the agency had <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-announces-500-million-google-settlement.php">reached a $500 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Google for permitting Canadian pharmaceutical companies to advertise to and target US consumers. In July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-allows-google-to-appeal-street-view-ruling.php">extended settlement negotiations</a> [JURIST report] over a 2005 copyright suit filed against Google over its <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> [corporate website] book scanning project. Also in July another federal judge ruled that Google could <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-allows-google-to-appeal-street-view-ruling.php">appeal a decision permitting a wiretapping lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over Google's <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Street View</a> [corporate website] service to proceed. Google was accused of violating user privacy by using WiFi networks to collect data for the service, a charge that came as a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">multistate investigation</a> that began in June of 2010. There have been international rulings on the Street View service as well. A <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/04/switzerland-court-rules-google-street-view-constitutes-breach-of-privacy.php">Swiss court ruled the service constituted a violation of privacy</a>, while a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">German court ruled it did not</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge heard the prosecutor's initial statements Wednesday and decided Thursday that the evidence was sufficient to go to trial. Montt is being charged for crimes committed throughout the country's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1215811.stm">36-year civil war</a> [BBC timeline], which officially ended in 1996. Montt was a general in the military who became dictator after a coup in 1982 but lost power a year later as a result of another coup. His charges are based on 72 incidents that caused 1,771 deaths under Montt's military command. Judicial officials decided Saturday that Montt will be <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/former-guatemala-dictator-to-give-testimony-in-genocide-trial.php">forced to testify</a> [JURIST report] at his trial. 

<p>The Guatemalan Civil War resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, 95 percent of which the military was responsible for according to a <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/spanish/toc.html">UN report</a> [text, in Spanish]. The majority of those who were killed were part of Guatemala's indigenous Mayan population. Two <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/former-guatemala-police-sentenced-to-40-years-with-evidence-from-rediscovered-archive.php">former police officers</a> [JURIST report] and four <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/guatemala-court-sentences-ex-soldiers-to-6000-years.php">former soldiers</a> [JURIST report] were convicted in 2010 and 2011 of charges relating to these crimes. Spain <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/guatemala-ex-police-chief-charged-in.php">attempted to charge Montt</a> [JURIST report] with war crimes in 2008, but failed because it lacked jurisdiction over the case. Montt had<a href="/paperchase/2006/07/ex-guatemala-dictator-says-spanish.php"> ignored warrants</a> [JURIST report] put out by Spain for his arrest in 2006 because he claimed he was not aware of any crimes committed by his men during the war.</p>]]></content:encoded>

BP will be required to indemnify Transocean against damages created by the pollution itself that are awarded throughout the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/OilSpill/OilSpill.htm">litigation</a> [materials] pending against it. BP will not be required to pay an punitive damages or civil fines as a result of these suits. The court did not rule as to whether BP or Transocean would be held strictly liable, negligent or grossly negligent for the equipment failure and subsequent oil spill that created the pollution. Transocean is the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that was contracted by BP, which subsequently caused the oil spill. This ruling is separate from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-rules-punitive-damages-available-against-BP-in-claims-over-oil-spill.php">ruling issued</a> [JURIST report] by Barbier in August, which permits punitive damages against BP, but that ruling pertained to claims brought against BP directly.

<p>Last summer Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-dismisses-bp-oil-spill-fraud-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] consolidated racketeering claims against BP in connection with the spill brought under the US <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/ch96.html">Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations</a> (RICO) [text]. In February of last year, Mississippi <a href="http://www.ago.state.ms.us/">Attorney General Jim Hood</a> [official website] asked the district court to order the <a href="http://www.gulfcoastclaimsfacility.com/index">Gulf Coast Claims Facility</a> (GCCF) [official website] to fulfill its legal obligations to aid victims of the spill and to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/mississippi-ag-seeks-to-remedy-deficiencies-of-bp-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">remedy inadequate claims mechanisms</a> [JURIST report]. The GCCF <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/independent-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund-begins-processing-claims.php">began processing claims</a> in August following the completion of <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/bp-doj-complete-negotiations-on-20-billion-oil-spill-victim-fund.php">negotiations</a> [JURIST reports] between BP and the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website].

The ban, <a href = "/paperchase/2011/09/netherlands-to-propose-burqa-ban.php">proposed in September</a> [JURIST report] and heavily supported by <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/">Geert Wilders</a>' [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=geert+wilders">news archive</a>] anti-Islam Freedom Party, is aimed at prohibiting burqas and other face coverings. <a href="http://www.parlement.com/9291000/biof/02920">Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Verhagen</a> [official profile, in Dutch] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/27/us-dutch-burqa-ban-idUSTRE80Q1OT20120127"> denied that the ban was meant for religious clothing</a> [Reuters report] and noted that the ban will also include motorcycle helmets and balaclavas when they are worn in inappropriate locations. The proposed legislation will not prohibit face coverings in mosques. Verhagen said the purpose behind the ban is to stop people from being able to commit crimes and remain undetected by concealing their identities and covering their faces. The Liberal-Christian Democrat coalition, the majority party in parliament, has agreed to propose a modified ban next week which would impose fines on people who violate the ban. The ban must still pass both houses of parliament in order to be enacted as law. 

<p>If enacted, the Netherlands will become the second  European country, after <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/dossiers/dissimulation_visage_espace_public.asp">France</a> [text, in French], to ban the burqa. A French court in September first <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/france-court-issues-first-fines-for-wearing-full-face-veils-in-public.php">enforced its own ban</a> [JURIST report] when it fined two Muslim women for violating the controversial French law. Although more than 90 women were previously cited by police, the fines are the first time a French court has enforced the law passed in April. The Netherlands is not the only country to follow France's lead by attempting to ban face coverings. In August, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/italy-lawmakers-approve-draft-burqa-ban-law.php">an Italian parliamentary commission approved a draft law</a> [JURIST report] that bans women from wearing full-face veils in public. In July, <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/belgium-burqa-ban-takes-effect.php">Belgium implemented a law banning women from wearing the burqa </a>[JURIST report] in public, with violators facing the possibility of fines or up to seven days in jail.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Manjoo emphasized that the current poor economic climate in Italy is no justification for violence against women and that the country has many resources available to women, such as psychological and economic assistance, that should not be disposed of. Manjoo said: <blockquote>Most manifestations of violence are underreported in the context of a family-oriented and patriarchal society where, domestic violence is not always perceived as a crime, there is economic dependency, and there are perceptions that the state response to such complaints will not be appropriate or helpful...[a] fragmented legal framework and inadequate investigation, punishment for perpetrators, and compensation for women victims of violence, also contributes to the silencing and invisibility surrounding this issue.</blockquote>Manjoon is expected to present the findings from her mission to the <a href = "http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] in June.

<p>Violence against women and gender equality also proves to be an issue for the rest of the world. In October, Manjoon appeared in front of the UN General Assembly to urge states to fulfill their obligations to prevent violence against women. Manjoo also released a report in June that said there is a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-us-faces-continued-violence-against-women.php"> continued prevalence of violence and discriminatory treatment of women in the US</a> [JURIST report], with a heightened impact on poor, minority and immigrant women. In March, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/un-rights-chief-urges-tunisia-egypt-to-protect-womens-rights.php">pressed</a> [JURIST report] Tunisia and Egypt to ensure that women's rights receive constitutional protection and to include women in the dialogue to shape the future of their countries. Last January, a US Military panel <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/military-commission-recommends-allowing-women-to-serve-in-direct-military-combat.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] that women should be allowed to serve on the front lines of combat. Also last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) called on the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/afghanistan-government-must-protect-women's-rights-during-reconciliation-efforts:-hrw.php">Afghan government to protect the rights of women</a> [JURIST report] during integration and reconciliation efforts conducted with the Taliban and other militants. Earlier in 2010, India's upper house of parliament, the Rajya Sabha, <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/india-upper-house-approves-quota-for.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] to ensure that one-third of seats in parliament are reserved for women.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mohamed was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">arrested for corruption</a> [JURIST report] in an unprecedented move by the military, following a ruling to release a government critic. Mohamed is also accused of <a href="http://minivannews.com/politics/resolving-judicial-crisis-a-huge-challenge-for-the-maldives-president-nasheed-31248">obstructing police investigations and having ties to organized crime</a> [<em>Minivan News</em> report]. The arrest has sparked street protests and prompted all the country's courts to boycott sessions. The Maldives <a href="http://foreign.gov.mv/new/">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] asked the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] for help resolving the issue [JURIST report] last week. The Maldives <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.mv/en/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] and the <a href="http://en.jsc.gov.mv/">Judicial Service Commission</a> [official website], which investigates judicial conduct, have called the arrest illegal and have demanded that Mohamed be released, but the army has yet to comply. UN officials have <a href = "http://ca.news.yahoo.com/un-says-maldives-must-release-judge-military-custody-145306924.html">not yet decided how to respond to the request</a> [AP report].

<p>The Maldives has faced ongoing political difficulties following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/maldives-president-signs-new.php">adoption of its constitution</a> [JURIST report] in late 2008. President Mohamed Nasheed defeated longtime political opponent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7658672.stm">Maumoon Abdul Gayoon</a> [BBC profile], who had jailed him numerous times during his 30-year rule. However, opposition legislators have blocked the ruling party's legislative agenda, leaving certain crucial provisions of the new constitutional system unestablished. This resulted in the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10452297">resignation of Nasheed's entire cabinet</a> [BBC report] in June 2010. The <a href="http://www.maldivesinfo.gov.mv/home/upload/downloads/Compilation.pdf">Maldives Constitution</a> [text, PDF] provides for multi-party elections, an independent judiciary and grants more authority to the legislature.

The SVA imposes a six month prison sentence on anyone who falsely claims to have received a military service medal or a one year sentence if the individual claimed to have received a <a href = "http://www.cmohs.org/">Congressional Medal of Honor</A> [official website]. The court stated that "knowingly false factual statements are not intrinsically protected under the First Amendment" as long as the law punishing false statements provides "breathing space" for protected speech: "knowingly false statements, in contrast even to incendiary ideas, are no part of the 'the common quest for truth and the vitality of society as a whole.'  Just because controversial ideas and opinions merit constitutional protection does not mean false facts deserve the same immunity." The court further stated that there was no danger of the law suppressing free speech, because it only criminalizes knowing misstatements of fact and does not criminalize political speech, criticism or parody.

<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] is set to hear arguments in February in <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">US v. Alvarez</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-210.htm">docket</a>] to decide whether the SVA is constitutional. The case is an appeal from a <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] that the SVA is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. The Ninth Circuit held that the speech prohibited under the Stolen Valor Act did not fit within the narrow categories of false speech held to be beyond the First Amendment's "protective sweep." The Stolen Valor Act was unanimously approved by the Senate and signed into law by former president George W. Bush in 2006. The act broadened provisions of previous US law and criminalizes the unauthorized wear, manufacture, sale or written or oral claim of any military decorations and medals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Many African nations still outlaw homosexuality. As of 2011, the <a href="http://ilga.org/">International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association</a> (ILGA) [advocacy website] <a href="http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2011.pdf">State-Sponsored Homophobia report</a> [text, PDF], 76 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, and five enforce the death penalty against homosexuals. Ban called for an end to this discrimination as part of Africa's further "investments in civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights." He said in his speech: <blockquote>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a promise to all people in all places at all times. Let me mention one form of discrimination that has been ignored or even sanctioned by many States for far too long-discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This has prompted some governments to treat people as second-class citizens, or even criminals. Confronting this discrimination is a challenge. But we must live up to the ideals of the Universal Declaration.</blockquote> Ban's statement follows statements by both US Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/12/178341.htm">Hillary Clinton</a> and British Prime Minister <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/oct/30/ban-homosexuality-lose-aid-cameron?newsfeed=true">David Cameron</a> [statements] speaking out against the current state of gay rights in Africa on behalf of their governments.  

<p>In June, the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the "Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution, the UN's first resolution calling for an end to sexuality discrimination. In March 2009, the US <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a UN <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/binary-data/ATTACHMENT/file/000/000/491-1.pdf">gay rights declaration</a> [text, PDF], which had previously been signed by 66 other nations. The declaration is a nonbinding measure that does not have the full force of a resolution. It urges on states to end criminalization and persecution of homosexuals. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-divided-over-gay.php">divided over the issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [JURIST report] with nearly half the countries calling for decriminalization, while the remaining countries opposed decriminalization.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This is the <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/ALDEC/TDWorld/Article_2012-01-30-EU-Norway-Terror-Trial/id-bae24b895d494a6a92748d0cfb233aec">first conviction under Norway's anti-terror laws</a> [AP report]. Both defendants, Mikael Davud and Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak, were found guilty in the Oslo district court, and sentenced to seven and three-and-a-half years, respectively. Although cleared of terror charges, David Jakobsen, will serve four months for helping the two defendants acquire explosives. The judge said that Davud orchestrated the attack with al Qaeda. Depicting the Prophet Muhammad is considered blasphemous by Muslims and has been a source of international controversy since 2005 when a Danish newspaper published caricatures of the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=danish+cartoon">Prophet Muhammad in a series of cartoons</a> [JURIST news archive].

<p>The caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad have sparked controversy across the globe. In May 2010 the <a href="http://www.pta.gov.pk/index.php?cur_t=vnormal">Pakistan Telecommunications Authority</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/pakistan-government-blocks-facebook-over-mohammed-drawing-competition.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Internet service providers to block social networking site <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> [website] in response to a competition created by a group of the website's members entitled "Draw Muhammad Day." Also in May, a Danish public prosecutor for the Utrecht District Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/dutch-prosecutor-to-appeal-holocaust-cartoon-ruling.php">filed an appeal</a> against an April <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/dutch-court-acquits-arab-group-of-hate.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] acquitting the Arab European League (AEL) of hate speech charges stemming from posting an inflammatory cartoon on their website insinuating that the Holocaust was fabricated. The court ruled that publishing the cartoon was not a criminal offense because it was intended to be a contribution to public debate regarding a perceived double standard in the distribution of the Danish Muhammad cartoons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/spip.php?rubrique17">Senegalese Constitution</a> [text, in French] had no term limits when Wade initially took office in 2000, but it was amended in 2001 to impose a two-term limit. The court found that Wade's "first term" under the 2001 constitution did not begin until he was reelected in 2007, concluding that he is eligible to run for another term. The court also rejected an appeal by popular musician Youssou Ndour, ruling that he will not be permitted to run for president because he <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/senegal-opposition-leads-cortege-police-station-15468098">failed to obtain the necessary signatures</a> [AP report]. Critics have accused the court of bias, since all five judges were appointed by Wade. Elections are scheduled for February 26. In response to this decision, the opposition has called on the country to protest Wade's candidacy, with demonstrations expected to take place later this week. 

<p>After the court's preliminary ruling on Friday, a group of youth protesters were confronted by the police, resulting in the death of one officer. With legal means of stopping Wade's candidacy now exhausted, the country may face instability in the coming weeks. The governments of the US and France have both warned of instability that could result from election-related violence.<br />

The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/usprisons0112webwcover_0.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], "Old Behind Bars: The Aging Prison Population in the United States," asserts that, depending on the state, the cost to effectively house and treat older prisoners is three to nine times higher than those for younger prisoners. The report found that 9.6 percent of prisoners are serving life sentences and an additional 11.2 percent have sentences longer than 20 years. Among other recommendations, HRW urged state and federal officials to:<blockquote><ul>
	<li>Review sentencing and release policies to determine which could be modified to reduce the growing population of older prisoners without risking public safety;</li>
	<li>Develop comprehensive plans for housing, medical care, and programs for the current and projected populations of older prisoners; and</li>
	<li>Modify prison rules that impose unnecessary hardship on older inmates. </li>
</ul></blockquote>The number of US state and federal prisoners age 55 or older is currently 124,400 which grew 282 percent between 1995 and 2010, while the total number of prisoners grew by only 42 percent.

<p>California's prison population has raised particular concerns. Earlier this month, a judge for the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] ruled that California prison officials have <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/court-california-prison-officials-have-failed-to-protect-disabled-inmates.php">failed to protect disabled parolees</a> [JURIST report] by not providing them wheelchairs and other mobility assistance devices. Last year, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-1233.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1233"">Brown v. Plata</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to uphold an order requiring California to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-order-to-reduce-california-prison-population.php">release up to 46,000 prisoners</a> [JURIST report] to remedy the state's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=california+prison">overcrowded prisons</a> [JURIST news archive]. California <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/california-submits-plan-to-reduce-prison-population-to-meet-court-order.php">submitted a plan</a> [JURIST report] to comply with the court's order, but the state's <a href="http://www.lao.ca.gov/laoapp/main.aspx">Legislative Analyst's Office</a> [official website] has concluded that California is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/california-unlikely-to-meet-meet-supreme-court-prison-reduction-deadline-report.php">unlikely to meet</a> [JURIST report] the Supreme Court's two-year deadline.

The ban was imposed upon Husain Haqqani after an anonymous memo that implied Pakistani politicians were collaborating with US politicians was sent to Washington, DC, in May, after <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">Osama bin Laden was killed by US forces</a> [JURIST report]. Haqqani resigned from his position as ambassador to the US after he came under suspicion for being the author of the memo. The Pakistan Supreme Court created a commission in order to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/pakistan-supreme-court-to-investigate-memo-scandal.php">investigate the origin of the memo</a> [JURIST report], but Haqqani has not been charged with any crime. Pakistani <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website] had also fallen under suspicion until recently when the man accusing Haqqani and Zadari of being involved with the memo, Mansoor Ijaz, refused to travel to Pakistan to testify in the case. Ijaz, who is also believed to have delivered the note to Washington, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16785304">offered to send his testimony by video</a> [BBC report]. Since his refusal to testify in person, the case is perceived to have weakened drastically. 

<p>Pakistan's Supreme Court has recently been in the news over issues concerning the ongoing struggle between the government and the courts. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/pakistan-high-court-gives-pm-two-weeks-to-prepare-defense-to-contempt-proceedings.php">honored a summons issued by the Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [JURIST report] by appearing earlier this month to answer contempt charges brought by the court. Gilani was ordered to appear to explain why he did not comply with court's order to reopen a corruption case against Zardari. The conflict between the prime minister and the court stems from an order which <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2009, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Referred to as the "trophy quality" case, Nastase and five other members of the <a href = "http://www.psd.ro/">Social Democratic Party of Romania</a> [party website, in Romanian] were convicted of raising money through taxation under a company called "trophy quality construction works" that then funneled USD $2.2 million to Nastase's failed presidential campaign. Some of Nastase's co-conspirators received sentences up to seven years, and all six received <a href = "http://www.tvr.ro/articol.php?id=119382&c=47">civil prohibitions</a> [TVR report, in Romanian]. Nastase was found not guilty of corruption charges in the "Aunt Tamara" case in December, which is awaiting an appeal taken by the National Anticorruption Department. He also awaits hearings on a third corruption case. In 2009, the <a href = "http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2009/01/romania-must-make-progress-in-fighting.php">urged Romania to lift a judicial immunity from Nastase</a> [JURIST report] and charge him with corruption.

<p>Allegations of widespread corruption in Romania have been ongoing since the nation broke away from the Soviet Union in 1989. Last week, the Constitutional Court of Romania ruled that a <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/romania-constitutional-court-rejects-controversial-election-law.php">law allowing local and parliamentary elections to be held at the same time</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional. After the ruling, Romanian President Traian Basescu defended his administration amid protests against the government's education, justice, criminal and economic policies. In March 2010, the EC released a report advising Romania to <a href = "/paperchase/2010/03/bulgaria-romania-legal-systems-need.php">do more to combat corruption and organized crime</a> [JURIST report] as well as conduct judicial reforms in order to enjoy their full rights as members of the European Union (EU).

The ICTY <a href = "http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/serb-demands-compensation-war-crimes-court-15470989#.Tyf2B9VGrcs">declined to comment</a> [AP report] on the filings Seselj made earlier this month, in which he charges that the ICTY refused to give him materials in Serbian; denied him communication with family members, doctors, and legal counsel; delayed his trial interminably; and refused him a right to his own, independent counsel. He has also requested special damages for his latest <A href = "/paperchase/2011/10/icty-sentences-seselj-to-18-months-for-contempt-of-court.php">contempt conviction</a> [JURIST report]. Seselj's doctors have also claimed that his health is <a href = "http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=01&dd=30&nav_id=78541">deteriorating</a> [B92 report], in part due to his treatment by the ICTY. In October, the ICTY ruled that Seselj received <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/icty-holds-seseljs-rights-to-fair-trial-not-violated.php">all guarantees of due process and fair proceedings available</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Seselj's war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/serb-nationalist-leader-on-trial-at.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 after he was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/ind/en/seslj3rdind071207e.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes and accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict. In July, Seselj alleged that he was being denied "speedy process," as he has been in custody since February 2003, and that the ICTY had denied him the right to defend himself by not fully funding his defense. Seselj made <a href = "http://www.icty.org/sid/10816">similar claims in 2009</a> [press release], which were also refuted by the court. His trial was briefly <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 because of concerns witnesses were being intimidated. The trial resumed in 2010 after the delay, and was again ordered to continue in 2011 after Seselj sought to have the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/cis/en/cis_seselj_en.pdf">charges dismissed</a> [case sheet, PDF]. The trial recently resumed earlier this month, after Seslj's third contempt conviction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Jean dismissed the charges reasoning that there are not sufficient legal grounds and that the statute of limitations has expired. Based on this ruling, Duvalier will go on trial before a special court facing charges of corruption and misappropriation of public funds with at most 5-year imprisonment. Jean's ruling has not been made public. Numerous human rights groups, including <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/haiti-dropping-jean-claude-duvalier-case-disgrace-2012-01-31">press report</a>] and the UN have <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11791&LangID=E">criticized</a> [press release] this ruling stating that there are sufficient evidence for the charges against human rights violations and that under international law statute of limitations is not applicable:<blockquote>It is clear under international law that there is no statute of limitations for such crimes, and the UN Human Rights office has provided technical assistance and legal advice stressing this point. We are extremely disappointed at reports that Mr. Duvalier may not be charged with any human rights crimes, despite numerous complaints by victims to the prosecutor. Impunity for such serious crimes cannot be allowed to prevail and we urge the relevant authorities to ensure that justice is, belatedly, delivered to the many victims of human rights abuses committed under the government of Mr. Duvalier. There can be no true reconciliation and forgiveness without justice.</blockquote>
The charges were initiated last January by more than 20 victims after Duvalier returned from his exile in France. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] and other organizations expressed their plan to appeal the judgment.

<p>Haiti has been urged numerous times by different organizations to improve its human rights records and to try Duvalier for his crimes against humanity. In September, AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-urges-haiti-authorities-to-prosecute-former-haiti-president.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Haitin government to prosecute Duvalier after its release of a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR36/007/2011/en/c1eaace5-e98b-4d9c-b0b6-48dcbd7b75ae/amr360072011en.pdf">report</a> [report, PDF] documenting crimes committed during the former president's reign. The findings were the result of an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-to-probe-alleged-rights-violations-by-former-dictator-report.php">eight-month investigation</a> [JURIST report]. In July, the UN Deputy <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/aboutUs/Pages/DeputyhighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-Wha Kang</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-urges-haiti-to-improve-rights-try-duvalier.php">pressed Haiti</a> [JURIST report] to establish a system of human rights and equality, especially by speeding up the case against Duvalier. He was <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-ex-presdient-accused-of-crimes-against-humanity.php">accused of crimes against humanity</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-files-theft-and-corruption-charges-against-former-president-duvalier.php">corruption</a> [JURIST reports] in January of last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The opposition groups, which include members in both the <a href="http://www.senat.fr/">Senate</a> and the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr">National Assembly</a>, gathered the necessary signatures to require the <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/">Constitutional council of the French Republic</a> [official websites, in French] to determine if the law is constitutional. While France has already recognized the 1915 killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, the new law would punish anyone who denies that the killings constituted a genocide with <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5glrhZbgLK1SdbAYeRjtu8Nkukzhw?docId=CNG.6b1385dde28d74d4c63865663f0d0c3c.2f1">up to a year in jail and a USD $59,000 fine</a> [AFP report]. While French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French] has insisted that the law did not specifically target Turkey, Turkish officials were furious, warning that if the law takes effect, Turkey will <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10056925">impose unspecified sanctions on France</a> [AP report]. Turkish <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6900616.stm">Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [BBC profile] remained hopeful, however, that the constitutional council would <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/01/201213113404166611.html">strike down the genocide denial law</a> [Al Jazeera report].

<p>The Armenian genocide is also a contentious issue in US law and politics. In November the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] decided to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ninth-circuit-to-rehear-armenia-genocide-lawsuit.php">revisit a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether a California law declaring Armenian genocide in Turkey conflicts with US foreign policy. In August 2010 a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-over-armenian-genocide-curriculum.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the exclusion of materials questioning the Armenian genocide from a school curriculum. In March 2010 the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">announced its opposition to a resolution</a> [JURIST report] labeling the World War I-era killings as genocide. The announcement came after the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 23-22. Erdogan condemned the resolution, and the Turkish government recalled its ambassador to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW's plea comes in response to the release of a YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5kBqutAcio&feature=youtu.be&oref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrw.org%2Fnews%2F2012%2F01%2F30%2Findia-prosecute-security-forces-torture&has_verified=1&skipcontrinter=1">video</a> [warning: graphic content] capturing BSF soldiers stripping, tying up and beating a Bangladeshi national caught smuggling cattle from Bangladesh into India. Although Indian law requires the BSF to hand over such lawbreakers to the police, HRW contends that the soldiers "illegally detained and tortured" the man, then left him to return to Bangladesh. Said <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/meenakshi-ganguly">Meenakshi Ganguly</a> [HRW profile], South Asian director at HRW:<blockquote>These horrific images of torture on video show what rights groups have long documented: that India's Border Security Force is out of control. The Indian government is well aware of killings and torture at the border, but has never prosecuted the troops responsible. This video provides a clear test case of whether the security forces are above the law in India.</blockquote>The BSF has so far suspended eight soldiers and ordered an inquiry into the situation. However, despite the video evidence, the Indian government has yet to file criminal charges against any of the soldiers. 

<p>In December 2010, HRW and the <a href="http://www.masum.org.in/">Banglar Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha </a> (MASUM) [advocacy website], a Kolkatta-based NGO that posted the video, and <a href="http://www.odhikar.org/">Odhikar</a> [advocacy website], an NGO based in Dhaka, published <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/bangladesh1210Web.pdf">Trigger Happy: Excessive Use of Force by Indian Troops at the Bangladesh Border</a> [text, PDF], a report accusing BSF soldiers of torturing both Indians and Bangladeshis. Although the Indian government soon thereafter ordered an end to the use of lethal force by BSF soldiers except in self-defense, allegations of killings and torture have continued. In April 2010, the Cabinet of India <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/india-cabinet-approves-anti-torture.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.achrweb.org/reports/india/India-Anti-Torture-Bill-2009.pdf">Prevention of Torture Bill</a> [text, PDF] after lengthy legislative delays in an effort to move the country closer to international human rights standards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Garzon has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">charged with abusing power</a> by <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordering the exhumation</a> [JURIST reports] of 19 mass graves in Spain in order to assemble a definitive national registry of Civil War victims, despite a 1977 law that provides amnesty for Franco-era crimes. While on the stand, Garzon <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/31/world/europe/spain-judge-trial/?hpt=wo_c2">refused to answer questions</a> [CNN report] posed to him by the prosecution but did answer questions from his defense lawyer. Garzon denied that his investigation was politically motivated, stating that he was seeking justice for the victims of the alleged crimes. Garzon also rejected the idea that the 1977 amnesty law covers widespread human rights abuses. He indicated that the 1977 law was only meant to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9051980/Spanish-judge-Baltasar-Garzon-defends-probe-of-possible-war-crimes.html">cover crimes of a political nature</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report], not crimes against humanity. Garzon's testimony was consistent with his previous <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/spain-judge-garzon-defends-2008-franco.php">statements defending</a> [JURIST report] the validity of the investigation by insisting that he acted within the bounds of the law and appropriately applied the law at all times. If he is convicted, Garzon could face a suspension of up to 20 years. 

<p>Last March, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/spain-judge-garzon-petitions-europe-rights-court-over-franco-probe.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging the 2010 abuse of power charges, for which he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-judicial-panel-suspends-judge-garzon-over-franco-probe.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report]. His petition follows the September 2010 decision of the Criminal Chamber of the Spanish Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/spain-high-court-confirms-decision-against-judge-garzon-in-franco-probe.php">unanimously confirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court order that Garzon abused his power and must face trial. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. He is also facing two other trials, including one trial that began earlier in January involving <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-high-court-begins-first-trial-of-judge-garzon.php">charges that he ordered the placement of wiretaps in jailhouses</a> [JURIST report] to record conversations between inmates and their lawyers. The third trial, which has not started, involves bribery charges over money Garzon received for seminars conducted in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In its response Google replied to 11 specific questions posed in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">letter sent last week</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/p/larry_page/index.html">CEO Larry Page</a> [NYT backgrounder] by US <a href="http://markey.house.gov/">Representative Edward Markey</a> (D-MA) [official website] and seven other lawmakers. Google's response included a confirmation that no new types of data are going to be collected with the advent of the new privacy policy, a list of those services that can be used without signing into a Google Account, the reasons for data sharing between Google products, and a description of the process for data deletion when a user closes an account, along with background information on the motivation for the policy changes. Google maintains its primary reasons for the new privacy policy are to simplify the policy to make it more understandable for consumers, and to improve the user experience across all Google products. In its letter Google described its consolidation of approximately 70 different privacy policies from its various products into a single policy, noting, "Regulators globally have been calling for shorter, simpler privacy policies." Furthermore the company stated that it will continue to comply with the obligations set out in its <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">settlement with the FTC</a> [JURIST report], including the submission of regular independent reviews of its privacy policies, and did not anticipate violating any terms of the settlement. The new privacy policy is set to go into effect March 1.

<p>Google has had several legal battles in the last year, with consumer privacy rights often at issue. In August the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that the agency had <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-announces-500-million-google-settlement.php">reached a $500 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Google for permitting Canadian pharmaceutical companies to advertise to and target US consumers. In July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-allows-google-to-appeal-street-view-ruling.php">extended settlement negotiations</a> [JURIST report] over a 2005 copyright suit filed against Google over its <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> [corporate website] book scanning project. Also in July another federal judge ruled that Google could <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-allows-google-to-appeal-street-view-ruling.php">appeal a decision permitting a wiretapping lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over Google's <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Street View</a> [corporate website] service to proceed. Google was accused of violating user privacy by using WiFi networks to collect data for the service, a charge that came as a result of a <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">multistate investigation</a> that began in June of 2010. There have been international rulings on the Street View service as well. A <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2011/04/switzerland-court-rules-google-street-view-constitutes-breach-of-privacy.php">Swiss court ruled the service constituted a violation of privacy</a>, while a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/germany-court-rules-google-street-view-legal.php">German court ruled it did not</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In December 2010, nine men who met through radical Islamist groups were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/nine-men-charged-in-uk-for-terror-plot-against-us-embassy.php">charged and taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] in the UK for conspiring to bomb the <a target="_blank" href="http://london.usembassy.gov/">US Embassy</a> [official website] and the LSE. When the plot was uncovered, all nine men were picked up in raids. They denied all charges originally, but <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_BRITAIN_TERROR_TRIAL?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">four of the men pleaded guilty</a> [AP report] on the eve of their trials. Mohammed Chowdhury, Shah Rahman, Gurukanth Desai and Abdul Miah admitted that they planned to place an improvised explosive device in the LSE toilets. The other five men pleaded guilty to lesser charges. The prosecutor admitted that the men did not plan to kill anyone, but intended to spread mass terror and economic harm. However, he did contend that their actions created risks to the lives of many. The men were not members of al Qaeda, but were inspired by the organization and the sermons of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Awlaki">news archive</a>], the US born cleric who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">killed last year</a> [JURIST report]. The men talked and planned openly, not knowing that they were under surveillance. Sentencing will take place next week, but the judge has already informed Chowdhury and Rahman that they will receive sentences of 18 1/2 and 17 years in prison respectively.

<p>Great Britain has been the target of terror plots in the years since the <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/breaking-news-many-injured-in-london.php">2005 London transit bombings</a> [JURIST report; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/london.php">news archive</a>], but has been proactive about prompt apprehension of terror suspects. The 2005 attacks killed 52 people and injured 700 others. In October 2010, a UK court began <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uk-court-begins-inquests-over-2005-london-transit-bombings.php">inquests into the bombings</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether more lives could have been saved with a quicker response. In July 2010, the UK Woolwich Crown Court sentenced three British Muslims to a minimum of 20 years in prison after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/uk-court-sentences-3-in-2006-airliner-bomb-plot-to-life-in-prison.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] and sentenced to life in prison under the Terrorism Act of 2006 for involvement with a 2006 plot to blow up numerous transatlantic flights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After reviewing the case, the court found there were no special circumstances warranting review. The court could also have decided to hear the case if it determined a review by Sweden's highest court would be important for the country's law enforcement, but it declined to hear the appeal on those ground as well. The court's decision not to hear the appeal immediately prompted response from critics. The founder of the <a href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/">Pirate Party</a> [party website in Swedish], a political party in Sweden, <a href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/h%C3%B6gsta-domstolen-avsl%C3%A5r-pr%C3%B6vning-av-pirate-bay-m%C3%A5let">expressed concern</a> [press release in Swedish] over the court's decision not to hear the case calling it a "fundamentally important" case that, if decided by the high court, would help to sort out future cases. The Pirate Bay also issued a defiant <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/blog/204">response on its website</a> [press release] stating that "what enrages us to our inner core is that the system, the empire, the governments, are still allowed to try to boss you and us around with one law crazier than the other." It is unclear what will happen to the website in light of this decision.

<p>In November of last year the Swedish <a href="http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2319.aspx">Svea Appeals Court</a> [materials] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/swedish-appeals-court-upholds-pirate-bay-convictions.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the convictions of the Pirate Bay founders. In April 2009 the website operators were sentenced to one year in prison for <a href="http://sverigesradio.se/Diverse/AppData/Isidor/files/83/6276.pdf">abetting copyright infringement</a> [judgment, PDF, in Swedish; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-court-issues-guilty-verdict-in.php">report</a>]. In June 2009 several <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/hollywood-companies-file-suit-against.php">Hollywood production companies filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in Sweden against the operators of The Pirate Bay, seeking an injunction. The US companies, including Disney, Universal and Columbia Pictures, filed a writ to sue in the Stockholm District Court, requesting that the court order the owners to cease and desist operations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Taylor's lawyers request this report <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hfXwCqjnpog3ph7XyYDJDI_H17tw?docId=1be0b6c1e91a4f7bb055a5b1e77695a8">be admitted as evidence in the case</a> [AP report], claiming that the report may show that Taylor was not instrumental in directing mercenaries who committed war crimes in Sierra Leone. The report dedicates about 20 pages to Liberian mercenaries, and Taylor's lawyers contend that the panel's research demonstrates that the mercenaries were acting of their own accord. Taylor's <a href="http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=lrn0bAAMvYM%3d&tabid=107">charges</a> [indictment, PDF] include 11 counts of crimes against humanity, violations of the Geneva Conventions and other violations of international humanitarian law.  His trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/war-crimes-trial-of-ex-liberia-president-taylor-concludes.php">officially concluded</a> [JURIST report] in March 2011, but no verdict has been returned. The court did not immediately respond to his lawyers' request. 

<p>The SCSL heard closing arguments in March 2011. Closing arguments were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/closing-arguments-begin-in-trial-of-former-liberian-president-taylor-enters.php">originally set to begin a month earlier</a>, but were <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/pending-appeal-delays-closing-trial-of-former-liberian-president.php">postponed</a> pending an appeals chamber <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-to-hear-defense-closing-arguments.php">decision to accept the defense's final written brief</a> [JURIST reports]. The trial chamber originally disregarded the brief because it was 20 days late. Taylor has <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-taylor-takes-stand.php">denied the charges</a> [JURIST report] against him, which include murder, rape, sexual slavery and acts of terrorism stemming from from a "campaign to terrorize the civilian population" of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sierra+Leone">Sierra Leone</a> [JURIST news archive]. Taylor's defense lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/liberia-ex-president-begins-defense.php">opened their case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009 and have claimed that he could not have commanded rebel forces in Sierra Leone while acting as the president of Liberia. His trial continued after the court <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/sierra-leone-war-crimes-court-denies.php">denied his motion for acquittal</a> [JURIST report] in May 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/contempt_rasic/cis/en/cis_rasic_en.pdf&sa=U&ei=jnkpT73mCITFtgfK_4D3BA&ved=0CAYQFjAB&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNHXGkHSF2DyBYLPE5MliSBpUJYAyw">original indictment</a> [PDF], the prosecutor of the tribunal charged Rasic with contempt for procuring false witness statements from three Bosnian citizens. In exchange for signing the pre-written witness statements, Rasic gave the three citizens money. The prosecutor concluded that by procuring these false witness statements and committing bribery, Rasic "knowingly and willfully interfered with the tribunal's administration of justice." The prosecutor filed the indictment against Rasic in July 2010. In her initial appearance before the tribunal in September 2010, Rasic pleaded not guilty to all five contempt charges. No date has been set for her judgment hearing.

<p>The ICTY has been the subject of copious international attention recently. On Monday, former Serb nationalist politician and war crimes suspect <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/">Vojislav Seselj</a> [official website, in Serbian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=seselj">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icty-war-crimes-suspect-demands-compensation-for-trial-delays.php">sued the ICTY</a> [JURIST report] for $2.6 million in damages for allegedly unreasonable delays in his trial. In December, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icty-convicts-former-yugoslav-intelligence-officer-of-contempt-for-failure-to-testify.php">convicted former Yugoslav intelligence officer Dragomir Pecanac of contempt</a> [JURIST report] for failing to testify before the tribunal. Also in December, former Serbian general and alleged war criminal <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/cis/en/cis_mladic_en.pdf">Ratko Mladic</a> [ICTY backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>], testifying before the ICTY, <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/mladic-pleads-not-guilty-trial-set-for-march.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to murdering over 30 Muslim prisoners. Earlier in December, the ICTY, along with the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-war-crimes-tribunals-report-progress-to-security-council.php">reported progress</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website]. During this meeting, the ICTY reported that its last two wanted fugitives had been arrested, meaning none of the <a href="http://www.icty.org/sections/TheCases/KeyFigures">161 persons wanted by the tribunal</a> [materials] remains at large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The lawsuit comes in response to the three American citizens that have been killed by drones in the past four months. In particular, the ACLU seeks specific evidence that provided the basis for the strikes in Yemen during the fall of 2011, which killed three Americans. This lawsuit overlaps and expands on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/new-york-times-sues-doj-alleging-violations-of-freedom-of-information-act.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> (NYT) [media website] requesting the legal memos that provide the basis for the US's targeted killing program. The complaint states:<blockquote>Although U.S. government officials, including the President and the Secretary of Defense, have made statements on the record confirming the existence of the targeted killing program, the government has not disclosed the process by which it adds names to so-called "killed lists;" the standards under which it determines which Americans may be put to death; or the evidentiary bases on which it concludes that those standards satisfied in any particular case.</blockquote>The Obama administration maintains that the killing of American terrorism suspects is a state secret.

<p>Targeted killings have been a <a href="/hotline/2011/11/mark-kersten-targeted-killing.php">controversial topic</a> [JURIST comment] during the current war on terror. In December, the <em>New York Times</em> filed a lawsuit against the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] alleging the government violated the FOIA in refusing to release legal memoranda related to targeted killings of terror suspects. The suit relates to the death of the US-born radical Muslim cleric <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Awlaki">news archive</a>] who was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">killed in a US drone strike</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen in September 2011. An Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-legal-memo-justifies-killing-of-al-Awlaki.php">legal memorandum</a> [JURIST report] from 2010 found that the killing of US citizen and senior <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] leader al-Awlaki would only be legal if it were not feasible to take al-Awlaki alive. The memo followed months of legal debate regarding the decision to kill a US citizen without first having a trial. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Washington currently grants <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">expanded domestic partnership rights</a> [JURIST report] rather than full marriage or civil union rights to same-sex couples. Several amendments affording protection of religious objection to same-sex marriage were added to the bill in debate. Others, that would have triggered a referendum on the issue, and would have allowed marriage-related business owners' ability to discriminate against same-sex couples, were rejected.
<p>
<center><iframe src="http://www.tvw.org/scripts/iframe_video.php?eventID=2012020049&start=&stop=" width="550" height="320"></iframe></center>

<p>The <a href = "http://www.leg.wa.gov/house/Pages/default.aspx">House of Representatives</a> [official website] is expected to pass the bill soon. <A href = "http://www.governor.wa.gov">Governor Christine Gregoire</a> [official website], a major supporter of the movement, has <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/washington-governor-to-introduce-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">sworn to sign the bill</a> [JURIST report] on several occasions, and on Wednesday released a <a href = "http://www.governor.wa.gov/news/news-view.asp?pressRelease=1849&newsType=1">statement</a> [text] commending the Senate.</p>

<p>Washington is poised to become the eighth jurisdiction in the US to legalize <A href = "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J-3yWRH-yi4/TsFNuYBY57I/AAAAAAABLrA/GcaLWUm5_fM/s1600/MarriageMap.jpg">same-sex marriage</a> [US map]. In a similar situation, New Jersey is considering legalizing same-sex marriage soon, although it currently has a civil union system in place. In November, a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the New Jersey State Constitution. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].

Tracy Cooper-Harris, who served in the <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> [official website] for over a decade, argues that the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text] is unconstitutional because it discriminates against legally married individuals. Cooper-Harris and her wife were legally married in California in 2008. Cooper-Harris has been receiving benefits from the VA since she was honorably discharged in 2003. She suffers from multiple sclerosis and post traumatic stress related to her time in service. The VA denied the veteran the level of benefits received by married persons under DOMA, and instead pay her benefits at the lesser single person rate. Additionally, Cooper-Harris' spouse will not be entitled to receive compensation in the event of Cooper-Harris' death as she would have been entitled to if their marriage was recognized under the federal law. 

<p>A <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-veteran-appeals-benefits-claim-denied-under-doma.php">similar suit was filed</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/">Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims</a> [official website] in October of last year by a disabled Navy veteran contesting the VA's refusal to allow her same-sex partner to collect a portion of her disability benefits. The veteran, Carmen Cardona, filed the suit after her claim for veterans' spousal benefits was denied under DOMA on the basis that she was in a same-sex marriage. The outcome of these cases is uncertain after the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced in February of last year that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA in court cases challenging the provision, there is no obligation on federal agencies not to enforce the law. US <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] told gay rights activists in October of last year that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">continue to fight for the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA, reinforcing that the DOJ is not defending its constitutionality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gilani has failed to comply with the court's order to reopen a corruption case against <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [official website], but Gilani maintains he did not comply with the court's order because Zardari is <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2012/02/20122283346509122.html">immune from prosecution</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The conflict between the prime minister and the court stems from an order which <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2009, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999. Gilani and his lawyers are considering appealing the indictment, which is permitted in Pakistan even before a conviction has been handed down. If convicted, Gilani could face six months in prison and removal from public office.

<p>These proceedings reflect an ongoing struggle between the government and the courts in Pakistan. In December, the Supreme Court formed a judicial committee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/pakistan-supreme-court-to-investigate-memo-scandal.php">investigate a secret memo</a> [JURIST report] sent from an unknown Pakistani source to US Admiral Mike Mullen in May asking for help in preventing a suspected army coup. Zardari and former Pakistan ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani have been accused of writing or having knowledge of the memo, and both have denied these allegations. In October 2011, the Supreme Court issued a judgment <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/pakistan-top-judge-orders-political-parties-to-cut-ties-with-%20criminal-gangs.php">urging political parties to stop financing criminal groups</a> [JURIST report] responsible for increased violence in the city of Karachi. The decision stated that militant groups have gained strength because of support from local political groups and order the Pakistani government to help address the corruption. The court struck down the NRO in 2009, which was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] by former Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4797762.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile; JURIST<a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf"> news archive</a>] in 2007. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Reports of shooting at protestors have caused the death of at least one police officer and four other people this week. The reports were "disturbing" to Pillay given Senegal's tradition of respect for freedom of association, assembly and expression. She said, "[w]ith the presidential campaign beginning this weekend, I cannot stress enough the importance of full respect for the fundamental human rights. These rights are particularly crucial during an election period." Pillay stressed following standards of maintaining public order laid out in international law. She called for an investigation into the killings and the alleged use of disproportionate force by both police officers and protestors. Pillay also called on the presidential candidates to discourage the violence.

<p>Senegal's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/senegal-high-court-allows-president-to-run-for-third-term.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] Monday that <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/spip.php?article7">President Abdoulaye Wade</a> [official profile, in French] can run for a third term, rejecting an appeal by the opposition. The <a href="http://www.gouv.sn/spip.php?rubrique17">Senegalese Constitution</a> [text, in French] had no term limits when Wade initially took office in 2000, but it was amended in 2001 to impose a two-term limit. After the court's preliminary ruling on Friday, a group of youth protesters were confronted by the police. With legal means of stopping Wade's candidacy now exhausted the country may face instability in the coming weeks. The governments of the US and France have both warned of instability that could result from election-related violence. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Lawyers for alleged al Qaeda senior leader <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> filed the motions seeking to question Yemeni <a href="http://www.presidentsaleh.gov.ye/index.php">President Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> while he is in the US receiving medical treatment. They argue that because Saleh will be in the jurisdiction of the US he can lawfully be subpoenaed. Nashiri's lawyers argue that Saleh, who was president of Yemen when the USS Cole attack occurred, may have information pertinent to their case. They also filed a motion for expedited ruling on the issue so the court should announce a decision on the motion soon. 

<p>In November Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/alleged-uss-cole-bomber-makes-first-court-appearance.php">made his first court appearance</a>, his first public appearance since he was captured in Dubai in 2002.

In May of last year, lawyers for Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-uss-cole-bomber-sues-poland-over-secret-cia-prison-site.php">filed suit against Poland</a> over his supposed torture in a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=CIA+secret+prisons">secret CIA prison</a> in the country. In 2007, Nashiri declared that his confession to orchestrating the USS Cole bombing was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/guantanamo-detainee-says-torture.php">elicited under torture</a>. Nashiri, along with fellow militant <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/jamel-ahmed-mohammed-ali-al-badawi">Jamal al-Badawi</a>, was <a href="/paperchase/2005/02/yemeni-court-upholds-death-sentence-in.php">sentenced to death</a> by a Yemeni court in 2004 for his role in the attack on the Cole.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontstl.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>Four accused assassins of former Lebanese prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4264359.stm">Rafik Hariri</a> will be <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/media/press-releases/01-02-2012-in-absentia-proceedings">tried <em>in absentia</em></a>, a UN tribunal said Wednesday. The UN <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/">Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a> (STL) said Wednesday that after considering the efforts taken by the prosecution and the authorities to apprehend the suspects, they would move forward with the trial. The four alleged <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> members are accused of involvement in a February 2005 truck bomb that killed Hariri and 22 other people. The STL determined that the prosecution took "all reasonable steps" to apprehend and inform the accused, and that the proceedings were a "last resort":<blockquote>The Trial Chamber examined ... the steps taken by the Lebanese authorities to apprehend the accused and inform them about the proceedings. These efforts included multiple attempts by the Lebanese authorities to find the accused at their last known residences, places of employment, family homes and other locations. The Trial Chamber also took into consideration the fact that the indictment and the identities of the accused received massive publicity in Lebanon...While the STL is the only international Tribunal that can prosecute accused in their absence, it is a measure of last resort to ensure that the pursuit of justice is not paralysed by those who choose to abscond.</blockquote>No date has been set for the trial, which will <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/media/press-releases/01-02-2012-trial-chamber-decision-in-absentia-the-upcoming-steps">not begin for at least 4 months</a>. STL <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/en/about-the-stl/key-characters/head-of-defence-office-francois-roux">Head of Defence Francois Roux</a> will be assigned to appoint counsel to the accused. If the accused choose to appear or are apprehended at anytime during the trial, they have a right to appoint their own counsel and be retried. If the accused appear after a verdict and sentence have been delivered, they may accept both, request a new sentence, or request a new trial. 

<p>Last August the <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-to-investigate-bomb-attacks-related-to-hariri-case.php">STL announced that it would investigate three additional bomb attacks</a> that may be connected to the February 2005 attack that killed Hariri. Earlier that month, the STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-unseals-indictment-in-hariri-case.php">unsealed the indictment</a> against the four individuals accused of the assassination. Also in August the STL president made a public plea for the men to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-urges-suspects-to-turn-themselves-in.php">turn themselves in</a>. Judge Antonio Cassese guaranteed a fair trial and adequate representation and pressed Lebanese citizens to allow the STL to hold the assassins accountable. In February 2011 the appeals chamber of the STL issued a unanimous <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/News/Summary%20of%20Decision_16%20February%20%28EN%29.pdf">ruling</a> on several procedural issues, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-defines-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">including the definition of terrorism</a>, in judicial proceedings. The STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/lebanon-tribunal-meets-to-define-terrorism-for-hariri-case.php">began debate on the issue</a> to determine which laws to apply in the case against the alleged Hariri assasins. Using the <a href="http://www.stl-tsl.org/x/file/TheRegistry/Library/BackgroundDocuments/ApplicableLaw/CHA_09_0048_6July2010_EN.pdf">Article 314 of the Lebanese Criminal Code</a>, the court held that a conviction on the charge of terrorism requires proof of an act intended to spread terror and use of a means "liable to create a public danger," that the only requirement is that "the means used to carry out the terrorist attack be liable to create a common danger" and that the trial judges should be given latitude in determining whether the requirement was met after having considered the facts presented in the case. The STL was established in 2005 at the request of the Lebanese government to try those alleged to be connected to the bombing in which Hariri was killed by explosions detonated near his motorcade in Beirut.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Schwarzenegger</a> [opinion], California's 2010 trial which declared <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>], the state's same-sex marriage ban, to be unconstitutional. In reversing the opinion of the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], the circuit court concluded that recordings from the landmark case <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/ruling-due-release-gay-marriage-trial-videos-15495348#.TyrhKvnZWSo">could not be released</a> [AP report] without undermining the integrity of the judicial system. It found that Chief Judge Walker, the district judge at trial, "made no commitment to the parties to limit the use of the recording to helping him with his own deliberations, and, more important, not to allow the recording to be used for 'public broadcasting or televising.'" As such, held the Ninth Circuit, the district court abused its discretion in unsealing the videos because it lacked support in inferences that could be drawn from the record. Said the court:<blockquote>The integrity of our judicial system depends in no small part on the ability of litigants and members of the public to rely on a judge's word. The record compels the finding that the trial judge's representations to the parties were solemn commitments. ... We conclude ... that the integrity of the judicial process is a compelling interest that in these circumstances would be harmed by the nullification of the trial judge's express assurances, and that there are no alternatives to maintaining the recording under seal that would protect the compelling interest at issue.</blockquote>Walker, who has since retired and revealed his relationship with another man, originally wanted the trial broadcasted. He was subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-blocks-youtube-broadcast.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] from doing so by the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], which cited that witnesses sponsoring the ban could be subject to harassment if the trial footage became viral. The Ninth Circuit made clear that it would not yet decide the constitutionality of Proposition 8.

<p>The Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-proposition-8-issues.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in December on whether the video recordings should be released to the public. There, Proposition 8 supporters, much like their original argument against broadcasting the trial, <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/11/29/11-17255_reply_brief_defendant.pdf">argued</a> [text, PDF] against the release because it could lead to harassment of their witnesses. The supporters also claimed that the First Amendment right of access has no application in this instance. Proposition 8 opponents <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2011/11/16/11-17255_brief_plaintiff.pdf">argued</a> [text, PDF] that there is no reason not to make the recordings public, and that there is a public interest to do so. Proposition 8 was <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by California voters in November 2008 and remains legally controversial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new requirements include the audio provision of fetal heartbeat and a determination of the gestational age of the fetus. Additionally, a written record must be created to indicate that the woman was offered the ultrasound and whether she choose to view it. That record, along with a copy of the ultrasound picture will be included in the woman's medical file. Some commentators have recently <a href="/forum/2012/01/mary-ziegler-informed-consent.php">noted</a> [JURIST op-ed] that similar legislation, and court opinions supporting those laws, have signaled a shift in the abortion debate from a "right to life" to a "right to know" doctrine.

<p>Virignia is not the first state to pass such legislation, and similar rules have drawn various results when challenged in the court system. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-sonogram-law.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas law</a> [JURIST report] that requires women to have a sonogram before undergoing an abortion, allowing the law to be enforced. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March of 2010, The <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The allegations stem from HRW's documentation of cases in which children were reportedly detained, tortured and shot in their homes. There are prior findings that the Syrian government has been involved in torturing and killing civilian protesters. HRW discovered that among those tortured protesters were children as young as 13. Interviews with juvenile victims and adult protesters who saw those children in detention centers confirmed HRW's findings. Children were reportedly arrested in schools, beaten and confined in solitary cells for several weeks without adequate food supply and  medical attention:<blockquote>Children have not been spared the horror of Syria's crackdown. Syrian security forces have killed, arrested, and tortured children in their homes, their schools, or on the streets. In many cases, security forces have targeted children just as they have targeted adults.</blockquote>In addition to the violence against children, the Syrian government has confiscated schools and hospitals for the use of military purposes such as detention centers or sniper posts. HRW urged the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to take action and to press the Syrian government to end the inhumane violence against children.

<p>The Syrian government has been under severe criticism for its continued violence and its failure to stop it. Last month, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] Syria's president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder] end the violence against its own people and strive for establishing democracy. In the same month, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/syria-releases-more-than-500-prisoners-as-part-of-arab-league-agreement.php">Syria released</a> [JURIST report] more than 500 prisoners who were accused of having participated in terrorist activities, according to its agreement with the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/portal/las_ar/home_page/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gXy8CgMJMgYwODEH8zA08jD5cgP0M_YwsvY6B8JB55QwK6gxOL9MNBduI3AyRvgAM4Guj7eeTnpuoX5EZUeOo6KgIA1RJ3BA!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic]. However, such release was only of the small responsibilities that Syria had to comply with and HRW criticized Syria for failure to meet the majority of these obligations. HRW and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/hrw-says-syria-officials-ordered-civilian-attacks-calls-for-icc-investigation.php">called for an ICC investigation</a> [JURIST report] concerning shootings of unarmed protesters by military officials and other <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-refer-syria-conflict-to-icc-for-investigation.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/articles/03022012Summary-Eng.pdf">supermajority decision</a> [summary, PDF], the Supreme Court Chamber overturned two decisions of the Trial Chamber. According to the Supreme Court Chamber, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/cambodia-genocide-court-hands-down-first-conviction-of-ex-khmer-rouge-leader.php">July 2010 decision</a> [JURIST report] imposing 35 years of imprisonment was made in error because it focused on the mitigating factors such as cooperation, regret and <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-duch-apologizes.php">apology</a> [JURIST report] rather than the seriousness of the crimes. The court emphasized that Kaing's role as head of <a href="http://www.fathom.com/feature/35706/">Security Center S-21</a> [Fathom backgrounder] and his crimes during his office. In addition, the Supreme Court Chamber found that remedies granted to Kaing for the illegal detention by Cambodian Military Court were wrong because the Trial Chamber considered only specific crimes against humanity, the Supreme Court entered additional convictions for crimes against humanity including extermination, enslavement and torture.

<p>Kaing is the only former Khmer Rouge leader to have been convicted by the ECCC. Ieng Sary, Ieng Thirith, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/cambodia-genocide-court-indicts-4-ex-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in September 2010. The ECCC ruled that Ieng Thirith was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/with-only-a-few-days.php">unfit to stand trial</a>, but the Supreme Court Chamber in December ordered that she <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-blocks-release-of-khmer-rouge-leader.php">remain in detention</a> [JURIST reports] and that the Trial Chamber exhaust all measures so that she can stand trial.

The Court found that a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-rejects-italy-high-court-order.php">2008 decision by Italy's Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] violated Germany's sovereign rights by allowing an Italian national to seek reparations in response to his deportation in 1944. Germany appealed this decision to the ICJ and <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/italy-seeks-damages-for-nazi-crimes-at-un-tribunal.php">oral arguments were heard</a> [JURIST report] in September 2011. Germany argued that allowing the ruling to stand would violate state immunity and open the floodgates to new claims. The Italian representatives alleged that the Italian court's ruling was necessary to secure compensation because all other avenues had failed. The ICJ found that this "last resort" notion was not a viable argument, because redress in international law is not based upon the availability of other manners of compensation. The ICJ would not erode state sovereignty for this action:<blockquote> In so far as the argument based on the combined effect of the circumstances is to be understood as meaning that the national court should balance the different factors, assessing the respective weight, on the one hand, of the various circumstances that might justify the exercise of its jurisdiction, and, on the other hand, of the interests attaching to the protection of immunity, such an approach would disregard the very nature of State immunity. </blockquote> This ruling by the ICJ is final and binding, effectively ending thousands of reparations claims against Germany. 

<p>In October 2008 the Court of Cassation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_ottobre_21/cassazione_stragi_germania_c8b20ca4-9f87-11dd-b0d4-00144f02aabc.shtml">awarded the damages</a> [<em>Corriere della Sera</em> report, in Italian] in a case against Max Josef Milde, a German sergeant present at the Civitella attack, who was sentenced <em>in absentia</em> to life in prison. Under Italian law, crime victims may seek civil damages as part of a criminal proceeding. Germany had argued that the 1961 Bonn Treaty, where Germany agreed to pay 40 million marks to Italy for war crimes committed, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-rejects-italy-high-court-order.php">closed all further financial compensation claims</a> [JURIST report], but the Italian court held the treaty only applied to treatment of the Jews. International agreements that govern situations in which a nation may claim immunity include the <a target="_blank" href="http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/074.htm">European Convention on State Immunity</a> [text], ratified by members of the Council of Europe in 1972, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/4_1_2004.pdf">UN Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property</a> [text, PDF], adopted in 2004.

The decision came after an appeal by Della Corte, who tried to have the parental rights of her ex-wife, Angelica Rameriez, revoked in divorce proceedings since she could never be a "husband," as defined by the Massachusetts law. The court found that even though Rameriez had no biological connection with the child and that the child was conceived before the marriage, she should still be considered a legal parent. Since the child was born after the marriage, both women should be considered legal parents. The appeals court relied heavily on a 2003 Supreme Judicial Court ruling that eliminated gender descriptions.<blockquote>In [2003], the Supreme Judicial Court specifically noted that without the right to civil marriage, same sex couples were required to "undergo the sometimes lengthy and intrusive process of second-parent adoption to establish their joint parentage." As a result, it follows that when there is a marriage between same-sex couples, the need for that second-parent adoption to, at the very least, confer legal parentage on the nonbiological parent is eliminated when the child is born of the marriage.</blockquote>Corte is reviewing the decision with her lawyer and is contemplating whether to pursue further legal action. 

<p>Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriages in 2004 and has since issued licenses to more than 16,000 same-sex couples. In March 2009, a group of Massachusetts plaintiffs who were or had been married under the state's same-sex marriage law <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/massachusetts-ag-challenges-defense-of.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the federal <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=doma">Defense Of Marriage Act</a> [JURIST news archive]. Other jurisdictions have also enacted same-sex marriage laws. Currently, seven US jurisdictions recognize same-sex marriage: <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, Massachusetts, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Washington</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiff, <a href="http://bottincarto.com/pro/nous.asp?page=pos&lang=EN">Bottin Cartographers</a> [corporate website], alleged that Google provides its maps service for free, thereby undercutting competitors, in order to gain market control. The court ordered that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/03/google-fined-france-maps-free">Google must pay &#163;415,000 to the plaintiff</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], as well as a &#8364;15,000 fine, totaling about $680,000. This is the first conviction against Google's maps service. The attorney for Bottin Cartographers said the decision "recognized the unfair and abusive character of the methods used and allocated Bottin Cartographes all it claimed." Google plans to appeal the ruling.

<p>Many of Google's services have been called into question recently. Earlier this month, Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">defended its new privacy policies</a> to US lawmakers after <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">8 congressmen questioned the new policies</a> [JURIST reports]. In August the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] announced that the agency had reached a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-announces-500-million-google-settlement.php">$500 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Google for unlawfully permitting Canadian pharmaceutical companies to advertise to and target US consumers. In July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-allows-google-to-appeal-street-view-ruling.php">extended settlement negotiations</a> [JURIST report] over a 2005 copyright suit filed against Google over its <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a> [corporate website] book scanning project. Also in July another federal judge ruled that Google could <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-allows-google-to-appeal-street-view-ruling.php">appeal a decision permitting a wiretapping lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over Google's <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/">Street View</a> [corporate website] service. Google was accused of violating user privacy by using WiFi networks to collect data for the service, a charge that came as a result of a <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2010/06/connecticut-ag-launches-multistate-privacy-investigation-against-google.php">multistate investigation</a> [JURIST report] that began in June of 2010.

He was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/canada-deports-rwanda-war-crimes-suspect.php">deported from Canada to Rwanda</a> [JURIST report] nine days ago, following a 16-year battle in the Canadian court system in which Mugesera attempted to stay in Canada. The Quebec Superior Court <a href="http://www.jugements.qc.ca/php/decision.php?liste=58538174&doc=E5EEA1CD98D359E9134B14142CC0F3A5544E5109C2D0E014D398AECD96CC29BD&page=3">ruled last month</a> [judgment, in French] that it did not have jurisdiction over the case. Mugesera is facing charges relating to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16694130">speech he made</a> [BBC report] when he was a member of the ruling Hutu party in Rwanda in 1992. His speech, in which he equated Tutsis to cockroaches who needed to be exterminated, allegedly led to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rwanda+genocide">1994 Rwandan Genocide</a> [JURIST news archive], in which 800,000 individuals, mainly Tutsis, were killed. Mugesera asked the Rwandan judge at his appearance Thursday for a month or two to search for a lawyer and was granted a stay until April 2.

<p>The Quebec Superior Court's decision to deport Mugesera was delayed one last time in January. In a final attempt to stay in Canada, he appealed to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/">UN Committee Against Torture </a> [official website], asking it to investigate his case and determine whether he would face inhumane torture if he returned to Rwanda. While Mugesera asked the court to <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/120120/alleged-rwandan-war-criminal-gets-weekend-canada">hold off ruling</a> [<em>Global Post</em> report] until the committee could complete an investigation, the court ruled the following Monday to deport him. In 2005, a Canadian justice said Mugesera should not be deported unless Rwanda gave a binding promise <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/no-deportation-of-rwanda-war-crimes.php">not to pursue the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] against him after the Canadian Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/canadian-high-court-says-rwandan.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] that he be deported. Mugesera has been fighting deportation in Canadian court since 1995, when the Canadian government charged him with omitting material documents from his asylum application.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There are currently two prisoners requesting extension, and they both cite the recent mail review controversy as to why they have been unable to meet the current deadline. Navy Cmdr. Walter Ruiz, the lawyer appointed to represent Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsaw,i claims that the new restrictions on legal mail between attorneys and their clients prevented Ruiz from meeting the deadline. The attorneys for Ramzi Binalshibh andal-Hawsawi are <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/02/02/2621667/defenders-seek-another-911-trial.html">both asking for extensions</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report].

<p>In January, Chief Defense Counsel for Guantanamo war crimes tribunals, Colonel J.P.

The EU is concerned the privacy policy, which will combine various policies of more than 60 of its products into one, may be in violation of EU laws. Google released details of its <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/">new privacy policy</a> [corporate website] last week, saying it will make it easier to share user information between different products, as well as enhancing search engine capabilities. Google also claims the policy will be simpler and easier for users to read and understand. Although the EU has not pinpointed which areas of the policy it is concerned with, it would like a chance to investigate the terms before they take effect. Google responded to the letter in statements Friday, stating that it had already briefed data protection agencies on the new policy and giving no indication that it plans to delay implementation.

<p>Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">responded Wednesday to concerns</a> [JURIST report] of US Congressmen about the new policy as well. It responded to 11 questions posed in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">letter sent by the Congressmen</a> [JURIST report] last week. Some topics of concern addressed by Google included assurance that no new types of data will be collected, reasons supporting data-sharing between Google products and an explanation of how data can be deleted by users once their accounts are closed. It also assured that it will comply with conditions of its 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">settlement with the FTC</a> [JURIST report], in which Google was charged with breach of consumer privacy rights and misleading consumers during the launch of Google Buzz, a social networking site.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The referral to a court-martial means <a href="http://www.times-standard.com/ci_19888754">Manning will now stand trial</a> [AP report] on 22 counts brought against him for his alleged disclosure of over 700,000 confidential documents and videos to the Wikileaks website. It was the largest leak of classified information in US history. Manning's defense lawyers argue he should have never been sent to Iraq nor given access to the confidential information because he was emotionally troubled. Prosecutors for the military presented evidence at a preliminary hearing in December showing that Manning downloaded battle reports, diplomatic cables, and a video of a helicopter attack by the US Army and sent them to WikiLeaks. Manning may face life imprisonment if convicted of "aiding the enemy." A judge has yet to be appointed to preside over the trial and a trial date has not yet been set.

<p>WikiLeaks has recently revealed more confidential information concerning the United States. In August, the website <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/wikileaks-releases-classified-guantanamo-documents.php">began publishing "The Guantanamo Files"</a> [JURIST report], a collection of more than 700 classified documents relating to the evidence and treatment of almost all detainees held at Guantanamo Bay between 2002 and 2008. In November 2010, US Attorney General Eric Holder, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/doj-announces-wikileaks-criminal-investigation.php">condemned WikiLeaks</a> [JURIST report] for its publication of confidential information, saying that it threatens US national security, specifically by risking the safety of those serving the country and straining important diplomatic relationships. WikiLeaks has alleged the information must be revealed to the public as evidence of potential crimes against humanity. In July 2010, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said that the Afghan War Diaries, a compilation of 91,000 documents leaked to the organization on the US war effort in Afghanistan, <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/wikileaks-founder-alleges-documents-may-reveal-us-war-crimes-in-afghanistan.php">may provide evidence</a> [JURIST report] of war crimes committed by US forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The government requested an additional 30 minutes, which would bring the total time allotted for oral argument to six hours. The government is <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-government-defends-health-care-minimum-coverage-requirement.php">defending</a> [JURIST report] the health care minimum coverage requirement by attempting to <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/01/health-care-debate-reopens/#more-136085">keep the focus of the argument on health care reform as a whole</a> [SCOTUSblog report], rather than on the specific minimum coverage provision. Arguments are scheduled for March 26&#8211;28.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> to rule on health care reform law</a> [JURIST report] in three separate cases, originally reserving five-and-half-hours for oral argument on the issue. The court agreed to hear two hours of arguments on the constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate issue in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-398.htm">Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-398%20Cert%20Petititon.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. The court will consider Issue 1, which asks, "whether Congress had the power under Article I of the Constitution to enact the minimum coverage provision." The court also directed parties to brief and argue the question of whether the challenge to PPACA is barred by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [26 USC &#167; 7421(a)], reserving one hour for argument on that issue. The court consolidated the cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-393.htm">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-393%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-400.htm">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-400%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and will hear 90 minutes of oral argument on the question of whether the individual mandate provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. Finally, the court will hear one hour of oral argument on the question of Medicaid expansion&#8212;Issue 1 in <span class="casename">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>: "Does Congress exceed its enumerated powers and violate basic principles of federalism when it coerces States into accepting onerous conditions that it could not impose directly by threatening to withhold all federal funding under the single largest grant-in-aid program...?" All three cases that the court agreed to hear arose out of the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which ruled in August that the individual mandate is <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/eleventh-circuit-rules-individual-health-care-mandate-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional but severable</a> [JURIST report], upholding the rest of the law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision upheld the original conviction of the <a href="http://www.scientologie.fr/">Spiritual Association of the Church of Scientology</a> (ASES) [church website, in French], an affiliated bookstore, and seven other members for fraud and illegal practice of pharmacy. The <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/church-of-scientology-faces-criminal.php">complaint was originally filed</a> [JURIST report] by a woman who was recruited in 1998 and spent &#8364;21,000 on the church and was then not allowed to leave or receive a reimbursement. The appeals court <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iGJeXWr0b3grZWf7pubFZIk9B8_Q?docId=b52a4ca13a0c4ae482b5893ba63a2a36">ordered the ASES to pay &#8364;400,000</a> [AP report] and the bookstore to pay &#8364;200,000 in damages to the woman and two other plaintiffs. France does not recognize Scientology as a religion, but the court denied the plaintiffs' request to disband the group in France entirely. 

<p>Scientology, founded by American science fiction author L Ron Hubbard in 1954, has also been challenged in Russia, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-court-bans-scientology-texts.php">recently banned its main texts</a> [JURIST report]. Prior to that, in 2009, Russia attempted to block Scientology from registering as a religion, which prompted the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/europe-rights-court-rules-russia.php">condem the decision as discriminatory</a>. That same year, Belgian prosecutor Jean-Claude Van Espen said Scientology <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/belgian-prosecutor-recommends.php">should be classified as a criminal organization</a> [JURIST report] after completing a 10-year investigation into the church's activities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Effectively, this bill would allow adoption agencies to refuse to adopt to same-sex couples. <a href="http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official profile] said he will sign the bill if it makes it to his desk. The bill provides, in relevant part:<blockquote>No private child-placing agency shall be required to consider or consent to any placement of a child for foster care or adoption when the proposed placement would conflict with the religious tenets of any sponsor of the agency or other organization or institution with which the child-placing agency is affiliated or associated. ... Refusal of a private child-placing agency to consider or consent to any placement of a child pursuant to this section shall not form the basis of any claim for damages.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/">Virginia Board of Social Services</a> already adopted similar regulations in December. This legislation would prevent those regulations from being changed.

<p>Last month an <a href="paperchase/2012/01/iowa-court-orders-both-same-sex-parents-be-included-on-birth-certificate.php">Iowa court ruled</a> that both same-sex parents' names must be recorded on birth certificates. In October the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/supreme-court-asked-to-review-putting-gay-adoptive-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/adar-v-smith">Adar v. Smith</a> [backgrounder], in which a same-sex couple asked Louisiana to include both of their names on the birth certificate of their adopted child. In April the Arkansas Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/arkansas-high-court-upholds-decision-to-strike-gay-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a state ban on adoptions by same-sex couples. The Supreme Court of Mexico in August 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/mexico-high-court-upholds-mexico-city-same-sex-adoption-law.php">upheld a Mexico City law</a> [JURIST report] allowing adoptions by same-sex couples. Two years before that, a Florida court <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/florida-judge-rules-gay-adoption-ban.php">ruled that a state statute</a> [JURIST report] preventing same-sex couples from adopting children was unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Wagnon had been facing a charge of murder for his alleged involvement in the killing of three Afghan civilians and was expected to go to trial in March. All four of the other soldiers charged in connection with the killings were either convicted or pleaded guilty. In a statement Friday, Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield did <a href="http://www.military.com/news/article/charges-against-final-kill-team-soldier-dropped.html">not go into detail</a> [<em>News Tribune</em> report] about why the charges against Wagnon were dropped, only saying that they were dropped "in the interest of justice." Wagnon was the last of the five soldiers, all members of the 5th Stryker Brigade, to go in front of the court-martial.

<p>Sgt. Calvin Gibbs was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-army-soldier-convicted-of-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">convicted of three counts</a> [JURIST report] of premeditated murder in November and was sentenced to life in prison. Gibbs admitted that he cut off fingers from the bodies to keep as trophies but claimed he was acting in self-defense and that they had fired first. Specialist Jeremy Morlock had <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-solider-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in March to the same premeditated murders and received a sentence of 24 years in prison. As part of his plea deal, Morlock agreed to testify against Gibbs and the rest of his co-defendants. Private Andrew Holmes <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/second-us-soldier-pleads-guilty-to-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to murder in September and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-soldier-sentenced-for-murder-of-afghanistan-civilians.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to seven years in prison as part of a plea deal. A month earlier, Specialist Adam Winfield also <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/whistleblower-soldier-pleads-guilty-in-afghan-civilian-death.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to involuntary manslaughter in connection with the deaths, and was sentenced to three years in prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court dismissed challenges brought against Utah Governor Gary Herbert and Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff for lack of standing, saying there was insufficient evidence that the state officials had any intention to prosecute the family under these laws. The challenges against Buhman were allowed to stand, however, because there was sufficient evidence that complaints made to county officers had led to an investigation, and there was reason to infer that the county might pursue prosecution under the law. The family <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/utah-polygamy-law-challenged-in-federal-lawsuit.php">challenged the law</a> [JURIST report] in July as a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, saying they are not pursuing legal recognition of their marriage, but simply want to end prosecutions against them and other families who choose this lifestyle.

<p>Kody Brown and his four wives, the plaintiffs in this case, are stars of TLC's reality show <a href="http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/sister-wives">Sister Wives</a> [official website]. A <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50366251-76/bigamy-brown-wives-paul.html.csp">police investigation</a> [Utah News report] against them has been ongoing since September 2010, when the show was first announced and premiered. Utah's <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010100.htm">Anti-Bigamy Statute</a> [statute, text] has been on the books since 1862. While polygamy is now recognized in most of Africa and the Middle East, it is still illegal in most of North and South America, Europe and China. In 2005, the US District Court for the District of Utah <a href="/thisday/2011/02/16/federal-judge-rejected-challenge-to-utah-polygamy-ban.php">rejected a similar lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought against Utah's Anti-Bigamy Statute, reaffirming the 1879 US Supreme Court case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1104642225155375579">Reynolds v. United States</a> [text], which upheld a conviction under an anti-polygamy law as constitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The men <a href="http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&i=7846">face charges</a> [<em>Tripoli Post</em> report] of murder and helping prisoners escape. The court postponed the trial in response to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/05/us-libya-trial-idUSTRE8140MA20120205">pleadings</a> [Reuters report] by the defense panel that the case be transferred to the civil judiciary because the military court allegedly lacks competence to rule on the issue. The trial is set to resume on February 15.

<p>Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, faces the death penalty in Libya for crimes against humanity based on charges of killing protesters. If he is transferred to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to stand trial, he would be one of the most prominent figures to be tried by the ICC. Last week, in response to international criticism, the Libyan Ministry of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/libya-to-take-control-of-makeshift-prisons.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will be commandeering "makeshift prisons" around the country to prevent further torture of detainees. Deputy Minister Khalifa Ashour acknowledged that primarily loyalists to former dictator Gaddafi have been tortured in unregulated prisons. Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread in the aftermath of the Libyan conflict. In January <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] reported the recent deaths of several Libyan detainees who were apparently <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/libya-torture-causing-prisoner-deaths-ai.php">tortured while in custody</a> [JURIST report].

The suspects, including 19 Americans, other foreigners and Egyptians, have been <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/641846">charged with promoting democracy in Egypt</a> [<em>Egypt Independent</em> report] without proper documentation and by using illegal funds. Egyptian officials are preventing the suspects from leaving the country. The accused include employees of the <a href="http://www.iri.org/">International Republican Institute</a> (IRI), the <a href="http://www.ndi.org/">National Democratic Institute</a> (NDI) and <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/">Freedom House</a> [advocacy websites]. US Ambassador to the UN <a href="http://usun.state.gov/leadership/c31461.htm">Susan Rice</a> [official profile] on Monday called on Egypt to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72494.html">release the suspects</a> [Politico report], including an IRI employee who is also the son of US <a href="http://www.dot.gov/bios/lahood.htm">Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood</a> [official profile]. US Secretary of State <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/c27775.htm">Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] has also threatened to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/05/us-egypt-ngo-usa-idUSTRE8140PX20120205">reconsider the $1.3 billion in annual aid</a> [Reuters report] given to Egypt. International aid organizations have condemned the decision to bring the NGO employees to trial. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/05/egypt-rights-activists-risk-prison">urged the Egyptian government to drop the charges</a> [press release] until the country's "new parliament proposes legislation consistent with international legal standards." HRW also suggested that the investigative judges who referred the cases to the court were acting on behalf of government officials, a claim that Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Amr refuted Monday, saying that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gNJqLva_jObVOJ2RfiSOJOXGcOrg?docId=b933fde7833544de8a15cdc92dbf7eb4">government could not control the judiciary</a> [AP report]. Trial dates have not yet been scheduled. 

<p>Egypt's crackdown on NGOs has drawn criticism for months. In January, the Egyptian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/egypt-government-denies-crackdown-on-ngos.php">denied cracking down on pro-democracy NGOs</a> after officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-state-department-egypt-to-halt-raids-on-pro-democracy-groups.php">raided the offices of 17 different NGOs</a> [JURIST reports] the previous week. Authorities stated that the raid was part of an investigation of illegal political funding activities, but accusations spread that the government was trying to silence the military council's vocal opposition. A spokesperson for the US State Department said that the raids on NGOs did not positively reflect the Egyptian government's commitment to democracy. Despite Egypt's assurances to the US that it would return to the NGOs all property and assets seized in the raids, the Egyptian military also proclaimed that it would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/29/us-egypt-groups-idUSTRE7BS0PT20111229">not tolerate foreign interference</a> [Reuters report] in the nation's affairs. This week's decision to investigate NGO employees coincides with <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=146446387">ongoing violence in Egypt</a> [NPR report], where more than 70 people were killed Thursday during a riot in a soccer stadium and as many as 13 killed in protests during the last five days. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN Working Group also criticized the overcrowding in police and prison facilities in Central America. The investigation consisted of visits to 11 prisons along with various meetings with lawyers, human rights organizations and members of society. Prisoners interviewed privately complained of invasive and humiliating searches of themselves, as well as their relatives and lawyers. Despite awareness by authorities and society of the importance of human rights, the conditions surrounding detention in El Salvador remain problematic. The Working Group expressed concern that the 1998 Criminal Procedure Code, which would safeguard human rights guarantees, was not fully implemented by El Salvador. The report states:<blockquote>The Working Group considers the need to address the problem of security in the country as a legitimate and critical issue of concern. It believes that the right to security is an important human right that is interlinked with the right to life. At the same time the Working Group reiterates that the right to liberty and to be free from arbitrary deprivation of liberty is also of extraordinary value and that there is a dire need to safeguard both fundamental rights. The need for public security cannot therefore be pursued or achieved without due consideration of the right to liberty and the right to be free from arbitrary arrest and detention.</blockquote>A final report is expected to be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in 2013.

<p>Human rights groups have been increasingly vocal about the need for human rights amidst recent protests and investigations of detention facilities. In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/hrw-releases-2012-world-report.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual World Report, leading with a criticism of Western governments' support of Middle Eastern regimes that stifle and suppress protests. In December, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-refer-syria-conflict-to-icc-for-investigation.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] for investigation into crimes against humanity committed by the Syrian government. An estimated 7,000 detainees are still being held without due process by Libyan revolutionaries, according to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/libya-revolutionaries-continue-to-detain-suspected-gaddafi-mercenaries-un-report.php">UN report</a> [JURIST report] made public in November. In October, <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/default.aspx?/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] released a report stating that the prisoners in some Afghan-run detention facilities have been beaten and tortured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Defendants Ted Goodwin, Claire Blehr, Lawrence Egbert and Nicholas Alec Sheriden were arrested for allegedly violating that law by running an assisted death operation. They pleaded not guilty and the Supreme Court of Georgia <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/georgia-high-court-reviewing-assisted-suicide-law.php">reviewed</a> [JURIST report] the law last November. Georgia law does not explicitly forbid assisted suicide but does ban individuals from publicly advertising suicide. The opinion states that Georgia legislatures could have imposed a ban to all assisted suicide or offers followed by action that would not have infringed on the right to free speech. The court said, "[i]t is not all assisted suicides which are criminalized but only those which include a public advertisement or offer to assist. This distinction takes the statute out of the realm of content neutral regulations and renders it a selective restraint on speech with a particular content." The charges against the four defendants were dismissed. State attorneys are reviewing the order and opponents said they are concerned it will <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i2fKlk7lPJsrB4f7s3AA-wDyU73Q?docId=6256d680b78845b09216ed241a144d77">open the state to more assisted suicides</a> [AP report].

The court upheld in part and reversed in part a lower court ruling, agreeing with its finding that physician assisted suicide is not illegal under state law, but giving no opinion on the greater constitutional question addressed by the lower court. Instead, it found in a 4-3 decision that physician assisted suicide was not rendered illegal under state statute or by public policy concerns. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/countries/mm/mandate/bio.htm">Tomas Ojea Quintana</a> [official profile], who spoke to reporters at the end of a six-day visit, praised the country for its recent reforms, such as a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/myanmar-begins-release-of-political-prisoners.php">presidential pardon that will free a total of 651 political prisoners</a> and the creation of laws to protect freedom of the press and <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/myanmar-president-approves-peaceful-protest-bill.php">freedom of speech during peaceful protests</a> [JURIST reports]. However, Quintara expressed concern about the independence of the judiciary and its ability to uphold new laws, and he suggested that the chief justice seek support from the international community to make reforms and ensure impartiality in the courts. He also mentioned the need for continued investigations into alleged human right abuses:<blockquote>I remain of the firm conviction that justice and accountability measures, as well as measures to ensure access to the truth, are fundamental for Myanmar to move forward towards national reconciliation. During my mission, I made a careful assessment as to whether the National Human Rights Commission could play a role in this regard. However, considering the lack of independence and the limited capacity of the Commission, it is crucially important that the Government of Myanmar involve stakeholders, including victims of human rights violations, in order to get their advice and views on how and when to establish truth, justice and accountability measures. It is also important to learn lessons from other countries that have experience in these processes.</blockquote>Myanmar will hold elections on April 1, which Quintara predicted would be a "key test" in measuring the success of the recent reforms. 

<p>Myanmar has made a series of reforms following a transfer of power from a military regime to a civil system last March. Last month Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thein Sein</a> [BBC backgrounder] signed a clemency order on that shortened sentences for many prisoners on humanitarian grounds in celebration of Myanmar's independence day. In December the Myanmar government announced that the political party of opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=suu+kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [JURIST news archive] would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/suu-kyis-party-granted-legal-status-for-myanmar-elections.php">allowed to register for the next elections</a>, an announcement that followed <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">Suu Kyi's release</a> [JURIST reports] in November after eight years under house arrest. In September, Myanmar's government <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/myanmar-government-forms-human-rights-commission.php">created the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission (MNHRC)</a> [JURIST report] to safeguard citizens' constitutional rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iopt0212webwcover.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] describes the policy that causes separation within Palestinian families since some are trapped inside Israel while their family members are forbidden from entering. Israel was also criticized by HRW for never disclosing its rationale for imposing the restrictions on travel and residency. In the report, HRW Middle East director stated:<blockquote>Israel has never put forth any concrete security rationale for blanket policies that have made life a nightmare for Palestinians whom it considers unlawful residents in their own homes. The current policies leave families divided and people trapped on the wrong side of the border in Gaza and the West Bank. Israel should revise these policies and process requests for families to reunite, so that Palestinians can live with their families where they want.</blockquote>As part of the restrictions, Israel employs a population registry in which all Palestinians living in Israel must register in order to be allowed to travel within the country. Without a registration card, Palestinians are not permitted to re-enter Israel to see their family members. Recently, Israel has changed its policies regarding processing of applications that would allow split families to be reunited, among others, in such a way that the applications are slowly processed, making the time split families spend apart longer. Israel has not explained its reason for making the policy change. 

<p>While HRW has urged Israel to change its policies concerning Palestinian residencies, Israel has recently made some changes on its own accord to certain legislative policies. In January, an Israeli government panel <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-use-of-nazi-symbolism.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would make it illegal to use any Nazi symbols, names, or images, including the use of the term "Nazi" and any clothing resembling that worn by prisoners at concentration camps. Also in January, the Israeli Knesset <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-approves-new-law-to-deter-illegal-migrants.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that imposes harsher penalties on illegal migrants in Israel, as well as on Israelis who help illegal migrants. The bill amends the Prevention of Infiltration Law of 1954, broadening the law to include not only individuals suspected of terrorism, but all illegal migrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He made his application for bail after <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/europe-rights-court-blocks-deportation-of-muslim-cleric.php">winning an appeal</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] to avoid deportation to his native Jordan. A court in Jordan previously found him <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/02/06/uk-britain-preacher-bail-idUKTRE8151FX20120206">guilty <em>in absentia</em></a> [Reuters report] of two bomb plots. The ECHR ruled in January that he could not be deported because it is questionable as to whether he would receive a fair trial due to some evidence possibly being obtained by torture. Qatada has been described as "Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe," and UK officials believe he should be kept in prison for national security reasons. Qatada has never formally been charged with an offense, and he has been in and out of custody either in prison or some form of house arrest. He will again be released on house arrest.

<p>In February 2009, a five-judge panel of the UK's Law Lords ruled unanimously that Qatada <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/uk-court-rules-muslim-cleric-can-be.php">could be deported</a> [JURIST report] to Jordan despite fears he might be tortured upon his arrival. This decision overruled an April 2008 decision by the Court of Appeal <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/uk-appeals-court-blocks-terror.php">blocking</a> [JURIST report] deportation. Qatada was <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/uk-immigration-panel-orders-deportation.php">originally ordered deported</a> [JURIST report] in February 2007. He was expected to be one of the first terror suspects to be deported under the UK's 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/uk-jordan-reach-agreement-on.php">extradition oversight agreement</a> [JURIST report] with Jordan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/Special%20Interest%20Item/S.%201867.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for 2012</a> (NDAA) [SB 1867, PDF], allows for sanctions such as those ordered by Obama to be imposed on Iran. In a letter he sent to Congress, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/06/message-blocking-property-government-iran-and-iranian-financial-institut">Obama explained</a> [statement] that the sanctions were necessary because of the misleading practices of Iranian banks, including the Central Bank of Iran, which are alleged to employ practices involving the concealment of forbidden transactions and the placement of inadequate anti-money laundering protocols. The sanctions block any property of Iran or its banks that fall under US jurisdiction. Reports have indicated that the sanctions are an <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gbHvZu-K-Cory_ih9hYX-oe2seTg?docId=CNG.140193182099c94896011e481c454233.21">attempt to convince Iran to disassemble its nuclear program</a> [AFP report] by placing a strain on its already struggling economy. Sanctions may also be imposed on other foreign banks that conduct business with the Central Bank of Iran.

<p>The NDAA was not <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/obama-signs-controversial-defense-bill.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] without controversy. According to Obama, his administration will implement the controversial provisions, including that saying "all necessary and appropriate force" may be used to detain those suspected of terrorism, in a manner which will provide the maximum measure of flexibility. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) vigorously chastised the President stating that the statute is dangerous due to its lack of temporal or geographic limitations. Both houses of Congress <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/congress-reaches-agreement-on-controversial-defense-bill.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] on the language of the NDAA's most controversial sections in mid-December. Earlier in December, the Senate Armed Services Committee <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-grant-military-complete-control-over-al-qaeda-suspects.php">unanimously approved</a> [JURIST report] a provision in the NDAA that gives the military complete control and custody over terror suspects. Shortly before the SASC's decision, the ACLU issued a report [pdf] claiming that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">US is diminishing its "core values"</a> [JURIST report] with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the 9/11 attacks. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Nasri was convicted of terrorism association two years ago, after he was <a href = "/paperchase/2009/12/four-guantanamo-detainees-transferred.php">transferred from Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report] to stand trial in Italy. He was <a href = "/paperchase/2011/02/italy-court-convicts-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">sentenced to six years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for recruiting martyrs to commit acts of terrorism. Nasri and his lawyer alleged that he was <a href = "http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/02/06/news/terrorismo_otto_anni_a_guantanamo_ma_a_milano_viene_assolto_in_appello-29447490/">tortured extensively</a> [<em>la Repubblica</em> report, in Italian] while being detained by US forces. It is unknown if this influenced the court's decision, as Nasri contended that he was beaten until he admitted he was part of al Qaeda. The court also upheld the sentence of Tlili Lazar under similar charges. Reasoning behind the two decisions will be released in the next 30 days.

<p>In April, Italy <A href = "/paperchase/2011/04/italy-deports-former-guantanamo-detainee-to-home-country-of-tunisia.php">deported a different Tunisian national</a> [JURIST report] and former Guantanamo Bay detainee for his connections to an extremist group that had planned various acts of terrorism in the country.

Nasheed, the country's first democratically-elected president, <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=11&dcid=6727">stepped down</a> [press release], saying in a public address: "I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, the people of the country would suffer more. ... I wish the Maldives would have a consolidated democracy. I wish for justice to be established." His vice president, <a href="http://www.drwaheed.com/dr_waheeds_biography">Mohammed Waheed Hassan</a> [official profile], took over the presidency Tuesday afternoon, vowing to <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=11&dcid=6734">uphold the rule of law</a> [press release], protect the <a href="http://www.maldivesinfo.gov.mv/home/upload/downloads/Compilation.pdf">Maldives Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and prevent any attempted retaliation against former leaders. Hassan, who has worked as a <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [official website] official, had <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0207/Trouble-in-paradise-Maldives-president-steps-down-amid-protests">called for the Mohamed's release</a> [CSM report] while serving as vice president. Mohamed was arrested in an unprecedented move by the military, following his ruling to release a government critic. Local media on Tuesday evening reported that <a href="http://minivannews.com/politics/live-police-join-opposition-protests-attack-military-headquarters-31592">Mohamed had been released</a> [<em>Minivan</em> report]. 

<p>The Maldives has faced ongoing unrest since Mohamed's arrest, as well as other political struggles following the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/maldives-president-signs-new.php">adoption of its constitution</a> [JURIST report] in late 2008. Last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-maldives-must-release-or-charge-arrested-judge.php">UN called for Mohamed's release</a> days after the Maldives <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.mv/new/">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] asked the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-seeks-un-help-to-resolve-detention-of-senior-judge.php">help them resolve</a> [JURIST reports] what they called a judicial system failure. The same week, a group of Maldives lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-lawyers-seek-icc-intervention-over-detained-judge.php">submitted</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] the case, calling Mohamed's continued detention a violation of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disappearance-convention.htm">International Convention on the Protection of all Persons against Enforced Disappearance</a> [text]. In the country's first democratic elections in 2008, Nasheed defeated longtime political opponent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7658672.stm">Maumoon Abdul Gayoon</a> [BBC profile], ending his 30-year rule. During today's street protests, some worried that the violence may have been a coup attempt by Gayoon, but the government has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/07/maldives-protest-idUSL4E8D74SX20120207">denied</a> [Reuters report] such claims. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tomka, who has been vice president of the ICJ since 2009, has also worked for the Slovakian <a href="http://www.mzv.sk/en/home">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and has held several UN positions, including being a member of the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/ilc/">UN International Law Commission</a> [official websites]. <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/index.php?p1=1&p2=2&p3=1&judge=158">Judge Bernardo Sepulveda-Amor</a> [official profile] of Mexico will serve as vice president. Sepulveda-Amor has been a member of the ICJ since 2006 and was previously an Ambassador of Mexico to the US, the UK and Ireland, worked as the Mexican <a href="http://www.sre.gob.mx/english/">Secretary of Foreign Relations</a> [official website] and has held numerous UN positions. The ICJ, located in The Hague, is the UN's highest court and settles disputes between governments and issues advisory opinions on topics presented by UN bodies. The court consists of 15 judges elected for nine-year terms by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> and the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official websites]. No two judges can come from the same home country, and efforts are taken to ensure that the primary world legal systems are represented.

<p>The ICJ is currently reviewing 13 cases. Last week, the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/icj-rules-germany-immune-from-nazi-victim-claims.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Germany has immunity from claims brought in foreign courts by victims of the Nazi regime. The court found that a <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/germany-rejects-italy-high-court-order.php">2008 decision by Italy's Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] violated Germany's sovereign rights by allowing an Italian national to seek reparations in response to his deportation in 1944. Germany appealed this decision to the ICJ, which <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/italy-seeks-damages-for-nazi-crimes-at-un-tribunal.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in September 2011. The ruling by the ICJ is final and binding, effectively ending thousands of reparations claims against Germany. In December, the ICJ ruled that Greece <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icj-rules-greece-wrong-to-block-fyrom-bid-to-join-nato-over-name.php">wrongly blocked</a> [JURIST report] the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) from joining the <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website] in a dispute over the use of the name "Macedonia." Greece objects to FYROM's use of "Macedonia" out of concern that the country will use the moniker to <a href="/dateline/2008/05/greece-macedonia-issue.php">make claims to regions of Northern Greece</a> [JURIST comment] that also are known by the name Macedonia. The ICJ order may have been a largely symbolic victory for FYROM because the court did not sanction Greece, nor did it order the country to refrain from taking similar action in the future. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">voter-approved</a> [JURIST report] constitutional amendment violates the  <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process">Due Process</a> and <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection">Equal Protection Clauses</a> [Cornell LII backgrounders] of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. According to the court:<blockquote>Although the Constitution permits communities to enact most laws they believe to be desirable, it requires that there be at least a legitimate reason for the passage of a law that treats different classes of people differently. There was no such reason that Proposition 8 could have been enacted. Because under California statutory law, same-sex couples had all the rights of opposite-sex couples, regardless of their marital status, all parties agree that Proposition 8 had one effect only. It stripped same-sex couples of the ability they previously possessed to obtain from the State, or any other authorized party, an important right&#8212;the right to obtain and use the designation of 'marriage' to describe their relationships. ... Proposition 8 serves no purpose, and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gays and lesbians in California, and to officially reclassify their relationships and families as inferior to those of opposite sex couples. The Constitution simply does not allow for "laws for this sort."</blockquote>The court also found that Proposition 8 supporters had standing to appeal and dismissed a motion to vacate the judgment below over claims of judicial bias. Judge NR Smith dissented, finding that Proposition 8 is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. An appeal is expected to the full Ninth Circuit and eventually to the US Supreme Court. It is unclear if and when same-sex marriages will resume in California.

<p>Last week the Ninth Circuit ruled that videos from the Proposition 8 trial must <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-seals-videos-from-california-same-sex-marriage-trial.php">remain sealed</a> [JURIST report]. The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-proposition-8-issues.php">heard arguments</a> in December on whether the video recordings should be released to the public and whether the district court should have vacated Judge Vaughn Walker's <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rules-proposition-8-unconstitutional.php">original ruling</a> [JURIST reports] because he later revealed that he was in a same-sex relationship. The Ninth Circuit initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">heard arguments</a> on Proposition 8's constitutionality in December 2010, but then <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">asked the California Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports] to rule on whether defendants had standing to appeal. The high court ruled in November that they did <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/california-high-court-rules-proposition-8-sponsors-may-defend-it-in-court.php">have standing</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his ruling, Judge Sam Sparks noted that he was ordering the enforcement of the law following a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-sonogram-law.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website], <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/11/11-50814-CV0.wpd.pdf">lifting an injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] of the law and ordering immediate enforcement. Sparks criticized the Fifth Circuit's ruling, stating that the law <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/judge-says-he-was-forced-to-dismiss-challenge-2155428.html">infringed upon the First Amendment rights</a> [<em>American-Statesman</em> report] of physicians by improperly limiting their ability to exercise their medical judgment. According to Sparks, the law severely limits the right to free speech in the abortion context, and essentially makes physicians a <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Texas-sonogram-law-goes-into-effect-today-3085314.php">mouthpiece of the state</a> [<em>Houston Chronicle</em> report]. Following the ruling issued by Sparks, the Texas Department of State Health Services [official website] released a <a href="http://www.dhsh.state.tx.us/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=8589963266">letter to providers</a> [text, PDF] indicating that enforcement would begin immediately and informing them of their responsibilities under the law. The <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> (CRR) [advocacy website], which filed the challenge to the law on behalf of a class of doctors, has filed a petition requesting that the Fifth Circuit rehear the case <em>en banc</em>. In response to Sparks' ruling, CRR President Nancy Northup <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/hands-tied-by-appeals-court-texas-district-court-decides-it-cannot-permanently-block-stat">stated</a> [press release], "[i]t is a terrible injustice that Judge Sparks could not rule in favor of protecting the constitutional rights of Texas doctors because of the Fifth Circuit panel's decision." Northup also urged the Fifth Circuit to apply Sparks' reasoning if the case is reheard <em>en banc</em>.

<p>Texas <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/">Governor Rick Perry</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">signed the measure into law</a> in May, but it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-key-provisions-of-texas-abortion-law.php">blocked</a> in August after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">challenge</a> [JURIST reports] from the CRR. Laws similar to the Texas law have also been considered in other states. Early this month, the Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound before the procedure. The law would impose requirements including the audio provision of fetal heartbeat and a determination of the gestational age of the fetus. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010 the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judgment came following the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-tribunal-accepts-war-crimes-lawyers-contempt-plea.php">acceptance of a plea agreement</a> [JURIST] last week. Rasic was the former case manager for Bosnian war criminal <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/milan_lukic_sredoje_lukic/tjug/en/090720_j.pdf">Milan Lukic</a> [judgment, PDF]. She <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/contempt_rasic/ind/en/100922.pdf">pleaded guilty</a> [amended indictment, PDF] last week to five counts of contempt against the tribunal last year. It was alleged that she "knowingly and willfully interfered with the Tribunal's administration of justice" by obtaining false witness statements in the Lukic case in exchange of 1,000 euros. The court stated that Rasic's conduct was serious in that it directly interfered with the administration of justice having far-reaching consequences to the international criminal jurisdiction:<blockquote>With respect to aggravating circumstances, the Chamber notes the position of trust in which Jelena Rasic found herself in at the time of her crimes. Members of Defence teams are obligated to act conscientiously with full respect of the law and applicable rules, something which certainly also holds true for any professional involved in the proceedings before the Tribunal. As officers of justice, they must at all times be aware of their duties and must never allow themselves to affect others, such as prospective witnesses, in a criminal manner. However, Jelena Rasic did just that.</blockquote>The court also considered numerous mitigating factors such as the possibility that Rasic was merely following directions, her relative young age and inexperience, her guilty plea and the fact that she is the only female detainee in the detention unit. Consequently, the court suspended the last eight months of the sentence as well as the 78 days Rasic already served in detention.

<p>The ICTY is currently <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icty-war-crimes-suspect-demands-compensation-for-trial-delays.php">facing a suit</a> [JURIST report] initiated by <a href="http://www.vseselj.com/">Vojislav Seselj</a> [official website, in Serbian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=seselj">news archive</a>], a former Serb nationalist politician and war crimes suspect, for unreasonable delay in his trial. He claims USD $2.6 million in damages. He was charged with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes, and in October he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-sentences-seselj-to-18-months-for-contempt-of-court.php">sentenced to 18 months</a> [JURIST report] for releasing information of protected witnesses. In December the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icty-convicts-former-yugoslav-intelligence-officer-of-contempt-for-failure-to-testify.php">convicted a former Yugoslav intelligence officer</a> [JURIST report] on charges of contempt for failing to testify. Court argued that such failure was against the interest of justice. In the same month, former Serbian general <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/mladic-pleads-not-guilty-trial-set-for-march.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to charges for executing more than 30 Muslim prisoners. Earlier of the month, ICTY with <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribune for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-war-crimes-tribunals-report-progress-to-security-council.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] their progress in tracking and arresting fugitives for the tribunals' mandates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtnew.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Attorneys for Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_020612_1070FilingOpeningBrief.pdf">filed an opening brief</a> [text, PDF] with the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Monday, asking the court to lift an injunction that has blocked many contentious provisions of a state <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">news archive</a>] from taking effect. SB 1070, passed in April 2010, makes illegal immigration a state crime and requires police officers to question an individual's immigration status if the officer has a "reasonable suspicion" to believe an individual is in the country illegally. In its brief, Arizona argued that its controversial immigration law is necessary because illegal immigration poses a severe threat to the state's well-being and Congress has been negligent in its enforcement of federal immigration laws:<blockquote>The result [of lax federal enforcement] has been the funneling of an increasing tide of illegal border crossings into Arizona. Indeed, over the past decade, over a third of the nation's illegal border crossings occurred in Arizona. ... This flood of unlawful cross-border traffic, and the accompanying influx of illegal drugs, dangerous criminals and highly vulnerable persons, have resulted in massive problems for Arizona's citizens and government, leaving them to bear a seriously disproportionate share of the burden of an already urgent national problem.</blockquote>In December, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">agreed to hear this case</a> [JURIST report], entitled <span class="casename">Arizona v. United States</span>, to determine whether or not SB 1070 is preempted by federal law. Oral argument is scheduled for April 25.

<p>SB 1070 has had a polarizing effect since its passage. Legislatures in states such as <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-legislature-approves-new-version-of-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports] have passed immigration laws in the past two years that mirror Arizona's. While SB 1070 has spawned many new state laws in its image, it has also attracted sharp criticism. In July 2010, the <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/aba.html">American Bar Association</a> (ABA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/aba-files-second-brief-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] urging the <a href="http://www.azd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Arizona</a> [official website] to block SB 1070 from taking effect. The ABA's brief came on the heels of a US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] lawsuit challenging the SB 1070's constitutionality. In May 2010, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/aclu-files-lawsuit-seeking-injunction-against-arizona-immigration-law.php">filed a suit seeking to block implementation of the new law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in May 2010, a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-rights-experts-say-arizona-immigration-law-may-violate-international-standards.php">argued that SB 1070 may violate international standards</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In particular, UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado said that, "[a]s of the end of January, 400 children are dead and more than 400 have been detained." Mercado added that UNICEF has also received reports of arbitrary child arrests, torture and sexual abuse while in detention. Although she did not reveal the source of the reports, Mercado declared that the figures came from Syrian human rights groups "that we find to be credible." She also said that reporting by international media inside the city of Homs has contributed to UNICEF's awareness. Specifically, some reports indicated that Syrian troops have increased their assault on Homs by using artillery and shelling against civilians as part of their broader plan to quash a public pro-democracy movement that began last year. UNICEF believes that the shelling of civilian neighborhoods is undoubtedly <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41157&Cr=Syria&Cr1=">causing further suffering for children</a> [UN News Centre report]. "This must stop," said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. "Even one child killed in the violence is one child too many." UNICEF does not currently have access to the affected areas of Homs, but has urged Syrian authorities to allow help to those who need it.

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/hrw-syria-forces-torturing-children.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Syria's army and security officers of engaging in the <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/03/syria-stop-torture-children">torture of children</a> [press release]. The allegations stemmed from HRW's documentation of cases in which children were reportedly detained, tortured, and shot in their homes, as well as prior findings that the Syrian government has been involved in torturing and killing civilian protesters. HRW has subsequently urged the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to take action and pressure the Syrian government to end the inhumane violence against children still allegedly occurring in homes, streets, and schools. Last month, UN Secretary General <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] Syria's president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder] to end the violence against its citizens and strive to establish democracy. Ban previously <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-condemns-escalating-syrian-violence.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Syrian government leaders and violent protesters in December for the continuous bloodshed within the country. The violence in Syria has also been decried by the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-council-condemns-violence-in-syria.php">UN Human Rights Council</a>, the UN General Assembly's <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-body-passes-resolution-condemning-syria-violence.php">Human Rights Committee</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-arab-league-denounce-syria-violence.php">Arab League</a> [JURIST reports]. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40708">reported</a> [UN report] that more than 5,000 people have died since the anti-government protests in Syria began last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=900156&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Axel Springer AG v. Germany</a> [judgment], the court examined whether a German actor's right to privacy was violated when a paper published a newspaper article and photos of his arrest for illegal drug possession at a public festival. The court determined that an injunction restricting publication of articles and photos of the actor was a violation of Article 10 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/CONVENTION_ENG_WEB.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], which protects freedom of expression. The court determined that the actor was sufficiently well known to qualify as a public figure, which gives the public a greater interest in being informed about his arrest and the proceedings against him. Additionally, the court determined that the actor had a decreased expectation of privacy due to the fact that his arrest occurred at a public event and because he had previously released details of his private life through the media. In <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=900154&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">Van Hannover v. Germany</a> [judgment], the court examined whether the right of privacy of members of the royal family of Monaco had been violated when two magazines published pictures of Princess Caroline of Monaco and her husband that were taken without their consent during a ski vacation. The court ruled that publication of the pictures did not constitute a violation of Article 8 of the Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees a right to respect for private and family life. The court held that the pictures and accompanying text added to a debate of general interest about the royal family of Monaco, and that members of that family must be treated as public figures. In both cases, the court acknowledged the need to balance the right to privacy against the right of the media to freedom of expression, but also indicated that privacy rights are diminished when individuals can be considered public figures. 

<p>The ECHR rulings could have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/technology/08iht-privacy08.html">broad implications going forward</a> [NYT report] and may play a role in the UK as the British government <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/UK-panel-to-investigate-whether-country-needs-tougher-media-regulations.php">investigates</a> [JURIST report] whether tougher media regulations are necessary. In July, British <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/People/David_Cameron.aspx">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] announced the formation of a panel to investigate journalism practices in the nation, after <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/former-newspaper-ceo-arrested-in-phone-hacking-scandal.php">allegations of "phone hacking"</a> [JURIST report] surfaced in the British media. The panel is investigating the media and reporters' relationship with police and politicians, as well as the tactics media agents use to get information. While the UK judges are <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uk-top-judge-national-courts-not-bound-by-europe-rights-court.php">currently split</a> [JURIST report] over the role ECHR decisions should play in the British court system, the ECHR's ruling could limit media reforms proposed by the panel, particularly regarding coverage of celebrities. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The prosecution alleges that Berlusconi <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16933697">published the transcript of a tapped phone conversation</a> [BBC report] in <a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/"><em>Il Giornale</em></a> [media website, in Italian], a national newspaper owned by his brother. The conversation in question took place between Berlusconi's biggest political rival at the time, <a href="http://www.pierofassino.it/default.aspx">Piero Fassino</a> [official website, in Italian], and the head of Unipol, an insurance company that has since been restructured. The publication broke secrecy rules, as the conversation should have remained private due to the ongoing investigation into possible inappropriate interference in Unipol's attempt to take over Italian banking firm <a href="http://www.bnl.it/wps/portal">Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</a> (BNL) [official website, in Italian]. The publication was widely viewed as an attempt by Berlusconi to damage Fassino and other center-left opponents. During the hearing Tuesday Berlusconi told the court that he had not listened to the tape at the time, nor had he ordered its release. This will be Berlusconi's fourth pending trial, as he is already facing charges of <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-appears-in-court-calls-tax-fraud-hearing-a-waste-of-time.php">tax fraud</a> and paying for sex with an <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports]. The wiretap trial is set to begin March 15.

<p>Berlusconi, who resigned as prime minister in November, has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases. In July an Italian appeals court ordered <a href="http://www.fininvest.it/en/holding/profile">Fininvest</a> [corporate website], a holding company owned by Berlusconi, to pay &#8364;560 million in damages and fees to <a href="http://www.cirgroup.com/">Compagnie Industriali Riunite (CIR) Group</a> [corporate website]. The complaint stemmed from Fininvest's 1991 acquisition of Italian publishing company <a href="http://www.mondadori.com/">Mondadori</a> [corporate website], during which Fininvest bribed a judge in exchange for favorable decisions. In April neither Berlusconi nor the alleged prostitute attended the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-trial-for-prostitution-and-abuse-of-power-charges-ajourns-after-10-minutes.php">beginning of the prostitution trial</a> [JURIST report], and the court adjourned after only 10 minutes. Both parties deny having a sexual relationship and Berlusconi has denied any wrongdoing, calling the accusations groundless. In January 2011 the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_320.do">Italian Constitutional Court </a>[official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">immunity law</a> [materials, in Italian] backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary amnesty from any charges while holding office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/DOJ-rejects-new-South-Carolina-voter-ID-law.php">rejected the law</a> [JURIST report] in December on the grounds that it was discriminatory. It has authority to do so under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder], which allows it to screen new voter laws in states with a history of discriminatory voter practices. In the filing, the attorney general alleges that the photo identification requirement will not disenfranchise voters.<blockquote>South Carolina's photo identification law only places upon the voter an affirmative responsibility to obtain an approved photo identification card and bring it to the polls. ... Because these photo identification requirements are not a bar to voting but a temporary inconvenience no greater than the inconvenience inherent in voting itself, they do not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority.</blockquote>The complaint cited a 2008 Supreme Court decision which <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/supreme-court-allows-indiana-voter.php">upheld a similar Indiana law</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/voting-rights/department-justice-blocks-south-carolinas-discriminatory-voter-id-law">praised</a> [press release] the DOJ for its actions in blocking the law. The advocacy group alleges that the new law would have prevented thousands of eligible voters from exercising their right.

<p>There are now 30 US states that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 14 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In Wisconsin, several civil rights groups filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in December challenging the <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/23">new voter identification law</a> [2011 Wisconsin Act 23]. In June 2011, Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo identification at voting booth. In March 2011, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October 2010. In October 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that Arizona could <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/supreme-court-rules-arizona-voter-id.php">enforce its voter ID law</a> [JURIST report], which requires voters to show government-issued <a href="/currentawareness/idcards.php">voter ID cards</a> [JURIST news archive] at the polls.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Monsignor Charles Scicluna, the church appointed prosecutor in the ongoing <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=church+sexual+abuse">clergy sex abuse</a> [JURIST news archive] scandals, issued his warning at a symposium of bishops, the purpose of which was to begin formulating guidelines to keep children safe. In February 2010, the Vatican <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/vatican-releases-church-response.php">unveiled church procedures</a> [JURIST report] for dealing with sexual abuse cases, titled the "Guide to Understanding Basic CDF Procedures concerning Sexual Abuse Allegations", which set up a multi-tiered system of enforcement, including local bishops and the Pope himself. Church law provides for sanctioning those who cover-up or ignore abuse as negligent or malicious in performing their job duties. 

<p>Clergy abuse has become a contentious legal issue in recent years, as the Vatican has come under intense scrutiny related to allegations of sexual abuse of children by local church officials. In November a UK court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uk-court-rules-catholic-church-could-be-liable-for-clergy-abuse.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Catholic priests qualify as employees, meaning that the Catholic church could be held liable for sexual abuse by clergy members. In September <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ireland-clergy-abuse-amounts-to-torture-rights-group.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that clergy members' abuse of Irish children amounted to torture. The report, titled <a href="http://www.amnesty.ie/sites/default/files/INPLAINSIGHT%20(WEB_VERSION).pdf">In Plain Sight</a> [text, PDF] called special attention to "people in positions of power" who "ignore their responsibility to act." Also in September, the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-files-icc-complaint-against-vatican-over-clergy-abuse.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] against Vatican officials, including Pope Benedict XVI, for widespread sexual abuse and subsequent concealment of thousands of incidents. Since 2007, the Church has <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=diocese+abuse">settled over 500 cases</a> [JURIST news archive] of clergy abuse in the U.S. alone, totaling more than $900 million.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The request comes after one indigenous group occupied portions of the Pan-American Highway in protest of mining and drilling activities taking place on their lands. As a result of these protests and clashes with the police, one person was killed and many others were detained or injured. Anaya called upon the government to insure that people involved in such protests are protected and asked for an investigation into the death of the protester. Other indigenous groups have announced plans to protest in a show of solidarity and to display their displeasure at the lack of legalization of their lands.

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing issue in recent years. In December 2010, US President Barack Obama announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/us-pledges-support-for-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">US will support</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/drip.html">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People</a> [text]. The declaration, <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/un-adopts-treaty-supporting-rights-of.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] in 2007, is a non-binding treaty outlining the global human rights of approximately 370 million indigenous people and banning discrimination against them. The US was one of four member states that originally opposed adopting the treaty, citing concerns that its text conflicted with their countries' own laws, among other contentions. The US is the last member state of those in opposition to sign the declaration. Earlier in 2010, <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/canada-endorses-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">Canada endorsed</a> [JURIST report] the declaration citing encouragement from community leaders and other countries' experiences in reversing its position on the document. In August 2010, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on governments to work to <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/un-sg-calls-for-greater-efforts-on-indigenous-rights.php">improve the human rights conditions</a> [JURIST report] of the world's indigenous peoples. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The contempt charge stems from Gilani's refusal to purse corruption charges against Pakistan <a href="http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/">President Asif Ali Zardari</a> [profile]. Gilani has maintained that he would not pursue charges against President Zardari because the president has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2012/02/20122853758450883.html">immunity as the head of state</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The conflict between the prime minister and the court stems from an order which <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2009, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999. If he is convicted of contempt Gilani could lose his public office and be sent to prison for up to six months. This is only the second time that contempt charges have been filed against a sitting prime minister in Pakistan's history. 

<p>These proceedings reflect an ongoing struggle between the government and the courts in Pakistan. In December, the Supreme Court formed a judicial committee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/pakistan-supreme-court-to-investigate-memo-scandal.php">investigate a secret memo</a> [JURIST report] sent from an unknown Pakistani source to US Admiral Mike Mullen in May asking for help in preventing a suspected army coup. Zardari and former Pakistan ambassador to the US Husain Haqqani have been accused of writing or having knowledge of the memo, and both have denied these allegations. In October 2011, the Supreme Court issued a judgment urging political parties to <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/pakistan-top-judge-orders-political-parties-to-cut-ties-with-%20criminal-gangs.php">stop financing criminal groups</a> [JURIST report] responsible for increased violence in the city of Karachi. The decision stated that militant groups have gained strength because of support from local political groups and order the Pakistani government to help address the corruption. The court struck down the NRO in 2009, which was <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/musharraf-signs-amnesty-agreement-for.php">signed </a>[JURIST report] by former Pakistani president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4797762.stm">Pervez Musharraf</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=musharraf">news archive</a>] in 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed legislation is a <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE81701A20120208">new version of another bill</a> [Reuters report] first introduced in October 2009. The <a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/btb/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Bill-No-18-Anti-Homosexuality-Bill-2009.pdf">original bill</a> [text, PDF] contained provisions requiring the death penalty for "repeat offenders." It is not clear whether the new bill has removed some of these provisions, but AI Deputy Africa Programme Director Michelle Kagari urged that the bill is dangerous either way:<blockquote>The bill introduces draconian provisions on top of Uganda's existing prohibition on consensual same-sex relations, which already violates international norms. It aims to criminalize the "promotion" of homosexuality, compels HIV testing in some circumstances, and imposes life sentences for entering into a same-sex marriage. It would also be an offence for a person who is aware of any violations of the bill's wide-ranging provisions not to report them to the authorities within 24 hours...This deplorable bill would not only violate the rights of Ugandans to life, to non-discrimination, to equality before the law, and to privacy, but would sanction hatred, violence and the persecution of a group of people based on whom they love alone.</blockquote>AI expressed concern that the revived bill may not need committee review before being passed into law, which could expedite its passage. The original bill was set aside last May, after receiving widespread criticism from the international community. 

<p>Uganda faces an ongoing struggle with anti-gay sentiment in the country. In November the <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/cases/UGHC/">Ugandan High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">sentenced a man to 30 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for beating to death prominent gay rights activist David Kato. In January 2011 the Ugandan High Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/uganda-high-court-rules-anti-gay-newspaper-article-violated-constitutional-rights.php">issued a permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] and awarded damages to three plaintiffs who were among 100 people alleged to be homosexuals by the Ugandan tabloid newspaper, <em>The Rolling Stone</em>. In January 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-proposed.php">criticized the original anti-gay legislation</a> [JURIST report], saying that it could harm Uganda's reputation internationally. In February 2010, US President Barack Obama and <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">publicly denounced the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report].

Pillay argued that the failure of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to agree on collective action against Syria has encouraged the Syrian government to attack and kill civilians in order to quash dissent. Pillay declared that the Syrian government's violence against its own people constitutes a "serious international crime" and called on world leaders to honor a 2005 agreement to protect basic human rights: <blockquote>At their 2005 Summit, World leaders unanimously agreed that each individual State has the responsibility to protect its population from crimes against humanity and other international crimes ... They also agreed that when a State is manifestly failing to protect its population from serious international crimes, the international community as a whole has the responsibility to step in by taking protective action in a collective, timely and decisive manner ... The virtual carte blanche now granted to the Syrian Government betrays the spirit and the word of this unanimous decision. It is depriving the population of the protection they so urgently need.</blockquote> The statement comes in response to the recent increase in attacks on civilians by the Syrian army, especially in the city of Homs.

<p>Human rights groups have sharply criticized the Syrian government for using violence against its own people. Earlier this week, the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] claimed</a> that eleven months of violence in Syria has <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">led to the deaths of hundreds of children</a> [JURIST report]. Last week, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/hrw-syria-forces-torturing-children.php">accused the Syrian army of torturing children</a> [JURIST report]. In January, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder] end violence against Syrian civilians. In December, the UN <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-again-urges-security-council-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">urged the UN Security Council</a> [JURIST report] to refer Syrian government officials to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website]. In November, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/syria-forces-committing-crimes-against-humanity-against-humanity-hrw.php">declared that Syrian forces were committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report], including torture and unlawful killings of anti-government protesters.

The statements come in response to a controversial 2010 directive authorizing the use of such information that was <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE81625D20120207">obtained earlier this week</a> [Reuters report] by a Canadian news agency through freedom of information laws. The directive allows the CSIS to use information which may have been obtained through torture under extreme circumstances. This order is an expansion of a 2009 ministerial order, which expressly forbids the use of information obtained through torture. The latest directive carves out a narrow exception to the 2009 order, which Toews argued was necessary to protect the lives of Canadian citizens. The directive was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/16943268">criticized</a> [BBC report] by representatives from the <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/">Liberal Party</a> and the <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/">New Democratic Party</a> [official websites], who argued it may not be legal. 

<p>Torture has been at the center of controversy in Canada recently. In January, the Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/canada-deports-rwanda-war-crimes-suspect.php">deported Rwandan war crimes suspect Leon Mugesera</a> [JURIST report], despite claims that he would <a href="http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mugesera-returns-to-rwanda/article2311566/?service=mobile">face torture and possible death</a> [<em>Globe and Mail</em> report] if removed to Rwanda. The <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/tribunaux/super-a.htm">Quebec Superior Court</a> [official website] determined that they did not have jurisdiction to rule on immigration cases. In November 2009, a former senior Canadian diplomat, during testimony before the House of Commons <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/CommitteeBusiness/CommitteeHome.aspx?Cmte=AFGH&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=40&Ses=2">Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan</a> [official website], alleged that the <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/senior-canada-diplomat-accuses-military.php">Canadian military was complicit in the torture of Afghans</a> [JURIST report] by their own government. <a href="http://www.amnesty.ca/">Amnesty International Canada</a> and the <a href="http://www.bccla.org/">British Columbia Civil Liberties Association</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/afghan-detainees-have-no-rights-under.php">filed complaints</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 against the <a href="http://www.vcds.forces.gc.ca/cfpm-gpfc/index-eng.asp">Canadian Forces Provost Marshal</a> [official website], alleging complicity in torture by Canadian personnel serving in Afghanistan. Amnesty accused Canada of violating the <a href="http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text] by turning Afghan detainees over to Afghan authorities without any protection against later cruel and unusual punishment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Washington currently grants <a href = "/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">expanded domestic partnership rights</a> [JURIST report] rather than full marriage or civil union rights to same-sex couples. The <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/washington-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Senate passed the bill</a> [JURIST report] last week, and <A href = "http://www.governor.wa.gov">Governor Christine Gregoire</a> [official website] is expected to sign it into law next week. Gregoire has been a major supporter of gay rights in her term as governor and originally proposed a marriage bill in the state Congress. In a <a href = "http://www.governor.wa.gov/news/news-view.asp?pressRelease=1852&newsType=1">statement</a>, she praised the bill's passage:<blockquote>This is truly a historic day in Washington state, and one where I couldn't be more proud. With today's vote, we tell the nation that Washington state will no longer deny our citizens the opportunity to marry the person they love. We tell every child of same-sex couples that their family is every bit as equal and important as all other families in our state. And we take a major step toward completing a long and important journey to end discrimination based on sexual orientation.</blockquote>Opponents of same-sex marriage have promised to challenge the imminent law with a referendum, similar to <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>] in California. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional. If a ballot initiative in Washington is not achieved, same-sex marriages could begin as early as June.

<p>Washington is poised to become the eighth jurisdiction in the US to legalize <A href = "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J-3yWRH-yi4/TsFNuYBY57I/AAAAAAABLrA/GcaLWUm5_fM/s1600/MarriageMap.jpg">same-sex marriage</a> [US map]. In a similar situation, New Jersey is considering legalizing same-sex marriage soon, although it currently has a civil union system in place. In November, a <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the New Jersey State Constitution. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in <A href = "/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports]. The case for same-sex marriage was recently made by JURIST contributor <a href = "http://jurist.org/staff/#kimberly">Kimberly Bennett</a> in <a href = "/dateline/2012/01/kimberly-bennett-gay-rights.php">Judicial Activism and the Recognition of Same-Sex Marriage</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mohanad Shareef Hammadi is charged with attempting to provide material support to terrorists and terrorist organizations and conspiracy to transfer weapons to terrorist organizations, specifically <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=al+Qaeda">al Qaeda</a> [JURIST news archive]. Judge Thomas Russell, after assessing all of the prosecution's files, ruled that Hammadi's attorneys may not review warrants and information gained by surveillance, in addition to withholding that information from the actual trial. The prosecution obtained the information under the <a href = "http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/50C36.txt">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA) [text], a law used primarily to collect intelligence on foreign agents and foreign terrorism suspects. Hammadi's attorney is <a href = "http://www.times-standard.com/ci_19918712">pursuing a plea agreement</a> [AP report]. Hammadi is set to go to trial on July 30.

<p>The <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">Senate Armed Services Committee</a> [official website] on Wednesday finally agreed on a controversial detainee provision of the <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/Special%20Interest%20Item/S.%201867.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for 2012</a> [SB 1867, PDF] in November that governs the handling and prosecuting of suspected <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-qaida.htm">al Qaeda</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder] detainees. The provision allows the military to have complete custody and control over terror suspects and grants authority to <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] over whether suspects should be tried in military or civilian courts. Issues of "secret evidence" have been broached in other courts as well. Last year, the UK <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2011/07/uk-supreme-court-bars-secret-evidence-in-guantanamo-trials.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that secret service organizations cannot withhold evidence from opposing parties nor conduct closed trials. The appellants, secret service organizations including <a href = "https://www.mi5.gov.uk/">MI5</a> [official website], appealing a May 2010 <a href = "/paperchase/2010/05/uk-appeals-court-denies-use-of-secret-evidence-in-detainee-torture-case.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report], requested the creation of a  "closed material procedure," saying the disclosure of their evidence to the appellees, former Guantanamo detainees, would be contrary to the public interest. The court rejected this idea, citing the public interest immunity (PII) doctrine as more than suitable for classified information as evidence, and that it was not in the judiciary's power to allow or enforce a new doctrine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Last month, the Yemeni parliament approved a bill <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/yemen-parliament-grants-immunity-to-outgoing-president-saleh.php">granting complete immunity</a> [JURIST report] to Saleh for crimes committed during his regime in exchange for him stepping down. In the report, HRW <a href="http://www.hrw.org/node/105035">recommends</a> [press release] that all countries "impose an asset freeze and travel ban on President Saleh" and other top Yemeni official implicated in the alleged human rights violations. HRW argues that countries should take such actions in order to "[p]ublicly express opposition to any grant of immunity to Yemeni officials who may have been responsible for serious violations of international human rights or humanitarian law [and to m]ake clear that such immunity has no effect in jurisdictions outside of Yemen." Saleh is currently in the US receiving medical treatment. He is expected to return to Yemen sometime before the countries presidential election scheduled for February 21. 

<p>Criticism of Yemen's handling of the situation with Saleh has been ongoing since the country first announced it would give him complete immunity. Last month Yemen's newly appointed Council of Ministers <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/yemen-cabinet-approves-immunity-for-abdullah-saleh.php">approved a draft law</a> [JURIST report] to grant Saleh immunity from any charges against him for alleged human rights violations from his time in office. A couple of weeks later, Yemeni officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/yemen-amends-immunity-law-for-salehs-associates.php">amended that law</a> [JURIST report] to give Saleh's associates only limited immunity. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=139">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-chief-urges-yemen-to-deny-amnesty-for-human-rights-violations.php">spoken out against granting immunity</a> [JURIST report] because of concerns that it might be too broad. In April, Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down</a> [JURIST report] in exchange for immunity. The UN is <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-investigators-to-asses-yemen-human-rights-situation.php">investigating human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen in relation to its handling of pro-democracy protests. Saleh and his party, the General People's Congress (GPC), had caused political tensions that led to the protests through their <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/yemen-parliament-gives-preliminary-approval-to-abolish-presidential-term-limits.php">attempts to remove presidential term limits</a> [JURIST report] and expand their political power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation, initiated by Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>], prohibits probation and sentence deferrals for perpetrators and provides that repeat offenders could face up to life in prison. Offenders are also permitted to voluntarily submit to chemical castration, a reversible process consisting of a series of chemical injections that hinder the effects of the male hormone testosterone. Offenders who are close relatives, teachers, or caregivers of child victims or employees of childcare institutions may be subject to more severe penalties. The legislation was passed by 354 of 450 voting members.

According to the Caribbean Human Development Report 2012, the "region is home to 8.5 percent of the world's population, yet it concentrates some 27 percent of the world's homicides. Violence and crime are therefore perceived by a majority of Latin American and Caribbean citizens as a top pressing challenge." <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41175&Cr=caribbean&Cr1=">Gang-related violence</a> [press release] specifically plays a large role in destabilizing economies throughout the Caribbean. The report estimates that the cost of gang-related crime is between 2.8 and 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the region. The cost of policing is a factor, but so too is the loss of income by incarcerated youths and the loss of potential tourism revenues. The report indicates that "[h]igh rates of violent crime can be turned around by achieving a better balance between legitimate law enforcement and preventive measures, with a stronger focus on prevention."

<p>The UN has expressed similar concern about rising homicide rates in the Central American region of the world. In October of last year, a <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/index.html">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/central-american-homicide-rates-reaching-crisis-point-un.php">report </a>[JURIST report] found that homicide rates in Central American countries, including El Salvador and Honduras, are reaching a "crisis point." The report found that young men in Central and Southern America, Central and Southern Africa and the Caribbean are at the greatest risk of intentional homicide. In June 2010, the UNODC <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-releases-report-detailing-impact-of-global-organized-crime.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the globalization of organized crime and its threat to international security. The report specifically addressed the global economic impact of human and drug trafficking, sale of illicit firearms, piracy, identity theft and the illegal exploitation of natural resources. The report echoed <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/un-official-stresses-need-for-international-efforts-in-fighting-organized-crime.php">warnings issued by the UNODC</a> [JURIST report] in May 2010, stating that the inadequacies of the current international crime control system are allowing organized crime organizations to gain economic strength.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court announced in October that <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/spain-former-judge-to-face-trial-for-illegal-wiretap-order.php">Garzon would stand trial</a> on the charges after the he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-high-court-indicts-judge-garzon-for-jailhouse-wiretap-order.php">indicted in April</a> [JURIST reports] for ordering the placement of wiretaps in jailhouses to record conversations between inmates and their lawyers. Garzon gave the order as part of an investigation into a network of businesses that allegedly gave money and gifts to members of Spain's Popular Party in exchange for government contracts. This investigation, now known as <a href="http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/escuchas/caso/Gurtel/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_9/Tes">"el caso Gurtel"</a> [<em>El Pais</em> report, in Spanish], was commenced by Garzon in 2009, with the wiretap order issued in February of that year. He based his order to wiretap the jailhouse on his belief that it would yield incriminating evidence as the lawyers may be acting as liaisons with others suspected of involvement in this network. The court suspended Garzon from practicing law for 11 years. 

<p>A <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-high-court-begins-second-trial-of-judge-garzon.php">second private prosecution</a> against Garzon related to <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/spain-high-court-charges-judge-garzon.php">abuse of power charges</a> [JURIST report] began in January and is ongoing. In that case, Garzon is charged with politically motivated corruption in his 2008 investigation of crimes committed under the Franco dictatorship in violation of the 1977 Amnesty Law, which affords amnesty for Franco-era crimes. During the investigation, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/spain-judge-starts-probe-of-franco-era.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] certain government agencies, the Episcopal Conference, the University of Granada and the mayors of four cities to produce the names of people buried in mass graves, as well as the circumstances and dates of their burial. In March, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/spain-judge-garzon-petitions-europe-rights-court-over-franco-probe.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging the 2010 charges of abuse of power. His petition follows the September 2010 decision of the Criminal Chamber of the Spanish Supreme Court, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/spain-high-court-confirms-decision-against-judge-garzon-in-franco-probe.php">unanimously confirmed</a> [JURIST report] a lower court order that Garzon abused his power and must face trial. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16959808">specific charges are unclear</a> [BBC report], but Nasheed maintains that the warrant is politically motivated. Nasheed, who <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=11&dcid=6727">resigned on Tuesday</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-president-resigns-after-protests-over-detained-judge.php">report</a>], has said that he was forced out of office in a coup. Nasheed told reporters Thursday that he would remain for the good of the country: "They are going to arrest me [but] I am certain that you cannot suppress anything by brute force. ... I am not leaving the country for my own safety. How can I do that? This country will go to the dogs if I leave." Nasheed's vice president, <a href="http://www.drwaheed.com/dr_waheeds_biography">Mohammed Waheed Hassan</a> [official profile], took over the presidency Tuesday afternoon. Hassan issued a <a href="http://www.presidencymaldives.gov.mv/Index.aspx?lid=11&dcid=6755">statement</a> [text] Thursday renewing "his commitment to restore peace and order in the country." Nasheed has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-asia-16945764">accused</a> [BBC report] Hassan, who had <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0207/Trouble-in-paradise-Maldives-president-steps-down-amid-protests">called for his removal</a> [CSM report] while serving as vice president, of participation in the coup. 

<p>The Maldives has faced ongoing unrest since the military in January <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">arrested the chief justice</a> of the nation's criminal court, Judge Abdulla Mohamed, after he released a detained opposition leader. Last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-maldives-must-release-or-charge-arrested-judge.php">UN called for Mohamed's release</a> [JURIST report] days after the <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.mv/new/">Maldives Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] asked the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-seeks-un-help-to-resolve-detention-of-senior-judge.php">help them resolve</a> [JURIST reports] what they called a judicial system failure. The same week, a group of Maldives lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-lawyers-seek-icc-intervention-over-detained-judge.php">submitted</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] the case, calling Mohamed's continued detention a violation of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disappearance-convention.htm">International Convention on the Protection of all Persons against Enforced Disappearance</a> [text]. In the country's first democratic elections in 2008, Nasheed defeated longtime political opponent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7658672.stm">Maumoon Abdul Gayoon</a> [BBC profile], ending his 30-year rule.

Forst focused on improvements such as the establishment of judicial offices, the adoption of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unhcr.org%2Frefworld%2Fdocid%2F3ae6b36c0.html&ei=xAU0T_LNMMLY0QHa483OAg&usg=AFQjCNGqn6yd6Ue2X7LUfI9Kx3l6suaZEg&sig2=YW1qtZx2uNc4Bl80X5hHOw">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> [text, PDF] and the recent <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-judge-convicts-8-police-officers-for-post-earthquake-prison-shooting.php">conviction of eight police officers</a> [JURIST report] in a post-earthquake shooting. He said he was disappointed in the recent decision by Haiti's Investigative Magistrate Carves Jean that former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/231156.stm">Jean-Claude Duvalier</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Jean-Claude+Duvalier">news archive</a>] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-ex-president-duvalier-will-not-face-trial-for-rights-violations.php">will not stand trial</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against humanity, including torture, false imprisonment, rape and murder during his reign between 1971 and 1986. Forst stressed that the government in Haiti must continue to prioritize the Rule of Law:<blockquote>President Martelly has made Rule of Law one of his top priorities for his mandate, but the implementation of the rule of law requires a sound political action to implement the technical decisions for which diagnoses were made long ago. To rule also means to send political signals. The population needs to see that the Rule of Law prevails in Haiti.</blockquote> Forst also indicated that Haiti must work to reduce the amount of time individuals spend in prison while awaiting trial. He urged Haiti to consider this and other human rights issues in preparation for its participation in the upcoming UN Council for Human Rights in Geneva. 

<p>Haiti has been urged numerous times by different organizations to improve its human rights records. Last month the Investigative Magistrate dismissed the charges against Duvalier, reasoning that there are not sufficient legal grounds and that the statute of limitations has expired. In September, AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/rights-group-urges-haiti-authorities-to-prosecute-former-haiti-president.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Haitian government to prosecute Duvalier after its release of a <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR36/007/2011/en/c1eaace5-e98b-4d9c-b0b6-48dcbd7b75ae/amr360072011en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] documenting crimes committed during the former president's reign. The findings were the result of an <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-to-probe-alleged-rights-violations-by-former-dictator-report.php">eight-month investigation</a> [JURIST report]. In July, the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/aboutUs/Pages/DeputyhighCommissioner.aspx">Kyung-Wha Kang</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-expert-urges-haiti-to-improve-rights-try-duvalier.php">pressed Haiti</a> [JURIST report] to establish a system of human rights and equality, especially by speeding up the case against Duvalier. He was accused of <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-ex-presdient-accused-of-crimes-against-humanity.php">crimes against humanity</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/haiti-files-theft-and-corruption-charges-against-former-president-duvalier.php">corruption</a> [JURIST reports] in January of last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

EPIC alleged that the changes to the privacy policy are in violation of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] reached by the FTC and Google in October over a breach of consumer privacy rights and misleading consumers during the launch of Google Buzz, a social networking service. EPIC claims that Google violated the settlement:<blockquote>by misrepresenting the extent to which it maintains and protects the privacy and confidentiality of covered information[,] ... by failing to obtain affirmative consent from users prior to sharing their information with third parties [and] ... by failing to comply with the requirements of a comprehensive privacy program.</blockquote>Epic is primarily concerned with Google's plans to share user data across its services without affirmative user consent. The new privacy policy is set to take effect March 1.

<p>Last week, the EU's data protection authorities wrote a letter to Google asking it to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/eu-asks-google-to-delay-new-privacy-policy.php">delay implementation</a> [JURIST report] of its new privacy policy.

It responded to 11 questions posed in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">letter sent by the Congressmen</a> [JURIST report] in January. Some topics of concern addressed by Google included assurance that no new types of data will be collected, reasons supporting data-sharing between Google products and an explanation of how data can be deleted by users once their accounts are closed. It also assured that it will comply with conditions of its settlement with the FTC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This agreement is the largest joint federal-state settlement ever obtained and includes mortgage servicers <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/home.htm">JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co.</a>, <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">Wells Fargo &#38; Company</a>, <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/homepage/">Citigroup Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.ally.com/financial/">Ally Financial Inc.</a> (formerly GMAC) [corporate websites]. Holder announced:<blockquote>The joint federal-state agreement requires servicers to implement comprehensive new mortgage loan servicing standards and to commit $25 billion to resolve violations of state and federal law, which include the use of "robo-signed" affidavits in foreclosure proceedings; deceptive practices in the offering of loan modifications; failures to offer non-foreclosure alternatives before foreclosing on the borrowers with federally insured mortgages; and filing improper documentation in federal bankruptcy court.</blockquote>The agreement will be filed as a consent judgment in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] with servicers required to fulfill the obligations within three years. The agreement does not prevent civil suits by individual homeowners or criminal charges pursued by federal or state authorities. Oklahoma was the only state not to participate in the agreement.

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/state-ags-to-investigate-foreclosure-practices.php">investigation began</a> [JURIST report] in October 2010 with the forming of a bipartisan group called the Mortgage Foreclosure Multistate Group (MFMG). In June 2010, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., a subsidiary of Bank of America, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/bank-of-america-subsidiary-reaches-108-million-settlement-with-ftc.php">reached a $108 million settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/index.shtml">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to resolve charges that the subsidiary collected excessive fees from homeowners facing foreclosure. In September 2010, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-aid-fraud-suit.php">refused to dismiss a suit</a> [JURIST report]  against <a href="http://www.aigcorporate.com/index.html">American International Group</a> (AIG) [corporate website], and in August, a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-rejects-sec-citigroup-subprime-mortgage-settlement.php">rejected a $75 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] between Citigroup and the US <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">Securities Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] because the two companies misled investors. In 2009, the US <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official website] rejected a <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN00896:">bill</a> [S 896 materials] that would have <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/senate-defeats-bill-to-aid-mortgage.php">aided homeowners in foreclosure</a> [JURIST report] by allowing bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages from lenders that had not already offered better terms to their borrowers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Without comment, the court <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/PAWIC/APUSnews/Article_2012-02-08-Death%20Penalty-Ohio/id-c9ca9dd1d2774c5ea97736d014079dc2">refused</a> [AP report] to allow Ohio to execute Charles Lorraine, a 45-year-old man who was convicted in 1986 of killing an elderly couple. Though Ohio <a href="http://governor.ohio.gov/">Governor John Kasich</a> [official website] rejected Lorraine's plea for mercy, the execution has been consistently delayed by federal courts over growing concerns that the state deviates too often from its lethal injection rules. Despite Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine's <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/January-2012/Attorney-General-DeWine-Appeals-Stay-of-Lorraine-E/Lorraine-SCOTUS-Appeal.aspx">argument</a> [text, PDF] that the state's minor deviations in death penalty policy do not make the process unconstitutional, the Supreme Court refused to reverse an earlier <a href="http://www.hamilton-co.org/cinlawlib/blog/Lorraine.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] made by the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] and <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0013p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [text, PDF] last month by the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/internet/default.html">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website]. Said the Sixth Circuit in affirming the opinion: <blockquote>We agree with the district court that the State should do what it agreed to do: in other words it should adhere to the execution protocol it adopted. As the district court found, whether slight or significant deviations from the protocol occur, the State's ongoing conduct requires the federal courts to monitor every execution on an ad hoc basis, because the State cannot be trusted to fulfill its otherwise lawful duty to execute inmates sentenced to death.</blockquote>The deviations in death penalty policy criticized by the district court include switching the official whose job it is to announce the start and finish times of the lethal injection and failing to properly document that the inmate's medical chart was reviewed.

<p>Ohio's death penalty procedures have received consistent attention over the past few years. Last November, Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/SCO/justices/oconnor/default.aspx">Maureen O'Connor</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-top-judge-questions-application-of-death-penalty-law.php">instructed the state's death panel review committee</a> [JURIST report] that its purpose was to provide "guidance on the current laws on the subject, the practices in other jurisdictions, the date, the costs, and many other aspects associated with the death penalty." The Chief Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/ohio-death-penalty-procedure-to-be-reviewed.php">announced the formation of the committee</a> [JURIST report] last September, declaring that it would be responsible for ensuring that the death penalty law is "administered in the most fair, efficient, and judicious manner possible." In March 2010, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/supreme-court-denies-stay-of-execution.php">refused to stay the execution of an Ohio inmate</a> [JURIST report] who challenged the state's single-drug lethal injection protocol, which was <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/ohio-to-adopt-single-drug-lethal.php">changed</a> [JURIST report] in November 2009 from the previously used three-drug method. Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-conducts-first-execution-with.php">conducted its first execution</a> [JURIST report] using the new method in December 2009. The change in protocol came after the state <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/ohio-governor-issues-execution.php">reviewed its lethal injection practices</a> [JURIST report] following a failed execution in September 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW said those executed were convicted of various crimes and counted a total of 51 in January and 14 in February. HRW also called for a moratorium on all future executions, and called for "an overhaul of [Iraq's] flawed criminal justice system." In its statement, HRW also said:<blockquote>Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned that Iraqi courts admit as evidence confessions obtained under coercion. The government should disclose the identities, locations, and status of all prisoners on death row, the crimes for which they have been convicted, court records for their being charged, tried, and sentenced, and details of any impending executions.</blockquote>HRW further commented that "many defendants are unable to pursue a meaningful defense or to challenge evidence against them, and lengthy pretrial detention without judicial review is common."

The draft of the electoral law was finalized on Wednesday after the <a href="http://libya360.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/draftelectorallawunofficialtranslation.pdf">earlier version</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/libya-ntc-publishes-draft-law-for-selecting-constitutional-assembly.php">report</a>] was revised to address criticisms of the public. The new law sets out procedures for the upcoming election to choose a national assembly. After elected, its responsibility will be to draft a new constitution for the country. The finalized law provides that 20 percent of the 200 seats (40 seats) will be reserved for women, double of what was proposed in the earlier version. The UNSMIL stressed the importance of the new democratic development in Libya:<blockquote>The first free election for over four decades will provide an opportunity for Libyans to exercise their democratic rights to participate in a process which will shape the future of their country. UNSMIL remains committed, as mandated by the UN Security Council, to assist and support Libyan national efforts to undertake political dialogue, promote national reconciliation and embark upon the electoral process.</blockquote>Local council members stated that they still have to address the issue of education, health care, and reconstruction.

<p>This finalization and adoption of the new electoral law is a significant step for Libya in establishing a democratic system after the end of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] regime and the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libyan conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last week, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/libya-trial-against-gaddafi-allies-postponed.php">trial against Gaddafi allies was postponed</a> [JURIST report]. The defense's pleading stated that the trial must be transferred to the civil court because the military court lacked the authority to rule on the issue. The trial will resume on February 15. Last month, Libya was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-human-rights-chief-addresses-alleged-torture-of-libyan-detainees.php">criticized for the allegations of torture and human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. Although the NTC expressed its commitment to human rights and legal reformation, <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] was still concerned due to the lack of NTC's control over the revolutionary brigades.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, only few citizens can hear the proceedings in person, and audio recordings are released after the proceedings are over. However, the bill would not make televising proceedings mandatory: "The Supreme Court shall permit television coverage of all open sessions of the Court unless the Court decides, by a vote of the majority of justices, that allowing such coverage in a particular case would constitute a violation of the due process rights of 1 or more of the parties before the Court." A similar bill, <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr3572ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr3572ih.pdf">The Cameras in the Courtroom Act of 2011</a> [HR 3572, PDF] is still pending in the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/">House Judiciary Committee</a> [official website]. 

<p>This bill, when first proposed, faced numerous criticism as well as support and initiated a longstanding <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-senate-debates-requiring-televised-broadcasts-of-supreme-court-proceedings.php">debate</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=9b6937d5e931a0b792d258d9b3652fe2">hearing materials</a>] among judiciary and congressional officials. Supporters argued that the bill would create a more transparent government and secure citizens' right to access governmental materials. On the other spectrum, there was concern that parts of the proceedings could be taken out of context and be abused creating misrepresentations of the court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

David Woods</a> [official profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/guantanamo-commander-defends-policy-of-reading-prisoner-mail.php">testified</a> [JURIST report] that the policy balances his responsibilities to facilitate attorney-client communication while also ensuring security, safety, guard protection and good order at the facility.

The OHCHR sets out guidelines for the treatment of prisoners through <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/a4f543b9dadd08a7c12563ed00487ed8?Opendocument">General Comment No. 9</a> [text], issued in 1982, which Incalcaterra notes should have been followed more closely in order to prevent the inhumane treatment that is believed to be linked to the violence.

Incalcaterra said in a statement: <blockquote>These events reflect an alarming pattern of prison violence in the region, which is a direct consequence of&#8212;or is aggravated by&#8212;among others, poor conditions of detention, including chronic prison overcrowding, the lack of access to basic services such as adequate floor space, potable water, food, health care, and lack of basic sanitary and hygienic standards.</blockquote>These types of conditions are addressed in both the OHCHR General Comment as well as the Optional Protocol.

The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-reintroduces-legislation-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">reintroduced</a> [JURIST report] to the <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ug/">Parliament of Uganda</a> [official website] on Tuesday in its original form, but Bahati stated that there were plans to remove certain provisions. Bahati said in 2010 that the purpose of the bill was to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYTziDqTWD4">prevent foreigners from corrupting Ugandan children</a> [YouTube video] by giving them money and convincing them to become homosexuals. Bahati stated that provisions imposing jail time for individuals married to someone of the same sex <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hs2B6OXHUeB1jav2vNkNrJqClzMQ?docId=CNG.5754c1297c4350e7f999b98ecde74982.2c1">would also be removed form the bill</a> [AFP report]. The original bill imposed the death penalty on homosexual "repeat offenders" and gay sex where one of the offenders is a minor or has HIV.

<p>Uganda faces an ongoing struggle with anti-gay sentiment in the country. In November the <a href="http://www.ulii.org/ug/cases/UGHC/">Ugandan High Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">sentenced a man to 30 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for beating to death prominent gay rights activist David Kato. In January 2011 the Ugandan High Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/uganda-high-court-rules-anti-gay-newspaper-article-violated-constitutional-rights.php">issued a permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] and awarded damages to three plaintiffs who were among 100 people alleged to be homosexuals by the Ugandan tabloid newspaper, <em>The Rolling Stone</em>. In January 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-proposed.php">criticized the original anti-gay legislation</a> [JURIST report], saying that it could harm Uganda's reputation internationally. In February 2010, US President Barack Obama and <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">publicly denounced the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST report].

Effectively, this bill would allow adoption agencies to refuse to adopt to same-sex couples. It has already been <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-lawmakers-approve-bill-allowing-adoption-agencies-to-refuse-placement.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the the <a href="http://legis.virginia.gov/1_home/gen_info_house.htmlhttp://legis.virginia.gov/1_home/gen_info_house.html">Virginia House of Delegates</a> [official website], and <a href="http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official profile] said he will sign the bill if it makes it to his desk. The bill provides, in relevant part: <blockquote>No private child-placing agency shall be required to consider or consent to any placement of a child for foster care or adoption when the proposed placement would conflict with the religious tenets of any sponsor of the agency or other organization or institution with which the child-placing agency is affiliated or associated. ... Refusal of a private child-placing agency to consider or consent to any placement of a child pursuant to this section shall not form the basis of any claim for damages.</blockquote>The <a href="http://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/">Virginia Board of Social Services</a> [official website] already adopted similar regulations in December. This legislation would prevent those regulations from being changed.

<p>Last month an <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/iowa-court-orders-both-same-sex-parents-be-included-on-birth-certificate.php">Iowa court ruled</a> [JURIST report] that both same-sex parents' names must be recorded on birth certificates. In October the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/supreme-court-asked-to-review-putting-gay-adoptive-parents-on-birth-certificate.php">denied certiorari</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/adar-v-smith">Adar v. Smith</a> [backgrounder], in which a same-sex couple asked Louisiana to include both of their names on the birth certificate of their adopted child. In April the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/arkansas-high-court-upholds-decision-to-strike-gay-adoption-ban.php">Arkansas Supreme Court struck down</a> [JURIST report] a state ban on adoptions by same-sex couples. The <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/mexico-high-court-upholds-mexico-city-same-sex-adoption-law.php">Supreme Court of Mexico in August 2010 upheld a Mexico City law</a> [JURIST report] allowing adoptions by same-sex couples. Two years before that, a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/florida-judge-rules-gay-adoption-ban.php">Florida court ruled that a state statute</a> [JURIST report] preventing same-sex couples from adopting children was unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

High Commissioner <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] is now scheduled to <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41200&Cr=syria&Cr1=">address the UN General Assembly</a> [UN News Centre report] on Monday regarding the latest humanitarian developments in Syria, where the ongoing uprising challenging the autocratic rule of President Bashar Assad has resulted in a bloody government crackdown that has seen more than 5,000 people killed since March. Reports of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/10/us-syria-un-idUSTRE8190SN20120210">increased violence in recent days</a> [Reuters report] prompted Pillay earlier this week to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-protection-of-syria-civilians.php">urge international intervention</a> [JURIST report] on behalf of the Syrian people. General Assembly President <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/president/66/about/">Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser</a> [official profile] then made a request for Pillay to brief the 193-member Assembly after she argued that the failure of the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to agree on collective action against Syria has encouraged the Syrian government to attack and kill civilians to quash dissent. The General Assembly also plans to discuss at the session a December report by the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-human-rights-council-condemns-violence-in-syria.php">strongly condemned the recent violence</a> [JURIST report], and upon which the Council passed an emergency resolution calling for the appointment of a special human rights investigator on Syria, the suspension of Syrian security forces suspected of human rights violations and the release of prisoners of conscience held by Syrian authorities. No other UN bodies have acted on the resolution.

<p>The OHCHR has consistently called for an end to the violence in Syria and ICC prosecution of Syrian officials. Pillay has <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-again-urges-security-council-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">addressed the UN Security Council twice</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-refer-syria-conflict-to-icc-for-investigation.php">urge ICC prosecutions</a> [JURIST reports]. Human rights groups have also sharply criticized the Syrian government for using violence against its own people. Earlier this week the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] claimed that 11 months of violence in Syria has <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">led to the deaths of hundreds of children</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/hrw-syria-forces-torturing-children.php">accused the Syrian army of torturing children</a> [JURIST report]. In January, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC backgrounder] end violence against Syrian civilians. In November, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/syria-forces-committing-crimes-against-humanity-against-humanity-hrw.php">declared that Syrian forces were committing crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report], including torture and unlawful killings of anti-government protesters. JURIST contributing editor <a href="http://www.law.utah.edu/faculty/faculty-profile/?id=chibli-mallat">Chibli Mallat</a> argues that a UN Security Council resolution <a href="/forum/2012/02/chibli-mallat-syria.php">would not have affected meaningful change</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In this <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40899&Cr=South">organized attack</a> [UN News Centre report], thousands of armed Lou Nuer villagers invaded the Murle villages, robbing and burning houses and killing thousands of people. South Sudan's government has claimed repeatedly that <a href="http://www.goss.org/">it will investigate</a> [South Sudan government news reports] the attacks and punish those who are responsible, but HRW says that no progress has been made. "For speed and credibility's sake, the government should ask the UN and African bodies for help," Bekele said. Since the December attack, there have been <a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/UN-expresses-concerns-over,41314">retaliation attacks</a> [<em>Sudan Tribune</em> report] made by Murles, and <a href="http://www.southsudannewsagency.com/news/press-releases/nuer-and-dinka-white-army-to-launch-operation-savannah-storm-against-murle-armed-youth">threats of another full-scale attack</a> [press release] by the Lou Nuers have been made.

It is only recently that these raids have become as organized and deadly as the December Lou Nuer attack.

In November 2010, a Croatian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/croatia-court-sentences-6-men-for-2008-death-of-journalist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six men to 15 to 40 years in prison for their roles in the 2008 killing of a Croatian journalist. In 2008, AI called on the EU to use Croatia's status as a candidate country to ensure that the Croatian government <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/eu-urged-to-ensure-croat-war-criminals.php">actively investigates and prosecutes</a> [JURIST report] suspected war criminals. AI criticized the slow pace of war crimes investigations, and noted that Croatian courts have mostly focused on crimes allegedly committed by ethnic Serbs even though Croats have also been accused of ethnic-based war crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court's refusal means that the appeals court's <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/Order-Texas%20Medical%20Providers%20Performing%20Abortion%20Services%20v.%20Lakey%20.pdf">original decision</a> [opinion, PDF] that the law is enforceable will stand. The <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/82R/billtext/pdf/HB00015F.pdf#navpanes=0">Texas law</a> [HB 15, PDF] has been controversial because it requires doctors to describe the details of the sonogram to the woman and also let her hear the fetal heartbeat, regardless of whether she refuses. The CRR <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/crr-files-lawsuit-challenging-texas-abortion-sonogram-law">originally filed suit</a> [press release] in June 2011 on the basis that the law violates women's basic reproductive rights and doctors' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] right against compelled speech.

<p>A District Court judge ruled last week that Texas can <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-law.php">begin to enforce the law</a> [JURIST report] immediately, while criticizing the Appeals Court's decision on the grounds that it infringed upon First Amendment rights of doctors. Texas Governor Rick Perry <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">signed the measure into law</a> in May, but it was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-blocks-key-provisions-of-texas-abortion-law.php">blocked</a> in August after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/reproductive-rights-group-challenges-texas-sonogram-before-abortion-law.php">challenge</a> [JURIST reports] from the CRR. Laws similar to the Texas law have also been considered in other states. Early this month, the Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound before the procedure. In October, a judge for the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Spokesperson for the OHCHR, Rupert Colville, indicated that <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41202&Cr=judges&Cr1=">judges should not be criminally charged for investigations</a> [UN report] performed within the scope of their judicial duties.  Colville stated, "judges should not be subject to criminal prosecution for doing their job...Spain is obliged under international law to investigate past serious human rights violations, including those committed during the Franco regime, and to prosecute and punish those responsible." Garzon is on trial on charges of exceeding his jurisdiction by investigating complaints he received that, if true, would constitute crimes against humanity occurring under the rule of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5192228.stm">Francisco Franco</a> [BBC backgrounder] between 1936 and 1951. The investigations and rulings by Garzon are argued to be illegal because of amnesty laws limiting the statute of limitations for bringing claims of human rights violations during the Franco regime. Colville also reminded Spain of a OHCHR recommendation given in 2009 to reform its amnesty law, arguing that its law was not in accordance with international human rights law. 

<p>Last month, Garzon took the stand to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-judge-garzon-defends-franco-era-probes.php">defend his actions</a> [JURIST report] in ordering the probe into crimes committed under Franco. Garzon <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/31/world/europe/spain-judge-trial/?hpt=wo_c2">refused to answer questions</a> [CNN report] posed to him by the prosecution but did answer questions from his defense lawyer. He denied that his investigation was politically motivated, and stated that he was seeking justice for the victims of the alleged crimes. Garzon also rejected the idea that a 1977 amnesty law covers widespread human rights abuses. Garzon's testimony was consistent with his previous <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/spain-judge-garzon-defends-2008-franco.php">statements defending</a> [JURIST report] the validity of the investigation by insisting that he acted within the bounds of the law and appropriately applied the law at all times. Last March, Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/spain-judge-garzon-petitions-europe-rights-court-over-franco-probe.php">filed a petition</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website], challenging the 2010 abuse of power charges, for which he was <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/spain-judicial-panel-suspends-judge-garzon-over-franco-probe.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report]. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Garzon was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/spain-high-court-convicts-judge-garzon-in-wire-tapping-case.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] on Thursday by the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder_Judicial/Tribunal_Supremo">Spanish Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on charges of approving illegal wire taps, and was given an eleven year suspension from the judiciary. He is still awaiting a third trial on bribery charges over money he received for seminars conducted in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Motorola's suit in Germany is over patent no. <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,359,898.PN.&OS=PN/6,359,898&RS=PN/6,359,898">6,359,898</a> [text]. Apple contends that Motorola's German suit <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/10/us-apple-motorola-lawsuit-idUSTRE8191SV20120210">violates a licensing agreement between Motorola and Qualcomm</a> [Reuters report]. Apple argues that as a customer of Qualcomm it is a third-party beneficiary of the licensing agreement, thus Motorola's right to assert patent claims is <a href="http://www.theiplawblog.com/archives/-patent-law-patent-exhaustion-clarified.html">exhausted</a> [<em>The IP Law blog</em> backgrounder]. In the suit, Apple argues that Motorola, which is set to be acquired by <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/about/corporate/index.html">Google</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GOOG:US">backgrounder</a>], is <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/02/a-riveting-read-apple-files-a-complaint-for-declaratory-and-injunctive-relief-against-motorola.html">violating its promise</a> [<em>Patently Apple</em> report] to license essential patents on "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory" terms and is attempting to halt sales of the iPhone 4S. Many commentators have <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/02/08/harvey-harvey-harvey-dent/">expressed concern</a> [<em>Pando Daily</em> report] over Google's acquisition of Motorola's vast patent portfolio, which includes patent on 4G and 3G technologies, but Google has made assurances that it will license its patents fairly and cap licensing fees at 2.25% of the sale price of each phone.

<p>Apple is involved in litigation all over the world over smart phones and related technology. In December the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (USITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-trade-commission-rules-narrowly-for-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">narrowly ruled for Apple</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=4">HTC</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2498:TT">backgrounder</a>]. Earlier that month, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html">European Commission for Competition</a> [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/eu-antitrust-commission-to-investigate-apple-e-book-dealings.php">open an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into whether Apple colluded with publishers to increase the price of e-books. Also in December, the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-denies-injuction-request-by-apple-in-samsung-patent-case.php">declined to issue a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/#latest-home">Samsung Electronics</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SMSN:IX">backgrounder</a>], as requested by Apple in its suit over Samsung's "Galaxy" line of products.

The Montana Supreme Court stated that the ban on corporate spending is legal because it still allows for some corporate spending and was in response to rampant political corruption by the <a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers6/copperkings.html">"Copper Kings"</a> [<em>Great Falls Tribune</em> backgrounder]. Specifically, the law allows corporations to set up Political Action Committees (PACs) to fund political speech, but PACs are subject to special state disclosure and reporting laws.

<p><a href="/currentawareness/campaignfinance.php">Campaign finance</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a hotly contested issue recently. Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-wisconsin-campaign-finance-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a Wisconsin law that prohibited people from donating more than $10,000 per year to political action committees. In June, the US Supreme Court ruled that an Arizona campaign finance regulation <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-Arizona-campaign-finance-restriction.php">violated the First Amendment</a> [JURIST report]. In May, the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-minnesota-campaign-finance-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a Minnesota law that prohibited direct contributions to candidates and affiliated entities. The <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] ruled in 2009 that a Connecticut campaign finance law <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/federal-court-rules-connecticut.php">discriminated against minor party candidates</a> [JURIST report] in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>

In a 4-1 vote the NRC approved an application by <a href="http://www.southerncompany.com/">Southern Company</a> [corporate website] for an issuance of two Combined Construction and Operating Licenses (COL), the first such licenses ever approved for a US nuclear plant. The lone dissenting vote was cast by NRC <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/commission/jaczko.html">Chairman Gregory Jaczko</a> [official profile], who cited environmental concerns similar to those surrounding the fallout from the March 2011 <a href="http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/tsunamiupdate01.html">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster</a> [IAEA backgrounder]. Each COL authorizes a new reactor unit at the Waynesboro, GA, <a href="http://www.southerncompany.com/nuclearenergy/vogtle.aspx">Vogtle Electric Generating Plant</a> [corporate website], which began commercial operation of its two existing reactors in the late 1980s. Following the NRC vote the Georgia <a href="http://www.psc.state.ga.us/">Public Service Commission</a> (PSC) [official website] unanimously approved the costs projected by Southern subsidiary <a href="http://www.georgiapower.com/">Georgia Power</a> [corporate website; <a href="http://southerncompany.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=2493">press release</a>], whose construction costs for the new Vogtle units are monitored by the PSC via monthly filings and semiannual construction monitoring reports. No nuclear power plants have been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/09/us-usa-nuclear-license-idUSTRE8181T420120209">licensed in the US</a> [Reuters report] since the partial meltdown of the reactor core of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979. Georgia Power hopes to have Vogtle Units 3 and 4 running by 2016 and 2017 respectively.

<p>International reception to nuclear energy has fallen sharply since the the Fukushima disaster. The incident is now considered one of the biggest man-made environmental disasters of all time and the largest nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. In September Laura Frano, a certified legal intern at the <a href="http://www.law.pitt.edu/academics/juris-doctor/clinics/environmental">University of Pittsburgh Environmental Law Clinic</a>, wrote about the <a href="/dateline/2011/09/laura-frano-environmental-law.php">growing popularity of natural gas</a> [JURIST commentary] and other energy sources in the wake of environmental catastrophes like Fukushima and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=BP+oil+spill">BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a> [JURIST news archive]. In July the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] dismissed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-to-force-nuclear-waste-storage-at-yucca-mountain.php">lawsuit to force nuclear waste storage</a> [JURIST report] at Yucca Mountain. In May the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] upheld the NRC decision to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-appeals-court-upholds-renewal-license-for-oldest-nuclear-plant.php">renew the license of the oldest US nuclear plant</a> [JURIST report]. Nevertheless the Fukushima incident has sparked ongoing concern over nuclear policies and their affect on the environment, as Tamar Cerafici of the Cerafici Law Firm noted in April in her <a href = "/forum/2011/04/fukushima-illustrates-need-for-policy.php">call for a coherent US energy policy</a> [JURIST op-ed] that pays more than a begrudging acceptance of nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Michael Archuleta, 49, was convicted in 1989 of first-degree murder for the beating death of a college student, and is now <a href="http://media.bonnint.net/slc/2496/249664/24966491.pdf">set to be executed by firing squad</a> [order, PDF] on April 5. <a href="http://www.utcourts.gov/judgesbios/showGallery.asp?dist=4&ct_type=D#2788">Judge Donald Eyre Jr.</a> [official profile] issued the execution warrant under a Utah <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE77/htm/77_18_000505.htm">statute</a> [text] that sets "lethal intravenous injection" as the official method of execution, unless "a court holds that a defendant has a right to be executed by a firing squad, [in which case] the method of execution for that defendant shall be a firing squad." The exemption applies to death row inmates like Archuleta who had already requested a firing squad when they were abolished by statute in 2004. The decision to honor Archuleta's request was likely made to avoid further execution delays that could result from an ongoing shortage of lethal injection drugs, created last year when the main US manufacturer ceased production of a key anesthetic used in the three-drug "cocktail" that makes up a lethal injection. If the execution is carried out, Archuleta will be the fourth prisoner to be put to death by firing squad since the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] reinstated <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/death.php">capital punishment</a> [JURIST news archive] in 1976. Each of the other three firing squad executions also took place in Utah.

<p>The last person to be executed by firing squad was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10254279">Ronnie Lee Gardner</a> [BBC backgrounder], who was <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/utah-convict-executed-by-firing-squad.php">put to death</a> [JURIST report] in June 2010 after the US Supreme Court failed to stay his execution. Utah's allowance of execution by firing squad has added to general criticism of the death penalty, which is used in 34 states. Earlier this month Crystal Whalen, a student attorney at the Regional Public Defender's Office for Capital Cases in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in favor of moving away from the death penalty, arguing that <a href="/dateline/2012/02/crystal-whalen-death-penalty.php">death as punishment is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST commentary] under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt8_user.html#amdt8_hd4">Eighth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. In March 2011, Illinois <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">voted to abolish the death penalty entirely</a> [JURIST report]. Two years before that, <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/new-mexico-governor-signs-bill.php">New Mexico repealed</a> [JURIST report] the use of the death penalty in the state, replacing it with a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. New Mexico was the third state to abolish the death penalty since 1976, joining <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill.php">New Jersey</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/new-york-appeals-court-upholds.php">New York</a> [JURIST reports], each of which abolished the death penalty in 2007.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Malaysia national spokesman Ramli Yoosuf announced that Hamza Kashgari, 23, was <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_MALAYSIA_SAUDI_DETAINED?SITE=CAVIC&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">flown back to Saudi Arabia</a> [AP report] under a warrant for arrest issued Monday by Saudi authorities. A lawyer appointed by Kashgari's family has stated that the move was unlawful because he had previously obtained a court order to block deportation. Kashgari faces charges of blasphemy, a crime punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. Kashgari was threatened with death penalty charges after making anti-Muhammad comments on Twitter on Muhammad's birthday last Saturday. Kashgari has since deleted the Tweets and apologized, but that did not stop the public uproar against him. He was <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/02/10/malaysia-saudi-blogger-idINDEE81902W20120210">arrested upon his arrival</a> [Reuters report] in Malaysia Thursday as part of an <a href="http://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a> [official website] operation between Saudi and Malaysian police officials. Although the two countries have good relations, Malaysia does not have a specific agreement with Saudi Arabia that would have obligated Kashgari's deportation.

<p>Last month the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] criticized Saudi Arabia for its <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-criticizes-increased-use-of-capital-punishment-in-saudi-arabia.php">increased use of the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], which has tripled since 2010. Human rights groups such as <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites] have also criticized the country for <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-group-urges-stop-to-saudi-executions.php">cruel punishment</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/saudi-arabia-urged-to-improve-domestic.php">lack of human rights protections</a> [JURIST reports]. Malaysia has been recently <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/malaysia-bill-will-curb-peaceful-assembly-rights-un-experts.php">criticized by the UN</a> [JURIST report] for taking steps away from protecting its citizens' rights to freedom of expression, although in Malaysia blasphemy is not punishable by death. Both <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/death-penalty-fear-tweeter-facing-forcible-return-saudi-arabia-malaysia-201">AI</a> and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/10/malaysia-don-t-send-saudi-back">HRW</a> [press releases] urged Malaysia not to deport Kashgari.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/uploads/bideford-judgment-final.pdf">judgment</a> [opinion, PDF] followed a Judicial Review initiated by the <a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/">National Secular Society</a> (NSS) [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/news/2012/02/council-prayers-unlawful-rules-high-court">press release</a>] to challenge the practice of prayers as part of the formal business of council meetings, attendance at which is mandatory for local councillors. Even though prayer was conducted at meetings before attendance was taken, with councillors told they could abstain from such portions of meetings, the prayer was included in the formal list of items sent to councillors when they were summoned, and was included in the meeting minutes later sent out. Justice Ouseley wrote for the High Court:<blockquote>The duties of Parish councillors and the way in which a Parish Council must conduct its business are laid down in the Local Government Act 1972 ... There is no specific statutory power to say prayers or to have any period of quiet reflection as part of the business of the Council ... Accordingly, I have come to the view that the Council has no power to hold prayers as part of a formal Council meeting, or to summon Councillors to a meeting at which such prayers are on the agenda.</blockquote> Ouseley rejected the Council's argument for statutory authority&#8212;that it may conduct other "functions" not specifically listed in the Local Government Act&#8212;on the basis that prayer is not a "function" under the Act. Ouseley made clear that his ruling does not affect whether Councillors can hold prayer before meetings, but to conduct it at the formal beginning of meetings is not allowed. Ouseley also ruled that if the practice were lawful, that under the law "the manner in which the practice is carried out in the circumstances of Bideford does not infringe" on individual human rights, nor does it unlawfully discriminate on the grounds of an individual's lack of religious belief.

<p>NSS is a British organization committed to promoting separation of church and state. It brought the action against the Bideford Town Council after atheist Council member Clive Bone complained about the prayer. Although NSS was pleased with the judgment, some Christian groups have questioned what its effects will be. <a href="http://www.christian.org.uk/">Christian Institute</a> [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.christian.org.uk/news/court-bans-prayers-at-formal-council-meetings/">press release</a>] spokesman Simon Calvert noted his group "welcome[s] the finding that the saying of prayers isn't discriminatory, or a breach of equality laws, or human rights laws." He believes the ruling was purely based on statutory construction, not on whether the prayer infringes on rights, so that an amendment or passage of a new law could make prayer at meetings lawful. Last month the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-county-board-meeting-prayers.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] a case concerning whether a county board of commissioners in North Carolina violated the Establishment Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1afrag1_user.html#amdt1a_hd4">First Amendment</a> [LII backgrounder] by opening their public meetings with prayers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Gilani appeared before the court and pleaded not guilty, saying he will fight the charges. The Supreme Court claims Gilani <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17008521">defied a court order</a> [BBC report] to ask Swiss authorities to re-open cases against Zardari. Gilani has maintained that charges against President Zardari are politically motivated and the president has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2012/02/201221344753846407.html">immunity as the head of state</a> [Al Jazeera report]. If he is convicted of contempt Gilani could <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-pm-appeals-high-court-summons-in-contempt-case.php">lose his public office</a> [JURIST report] and be sent to prison for up to six months. This is only the second time that contempt charges have been filed against a sitting prime minister in Pakistan's history. The next session is set to take place on February 22.

<p>The Supreme Court issued a summons two weeks ago <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/pakistan-high-court-orders-pm-to-appear-on-contempt-charges.php">demanding Gilani appear</a> [JURIST report] at Monday's contempt hearing. Last month, Gilani honored <a href="paperchase/2012/01/pakistan-high-court-begins-contempt-proceedings-against-pm.php">previously issued summons</a> by appearing before the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/pakistan-high-court-gives-pm-two-weeks-to-prepare-defense-to-contempt-proceedings.php">answer contempt charges</a> [JURIST reports] and explain why he failed to purse corruption charges against President Zardari, who is accused of using Swiss bank accounts to fund bribes. The conflict between the prime minister and the court stems from an order that <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/pakistan-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/2007/NationalReconciliationOrdinance.html">National Reconciliation Ordinance</a> (NRO) [text] in 2009, which granted immunity to Zardari and 8,000 other government officials from charges of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder and terrorism between January 1986 and October 1999. These proceedings reflect an ongoing struggle between the government and the courts in Pakistan. In December, the Supreme Court formed a judicial committee to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/pakistan-supreme-court-to-investigate-memo-scandal.php">investigate a secret memo</a> [JURIST report] sent from an unknown Pakistani source to US Admiral Mike Mullen in May asking for help in preventing a suspected army coup.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Protesters clashed with police outside parliament after the vote, looting and burning buildings in reaction to the new budget measures that will eliminate public sector jobs and lower wages and pension plans. <a href="http://www.primeminister.gov.gr/english/lucas-papademos/">Prime Minister Lucas Papademos</a> [official profile] denounced the violence, regarded as the worst since 2008, which continued into Monday. Papademos had <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/12/us-greece-idUSTRE8120HI20120212">warned</a> [Reuters report] that rejecting the package would jeopardize Greece's standing in the European community. Finance ministers from euro-based countries, who previously demanded that Greece pass budget cuts, will meet this week to decide whether to approve a second aid package for the country.

Washington had previously granted <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/washington-voters-approve-expanded.php">expanded domestic partnership rights</a> [JURIST report] rather than full marriage or civil union rights to same-sex couples. Gregoire's signature completed a campaign for marriage rights that started in 2006. Gregoire, a strong personal advocate of same-sex marriage, <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/news/news-view.asp?pressRelease=1854&newsType=1">stated</a> [press release] after signing: <blockquote>As governor for more than seven years, this is one of my proudest moments. And most surely today is a proud day in the history of the Legislature and the state of Washington. It is a day historians will mark as a milestone for equal rights. A day when we did what was right, we did what was just, and we did what was fair. We stood up for equality and we did it together- Republicans and Democrats, gay and straight, young and old, and a variety of religious faiths. I'm proud of who and what we are in this state.</blockquote>Opponents of same-sex marriage have promised to challenge the imminent law with a referendum, similar to <a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/past/2008/general/text-proposed-laws/text-of-proposed-laws.pdf">Proposition 8</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=proposition+8">news archive</a>] in California. The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] earlier this week that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional. If a ballot initiative in Washington is not achieved, same-sex marriages could begin as early as June.

<p>The Washington state House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-house-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved</a> the bill to legalize same-sex marriage last Thursday while the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-senate-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">Senate passed the bill</a> [JURIST reports] two weeks ago. New Jersey is also considering legalizing same-sex marriage soon, although it currently has a civil union system in place. In November, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the New Jersey State Constitution. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].

Nine members of the militia were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/militia-members-indicted-for-plotting.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in March 2010 on charges of seditious conspiracy, attempted use of weapons of mass destruction, teaching the use of explosive materials, and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence in connection with a plan to kill Michigan law enforcement officers. Lawyers for the Hutaree militia maintain that the anti-government statements made by militant members were <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2100351/Hutaree-militia-trial-Court-decide-fate-anti-government-militia-members.html">not serious threats</a> [AP report] and were made only in frustration. The government maintains that the Hutaree militia's primary aim was to fight law enforcement authorities who belonged to the "New World Order". One of the nine militia members charged has already agreed to plead guilty, while another is set for a separate trial. 

<p>In May 2010, federal Judge Victoria Roberts granted bail for the nine members of the group. Roberts ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-grants-bail-for.php">bail would be granted</a> [JURIST report] but that the eight men and one woman must relinquish weapons and weapons permits, remain confined to their homes, and be kept under electronic surveillance. The group members allegedly planned to kill [AP report] Michigan law enforcement officers by, among other methods, making phony 911 calls and ambushing those who responded. There is some evidence that right-wing nativist and so-called "patriot" anti-government militias such as the Hutaree are on the rise in the US. A 2009 report by the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) [advocacy website] noted that these groups are <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/anti-government-militias-growing-in-us.php">making a comeback</a> [JURIST report] after declining for a number of years. The SPLC said that such groups are generally anti-tax, anti-immigration, and increasingly racially motivated since the election of the country&#39;s first African-American president, Barack Obama. The SPLC also warned that these groups could soon pose a security risk to the country, quoting one official as saying "[a]ll it's lacking is a spark. I think it's only a matter of time before you see threats and violence."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The smartphone uses Google's newest version of <a href = "http://www.android.com/">Android</a> [official website] called Ice Cream Sandwich, which Apple alleges <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/02/10/apple_lodges_new_suit_against_samsung_over_autocorrect_screen_unlock.html">infringe on four patents</a> [Apple Insider report] held by Apple. The patents describe features that allow users to search by using a <a href = "http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8086604.html">voice command</a>, slide an image to <a href = "http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8046721.html">unlock</a> the phone, an <a href = "http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8074172.html">autocorrect</a> function for typing and the <a href = "http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5946647.html">structure</a> [patent texts] of the operating system (OS). The Galaxy Nexus is the first phone to use Ice Cream Sandwich, the newest version of popular smartphone OS Android. Samsung acknowledged the lawsuit on Monday and stated that they will continue to defend against Apple's intellecutal property suits. It is unsure when the injunction request will be ruled on.

<p>Apple brought a different claim against Samsung last year in the same court alleging that Samsung copied certain features and used similar icons to the iPhone and iPad. In December, District Judge Lucy Koh ruled against Apple and <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-denies-injuction-request-by-apple-in-samsung-patent-case.php">declined to issue a preliminary injunction</a> against Apple in its first claim against Samsung. Apple may still prevail on its claims, but needs to prove both infringement and validity. Apple has also been involved in other lawsuits with Android affiliated companies. In December the US International Trade Commission (USITC) <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-trade-commission-rules-narrowly-for-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">ruled for Apple</a> in its suit against HTC alleging patent infringements. In November the USITC found that Apple <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-trade-commission-clears-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">did not violate</a> four of HTC's patents. In July USITC ruled that HTC <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">infringed two Apple patents</a> [JURIST reports] relating to the Android operating system. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Conille said that one of the experts' goals would be to <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CB_HAITI_DUVALIER?SITE=KYB66&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">investigate a ruling</a> [AP report] involving former Haitian ruler <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/01/17/f-haiti-duvalier-bio.html">Jean-Claude Duvalier</a> [CBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=duvalier">news archive</a>]. The ruling, handed down two weeks ago, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-ex-president-duvalier-will-not-face-trial-for-rights-violations.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Duvalier will not face trial for crimes against humanity, including torture, rape and murder during his reign from 1971 to 1986. The ruling prompted an outcry from plaintiffs, as well as human rights groups, who have accused the Haitian government of influencing the judiciary. Though Haitian <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/michel_martelly/index.html">President Michel Martelly</a> [NYT profile] has denied any involvement with the Duvalier case, Conille requested that the DOS's experts investigate the possibility of a corrupted ruling and help strengthen the judiciary, emphasizing the need for the courts to inspire confidence in the Haitian people.

<p>The rule of law in Haiti has been a contentious issue recently. Last week, UN independent expert Michel Forst proclaimed that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/haiti-rule-of-law-has-made-significant-progress-un-expert.php">rule of law is making significant progress in Haiti</a> [JURIST report]. Forst focused on the establishment of judicial offices and the adoption of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCIQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.unhcr.org%2Frefworld%2Fdocid%2F3ae6b36c0.html&ei=xAU0T_LNMMLY0QHa483OAg&usg=AFQjCNGqn6yd6Ue2X7LUfI9Kx3l6suaZEg&sig2=YW1qtZx2uNc4Bl80X5hHOw">International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights</a> [text, PDF]. In January, a Haitian judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/haiti-judge-convicts-8-police-officers-for-post-earthquake-prison-shooting.php">convicted eight police officers</a> [JURIST report] of shooting and killing at least ten prisoners following the January 2010 earthquake. In December, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-groups-urge-probe-of-torture-and-killings-by-haiti-police.php">urged an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into alleged torture and unlawful killings perpetrated by the <a href="http://www.policenationalehaiti.org/welcome.php?page_id=32">Haitian National Police</a> (HNP) [official website, in French].

Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. She emphasized that the international community needed to hold Syrian officials accountable for their alleged human rights abuses: <blockquote>The Fact-Finding Mission, the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, and I myself have all concluded that crimes against humanity are likely to have been committed in Syria. I have encouraged the Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court. All Member States must ensure that these crimes do not go unpunished. The Universal Declaration for Human Rights, adopted by this Assembly more than 60 years ago, makes clear that it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law. The people of Syria are asking for the rights that every human being is entitled to.</blockquote> Pillay cited reports indicating that Syrian security forces have killed more than 5,400 people since violence between President Bashar al-Assad's government and anti-government protesters began eleven months ago.

<p>Pillay, as well as numerous human rights groups, have called for both an end to violence in Syria and ICC prosecution of Syrian officials. On Friday, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-office-calls-for-icc-trial-for-syria-officials.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that Syrian officials suspected of crimes against humanity be tried before the ICC. Pillay has <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-again-urges-security-council-to-refer-syria-to-icc.php">addressed the UN Security Council</a> twice to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-refer-syria-conflict-to-icc-for-investigation.php">urge ICC prosecutions</a> [JURIST reports]. Last week the <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] claimed that 11 months of violence in Syria has <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">led to the deaths of hundreds of children</a> [JURIST report].

As chairman of the Yuanhua Group in Xiamen, Lai <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/02/13/china-crime-idINDEE81C0CZ20120213">allegedly smuggled</a> [Reuters report] billions of dollars worth of various goods including cigarettes and cars, as well as oil and other chemicals. In order to smuggle the goods through Chinese customs, Lai allegedly bribed government officials with significant amounts of money. More than 200 senior government officials have been implicated in the smuggling ring. The date of trial is still unknown, but if Lai is convicted the Chinese government has indicated that he will face life imprisonment rather than the death penalty. According to state-run media reports, Lai has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2012-02/13/c_131407501.htm">confessed to all charges</a> [Xinhua report] against him.

<p>Lai fled to Canada with his ex-wife and three children in 1999, when the charges were first brought against him. He was able to obtain refugee protection from the Chinese judiciary system, which allowed the death penalty for his alleged crimes. In 2006, Canada <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/canada-court-stays-deportation-of-top.php">stayed Lai's deportation</a> [JURIST report] based on claims that he would face torture and execution if compelled to return to China.

The court <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE81D07V20120214">dismissed the charges</a> [Reuters report] after determining that al-Mahmoudi had lawfully crossed into Tunisia from Libya. Al-Mahmoudi's lawyer has indicated that he is attempting to have him released from custody while awaiting the extradition process. This decision comes following negotiations between the Tunisian interim government, led by <a href="http://www.moncefmarzouki.com/">President Moncef Marzouki</a> [official website, in Arabic], and the Libyan <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] concerning the circumstances of extraditing al-Mahmoudi back to Libya. Marzouki has stated that the approval of the extradition would depend on adequate reassurances from Libya that al-Mahmoudi would be treated humanely if transferred to Libyan custody. The decision also comes despite several human rights groups arguing against the former prime minister's extradition.

<p>In January, the <a href="http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/taxonomy/term/597">Tunisian League for the Defense of Human Rights</a>, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>, and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites], among other human rights groups, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/rights-groups-urge-tunisia-not-to-extradite-former-libya-pm.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Tunisia not to extradite al-Mahmoudi because he would be "at a real risk for torture" if returned to Libya. At the time, reports indicated that al-Mahmoudi <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">feared for his safety</a> and claimed to be the sole possessor of Libyan state secrets following Gaddafi's <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">death</a> in October [JURIST reports]. Some commentators have argued that former African leaders accused of human rights violations should be <a href="/forum/2011/09/charles-adeogun-phillips-libya.php">tried in their home countries</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Tunisia <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-court-orders-extradition-of-former-libya-pm.php">ordered al-Mahmoudi's extradition</a> in November, prompting a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/hrw-warns-against-extradition-of-former-libya-pm.php">response from HRW</a> [JURIST reports]. Al-Mamoudi was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-ex-pm-arrested-in-tunisia.php">arrested in Tunisia</a> in September 2011, and his extradition is one of many legal episodes within the ongoing effort by Libyan and international courts to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/tunisia-courts-to-review-extradition-of-ex-libya-prime-minister.php">investigate officials</a> [JURIST reports] in the former Gaddafi regime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsame-sex.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/Default.asp">New Jersey Senate</a> [official website] on Monday voted 24-16 to approve the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A0500/1_I1.PDF">Marriage Equality and Religious Exemption Act</a> [text, PDF], a bill which, if enacted, would legalize <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in the state. Under the bill, marriage would be defined as the "legally recognized union of two consenting persons in a committed relationship." The legislation would not require any member of the clergy or religious institution to perform same-sex marriages, or provide space for same-sex marriage services. The bill would also effectively end the state's current civil union system, with all partners currently in civil unions being deemed married. The NJ State Assembly is expected to vote on the bill Thursday, and if it is approved the legislation will move to <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] for his signature or veto. Christie has indicated that he <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/02/14/nj-senates-approval-of-same-sex-marriage-sets-up-fight-with-christie/">plans to veto the bill</a> [WSJ report], suggesting that the same-sex marriage issue should be put on the ballot for New Jersey citizens to decide. Senate <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?leg=216">President Stephen Sweeney</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/nj_senates_gay_marriage_approv.html">expressed confidence</a> [<em>Star-Ledger</em> report] in being able to override a veto by Christie, and rejected the idea of a public referendum on a civil rights issue. In order to override such a veto, 27 votes will be needed in the Senate and 54 votes in the Assembly. 

<p>The approval of the bill by the NJ Senate marks a shift on the issue of same-sex marriage in the state from last year, when a similar bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-senate-defeats-same-sex.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] in the Senate. In November, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the New Jersey State Constitution. On Monday, Washington <a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/">Governor Christine Gregoire</a> [official website] signed <a href="http://dlr.leg.wa.gov/billsummary/farbs.aspx?bill=6239&star=6239-S&biennium=21">legislation</a> [HB 6239] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">legalizing same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report], and making Washington the eighth jurisdiction in the US to offer marriage to same-sex couples. Same-sex marriage has previously been legalized in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports]. The case for same-sex marriage was recently made by JURIST contributor <a href="/staff/#kimberly">Kimberly Bennett</a> in <a href="/dateline/2012/01/kimberly-bennett-gay-rights.php">Judicial Activism and the Recognition of Same-Sex Marriage</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontaffirmativeaction.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday heard oral arguments from minority student advocates who urged the court to reconsider California's voter-approved ban on affirmative action based on race or gender preferences in education and state hiring. The ban, <a href="http://vote96.sos.ca.gov/Vote96/html/BP/209text.htm">Proposition 209</a> [text], has been upheld by California courts as a race-neutral measure. Though the measure bars state and local agencies from considering race or gender in employment, contracting, and education, 55 applicants to the University of California (UC) schools of higher education and the <a href="http://www.bamn.com/">Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</a> (CDAA) [advocacy website] brought this lawsuit to challenge only the higher education element. The students and CDAA claim that <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_19954540">affirmative action is needed</a> [<em>Mercury News</em> report] to increase racial diversity at UC campuses and professional schools, and that data shows that UC's efforts to enroll diverse student populations without considering race have failed. On the other hand, Ralph Kasarda, who is defending Proposition 209 on behalf of the university system, argued that the lawsuit is "redundant and baseless," and that the measure "guarantees everyone's right to be treated fairly and not be discriminated against based on skin color or gender."

<p>In October 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/california-governor-vetoes-bill-affirmative-action-bill.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report; veto <a href="http://gov.ca.gov/docs/SB_185_Veto_Message.pdf">text</a>, PDF] a <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0151-0200/sb_185_bill_20110902_enrolled.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would have effectively overturned Proposition 209 by allowing UC schools to consider demographic factors such as race during the admissions process. The Governor said in his veto message to the Senate that although he agreed with the bill's purpose, it is the role of the Ninth Circuit to decide Proposition 209's boundaries. Governor Brown previously <a href="http://equaljusticesociety.org/email/AG_LetterBrief_209_20090422.pdf">contested</a> [opinion letter, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/california-ag-calls-amendment-banning.php">report</a>] Proposition 209 in 2009 as California's Attorney General. The CDAA's suit was originally dismissed in December 2010 by the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a><br />

Justice Anne Molloy ruled in the case of Leroy Smickle, who was convicted of possessing a loaded handgun. The Canadian government <a href = "http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec95">stipulates</a> [95(1) of the Criminal Code text] that any party found guilty of that crime shall be sentenced to a minimum imprisonment of three years. Molloy found no malicious intent in Smickle's actions, and recognized that this conviction was his first as a mitigating factor. Smickle's defense counsel argued that the mandatory sentence amounted to cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/charter/page-1.html">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> [text], Canada's constitution, and Molloy agreed:<blockquote>The only goal or principle of sentencing that would arguably be met by the imposition of this sentence would be denunciation and general deterrence. However, the case law is clear that general deterrence alone cannot justify the imposition of a sentence that is otherwise grossly disproportionate to what an offender deserves. To take that principle to the extreme, a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for shoplifting would no doubt act as a general deterrent, but it would shock the public conscience to impose such an onerous punishment, for example, on a young single mother with no criminal record who steals a loaf of bread from Walmart.</blockquote>The results of this case, and recent case <a href="http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?text=nur&language=en&searchTitle=Search+all+CanLII+Databases&path=/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc4874/2011onsc4874.html">Regina v. Nur</a> [text], where a similar sentence was upheld, have combined to present a significant challenge to Canada's current mandatory minimum sentence requirements. The issue <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/in-a-challenge-to-ottawa-judge-refuses-to-impose-mandatory-sentence/article2336816/">may warrant an appeal</a> [<em>The Globe and Mail</em> report] to the <a href = "http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website]. 

<p>Mandatory minimum sentences have also been and issue in the United States, where the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-rules-on-mandatory-minimum-sentencing-for-federal-gun-crimes.php">issued a ruling</a> [JURIST report] in May of 2010 allowing mandatory minimums but elevating the standards of proof required in federal gun crimes. Some commentators have <a href="/hotline/2010/03/mandatory-minimum-sentencing-busts.php">suggested</a> [JURIST op-ed] that mandatory minimum sentences should also be disfavored because of their tendency to increase the load of prisons on governmental budgets and unnecessarily increase the non-violent prisoner population.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc-conflict.htm">Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict of the Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> [text] seeks to prevent children from taking part in conflicts. In a statement timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Optional Protocol, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict Radhika Coomaraswamy, pleaded that all states must ratify the Protocol: "Every country, big or small, with or without a standing army, at peace or in conflict, has a role to play in abolishing the inhumane practice of recruiting and using children in war." The treaty protocol has already been ratified by about three quarters of UN member states and needs ratification in an additional 49 states to make the protocol universal. 

<p>The problem of recruitment of <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=child+soldier">child soldiers</a> [JURIST news archives] is ongoing in many nations. In 2006, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/international-criminal-court-lays.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] Thomas Lubanga, founder of the militant Union of Patriotic Congolese, accusing him of enlisting child soldiers in the violence-plagued Ituri district of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). His trial began in January 2009 after <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/icc-reluctantly-stays-trial-of-congo-ex.php">being delayed for evidentiary reasons</a> and was halted soon after when one of the child witnesses <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/lubanga-war-crimes-trial-resumes-after.php">recanted his testimony</a> [JURIST reports] that Lubanga had recruited him for the militia. In August of last year, the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/icc-ends-first-war-crimes-trial.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] Lubanga's trial after two years. A verdict is expected in the case early this year. <br />

The bill passed <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+vot+HV0755+HB0001">66-32</a> [floor vote] moving the state toward banning <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive]. The bill, introduced by <a href="http://delegatebob.com/">Rep. Bob Marshall</a> (R) [official website], says: "Life of each human being begins at conception" and that "Unborn children have protectable interests in life, health, and well-being." The bill seeks to expand the rights of personhood under state law to unborn children at all stages development from conception:<blockquote>The laws of this Commonwealth shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this Commonwealth, subject only to the Constitution of the United States and decisional interpretations thereof by the United States Supreme Court and specific provisions to the contrary in the statutes and constitution of this Commonwealth.</blockquote> It will head to the Virginia Senate where it is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/14/us-virginia-personhood-idUSTRE81D1ZG20120214">unclear whether it will pass</a> [Reuters report]. With this bill, Virginia lawmakers are attempting to pass such legislation without running into the difficulty of amending the state constitution that has hindered similar attempts in other states. Constitutional amendments redefining personhood failed in both <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/colorado-voters-reject-anti-abortion-amendment.php">Colorado</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mississippi-voters-reject-personhood-amendment.php">Mississippi</a> [JURIST reports].

<p>The Virginia Senate recently approved legislation requiring a woman to have an <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">ultrasound before an abortion</a> [JURIST report]. Last November, Mississippi voters rejected a <a href="http://www.sos.ms.gov/page.aspx?s=7&s1=1&s2=50">ballot measure</a> [Initiative 26 materials] that would have amended the state constitution to define the word "person" or "persons" to include "every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the functional equivalent thereof." The initiative, which would have given fetuses rights from the moment of conception, was defeated by more than 55 percent of the state's voters. The primary goal of the legislation was an attempt to make abortion illegal on the theory that a woman's right to choose an abortion cannot outweigh the fetus' right to life. Colorado voters rejected a similar state constitutional amendment in November 2010. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://www.law.cuny.edu/faculty-staff/cborgmann.html">Caitlin Borgmann</a> [profile] argues that redefining personhood is just one of several approaches aimed at <a href="/forum/2011/05/caitlin-borgmann-constitutional-reproductive-rights.php">curtailing abortion</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new constitution reportedly <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/syria_hama_assault_/24484389.html">omits a clause</a> [RFE/RL report] in the old document that describes the ruling Ba'ath Party as the "leader of the nation and society." The expressed intent of that omission is to open the country up to a multiparty political system. The order for a referendum comes as the country is facing increasing unrest and violence in the wake of the government crackdown on protesters. Critics of Al-Assad's regime, including Shadi Hamid, director of research for the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/doha.aspx">Brookings Doha Center</a> [official website], have called the referendum insufficient. The referendum on the new constitution is set to take place on February 26. 

<p>The growing unrest in Syria has drawn copious international attention recently. Earlier this week, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, in a <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">speech to the UN General Assembly</a>, called for the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) claimed earlier in February that the past 11 months of violence in Syria have <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">led to the deaths of hundreds of children</a>. In January, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST reports] that al-Assad end violence against Syrian civilians. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

A similar bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/colorado-senate-passes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">passed in the Colorado Senate last year </a>[JURIST report], but was ultimately <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/01/us-colorado-gays-idUSTRE7306G720110401">defeated in the House</a> [Reuters report]. The bill received no sponsorship from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, and House Speaker Frank McNulty has voiced opposition. The Colorado constitution defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. 

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continue to occupy discussions among lawmakers and judges. On Tuesday the New Jersey Senate voted to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/nj-senate-votes-to-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">approve a bill</a> [JURIST report] that, if passed, would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">signed legislation</a>  [JURIST report] Monday legalizing same-sex marriage, making Washington the eighth jurisdiction in the US to offer marriage to same-sex couples. Earlier this month, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Proposition 8, California's ban on same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In January, an Iowa District Court ordered that the Iowa Department of Public Health <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/iowa-court-orders-both-same-sex-parents-be-included-on-birth-certificate.php">include both names</a> [JURIST report] of married same-sex parents on children's birth certificates.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge, US Army Colonel James Pohl, <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CB_GUANTANAMO_COLE_ATTACK_SALEH?SITE=TXWIC&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">did not give a rationale for his ruling</a> [AP report], saying only that he would explain his decision later. In January, the US <a href="www.state.gov">State Department</a> (DOS) [official website] <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/01/182494.htm">declared</a> [press release] that Saleh has diplomatic immunity despite his seeking medical treatment in the US. Nashiri's lawyer, Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Reyes, said that diplomatic immunity should not apply to Saleh in this case because he will be questioned as a witness rather than as a suspect. Reyes remarked that Pohl's refusal to allow Saleh to be questioned <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/02/14/2641594/guantanamo-judge-wont-subpoena.html">undermines Nashiri's ability to mount a capital defense</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report]. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for April. Nashiri's legal team is trying to decide if it can appeal Pohl's decision.

<p>Nashiri has been at the center of controversy for many years. In November, Nashiri <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/alleged-uss-cole-bomber-makes-first-court-appearance.php">made his first court appearance</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes relating to the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. In May, Nashiri's lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/accused-uss-cole-bomber-sues-poland-over-secret-cia-prison-site.php">filed suit against Poland</a> [JURIST report] over his alleged torture in that country.

The prosecutor in the case, Marit Bakkevig, declared that Krekar, who has been living in Norway since 1991, broke Norwegian anti-terror laws by making threats that <a href="http://www.emirates247.com/news/world/radical-kurd-leader-goes-on-trial-in-norway-2012-02-15-1.443332">were intended to incite fear in society</a> [AFP report]. In 2009, Krekar had proclaimed that if he were deported to Iraq and killed, Norwegian officials would pay with their lives. Another charge against Krekar stemmed from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9C2T_rN_4M">his appearance on the NBC News Program "The Wanted"</a> [youtube footage] in 2009, in which Krekar encouraged suicide bombings against Americans in Iraq and said America deserved the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. Krekar's lawyer proclaimed that his client stood by what he said, but that <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iSk9STElW88n2ezgB1bm70ksbE_g?docId=8a37c515dfd242fc96637621c76a4e0a">this is a test case</a> [AP report]  for drawing the line between Norway's terror laws and freedom of speech. Krekar's trial is expected to last three weeks. If found guilty of violating Norway's anti-terror laws, Krekar could face fifteen years in prison.

<p>Norway's terror laws have sparked controversy recently. Last week, JURIST guest columnist Per L&#230;greid of the University of Bergen <a href="/hotline/2012/02/per-laegreid-terror-law.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that Norway's terror laws should not be extended to individuals planning terrorist attacks, and when choosing between preventing terror and protecting civil liberties, the latter should prevail. In January, a Norwegian court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/norway-men-convicted-of-terrorism-for-plotting-attack-on-danish-newspaper.php">issued the first conviction under Norway's anti-terror law</a> [JURIST report], convicting two men who were accused of planning an attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The request was denied because the charges faced by the general are related to terrorism, and not the result of his official professional conduct. Basbug, formerly the leader of all of Turkey's armed forces, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/turkish-general-arrested-for-alleged-connection-to-ergenekon-plot.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in January for his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] network. The group allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. Basbug is the highest ranking military officer to be indicted in connection with Ergenekon. Basbug has claimed that he is innocent, and lower-ranking military officials who have been indicted have stated that they were just acting within the chain of command. Critics of the Islam-rooted AKP ruling party contend that the Ergenekon investigation is intended to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">silence the party's opponents and impose Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report], but the government denies any such charges. Basbug plans to object to his venue when his trial begins.

<p>In March 2010 the Turkish government <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-authorities-charge-33-for.php">indicted 33 defendants</a> [JURIST report] on charges of attempting to overthrow the government and establish military rule, and Turkish police <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-government-arrests-20-more-in.php">detained 20 people</a> [JURIST report]  in connection with the Ergenekon plot. Turkish <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/turkish-general-prosecutor-charged-over.php">prosecutors charged</a> [JURIST report] an army general and a state prosecutor with belonging to Ergenekon and plotting to overthrow the AKP. In February of that year more than 40 military officers were <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/turkish-court-continues-bringing.php">arrested and charged in a separate coup attempt</a> [JURIST report], the so-called <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/02/201022516176575355.html">Sledgehammer plot</a> [Al Jazeera backgrounder], to provoke a military confrontation with Greece and take advantage of the ensuing chaos. Trials against the Ergenekon group <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/turkey-begins-trial-for-alleged-coup.php">started</a> [JURIST report] in October 2008, and nearly 400 people have been charged in connection with it. The prosecution of military officials comes amid a larger effort by the AKP to reform the Turkish legal system as a step toward <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/candidate-countries/turkey/key_documents_en.htm">EU accession</a> [materials; CFR <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/8939/turkeys_eu_bid.html">backgrounder</a>].

The statement came in response to a number of adverse actions against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activists in the nation. Minister for Ethics and Integrity Simon Lokodo shut down an LGBT workshop on Tuesday by advocacy group Freedom and Roam, declaring it illegal and trying to arrest the leader. That incident occured shortly after the <a href = "http://www.parliament.go.ug/">Parliament of Uganda</a> [official website] brought back a <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-reintroduces-legislation-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">controversial anti-gay bill</a> [JURIST report] that would raise the penalty for homosexual acts from 14 years to life in prison. AI contends that Uganda's increasing persecution of the LGBT community is in violation of international law.<blockquote>The Government of Uganda must protect all people against threats, violence and harassment irrespective of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. [...] The Government's claimed opposition to the Bill needs to be supported through their actions. The Ugandan government must allow legitimate, peaceful gatherings of human rights defenders, including those working on LGBT rights.</blockquote>Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-to-drop-death-penalty-from-bill-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">agreed to drop</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty clause in the bill earlier this month. Since the bill was reintroduced there have been allegations of escalating violence against perceived homosexuals. 

<p>Uganda faces an ongoing struggle with anti-gay sentiment in the country. In November the Ugandan High Court sentenced a man to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">30 years in prison</a> for beating to death prominent gay rights activist David Kato. In January 2011 the Ugandan High Court issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/uganda-high-court-rules-anti-gay-newspaper-article-violated-constitutional-rights.php">permanent injunction</a> and awarded damages to three plaintiffs who were among 100 people alleged to be homosexuals by the Ugandan tabloid newspaper, <em>The Rolling Stone</em>. In January 2010 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-proposed.php">criticized the original anti-gay legislation</a>, saying that it could harm Uganda's reputation internationally. In February 2010, US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">publicly denounced the proposed legislation</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court ruled that the defendants, members of several Native American tribes, did not waive all sovereign immunity claims when their online business consented to private suit and could not be held in contempt of court. Following the ruling, the <a href="http://www.nativeamericanlending.org/">Native American Lending Alliance</a> (NALA) [official website] <a href="http://www.nativeamericanlending.org/native-american-lending-alliance-applauds-colorado-courts-sovereign-immunity-affirmation">said</a> [press release] the decision was a "big win" for tribal sovereign immunity:<blockquote>The decision included particularly strong language supporting absolute sovereign immunity for tribes to engage in commerce using the Internet. [T]ribal immunity applies to a tribe's governmental and commercial activities alike ... [n]ot only has every federal court of appeals addressing this issue so concluded, but the United States itself has also conceded that a tribe does not lose its immunity simply by engaging in a business through a corporate entity.</blockquote> The defendants faced criminal charges for violating the Colorado Deferred Deposit Loan Act, which required money-lenders in the state to obtain licenses. The Colorado Attorney General <a href="http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/1ffaad335b4c489397d1205f40dab295/CO--Tribal-Rights/">has not indicated</a> [AP report] whether there will be an appeal. 

<p>Tribal sovereign immunity has faced legal challenges in recent years. In 2011, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/supreme-court-remands-tribal-sovereign-immunity-suit.php">remanded the case</a> [JURIST report] of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-72.htm">Madison County v. Oneida Indian Nation</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Pet.10-72.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to the US <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website], ordering the lower court to reconsider its ruling. The Second Circuit had found that tribal sovereign immunity prevented county authorities from foreclosing on property belonging to the Oneida Indian Nation [official website]. In 2008, the US <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit </a>[official website] ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/ninth-circuit-rules-indian-tribal.php">tribal sovereign immunity applies</a> [JURIST report] to lawsuits brought in federal court dealing with the profit-making businesses of Indian tribes. In 2007, the US <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/internet.nsf">Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200702/05-1392a.pdf">upheld</a> [decision, PDF] a 2004 ruling that the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) [official website] had jurisdiction over tribunal businesses including casinos, placing the tribes under the <a href="http://www.nlrb.gov/about_us/overview/national_labor_relations_act.aspx">National Labor Relations Act</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the report, AI alleges that supporters of Gaddafi are being unlawfully detained, tortured and even killed by militias that the NTC has failed to control. The report was compiled by AI representatives who traveled to Libya in January and February and visited 11 facilities used to detain suspected Gaddafi loyalists. AI <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/news-item/amnesty-international-says-out-of-control-libyan-militias-are-commiting-widespread-abuses-against-su">reported</a> [press release] that 12 detainees have been killed while in the custody of these militias and described some of the abuse:<blockquote>Many detainees told Amnesty International that they had been beaten, including with sticks, whips and rifle butts. Several said they suffered other forms of torture, including electric shocks, burns, and threats of rape or death. Forensic examinations of some of those who died in detention provide further evidence that such methods are still being used.</blockquote>The report recommends that the NTC put an immediate end to unlawful detentions and ensure that any arrests are carried out by lawful police forces, ensure humane treatment of detainees and investigate the reported deaths of prisoners.

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. In October of last year, AI alleged that Libyan forces arrested nearly 2,500 people who face <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-officials-urged-to-stop-prisoner-abuse.php">ongoing torture and detainment</a> [JURIST report] without formal charges. In September, the NTC vowed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses after AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the Libya conflict are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate these allegations. That same month, the NTC assured world leaders that Libya will be a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-interim-leaders-pledge-adherence-to-rule-of-law.php">society of tolerance and respect </a>[JURIST report] for the rule of law. During a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14758905">meeting </a>[BBC report] in Paris chaired by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, NTC leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14613679">Mustafa Abdel Jalil</a> [BBC profiles] vowed to administer elections and draft a new constitution for Libya within 18 months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/mladic-pleads-not-guilty-trial-set-for-march.php">previous start date for the trial</a> [JURIST report] was March 27. The delay was ordered after Mladic's defense lawyers argued they <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17052637">needed more time</a> [BBC report] to sift through thousands of pages of evidence. The prosecution alone intends to present approximately 27,906 exhibits throughout the course of its case. Mladic faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages committed by Bosnian Serb forces under his command during the Bosnian civil war, which saw over 100,000 casualties and hundreds of thousands more displaced. The order also set a <a href="http://www.icty.org/sid/10919">pre-trial conference</a> [press release] for April 17. The next status conference in the case will be held on March 29.

<p>In December of last year, a three-judge panel for the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icty-judges-allow-reduced-indictment-against-mladic.php">accepted a request</a> brought by prosecutors to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icty-prosecutors-seek-to-speed-up-mladic-trial-reduce-evidence.php">reduce the number of crimes</a> [JURIST reports] they intend to prove against Mladic from 196 to 106. The request came days after the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icty-orders-mladic-medical-exam.php">ordered a medical examination</a> [JURIST report] of Mladic's physical condition in response to his absence from court the week prior due to illness. In October, the ICTY prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-prosecutor-not-appealing-refusal-to-split-mladic-trial.php">refused to seek further appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the tribunal's refusal to split Mladic's trial into separate actions: one for his conduct during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. Before that, he <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">had lost</a> his <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/mladic-lawyer-appeals-extradition-seeks-independent-medical-analysis.php">final appeal in Serbia</a> to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-finds-mladic-fit-for-extradition.php">avoid extradition</a>, and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/icty-sets-first-court-date-for-ratko-mladic.php">transported to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports]. Serbian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-arrests-elusive-war-criminal-ratko-mladic.php">captured Mladic</a> [JURIST report] in May, ending a 16-year manhunt for the former general colonel and commander of the army of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<br />

Aquino warned that the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h7JDfObC1JPwXGywjILWLMRABEeQ?docId=CNG.ba3637b47e3cc8142ba258ae51c8fca3.961">fight against corruption depended on the result</a> [AFP report] of the impeachment. Aquino invoked the "people power" revolution, which gives Filipinos the power to ensure Corona is removed from office. Aquino recalled "civil disobedience campaigns" used in the past by civilians to oust a previous dictator peacefully. He claims that if the Senate acquits Corona it will destroy his efforts against corruption in the Philippines. Corona is <a href="http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/12/12/11/summary-impeachment-complaint-vs-cj-corona">charged</a> [text] with violating the constitution and the public trust in connection with the trial of former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2614607.stm">Gloria Macapagal Arroyo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=gloria+arroyo">news archive</a>], who originally appointed Corona to the Supreme Court.

<p>Corona's <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/philippines-chief-justice-impeachment-trial-begins.php">impeachment trial began</a> [JURIST report] in January before the <a href="http://www.senate.gov.ph/">Philippine Senate</a> [official website]. If found guilty, Corona will likely be forced out of office. Aquino has targeted former president Arroyo in his anti-corruption efforts. Arroyo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-arrested-on-fraud-corruption-charges.php">recently arrested</a> [JURIST report] in the hospital before she was able to leave the country to seek medical treatment. Corona presided over the court that voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Philippine-Supreme-Court-allows-ex-president-Arroyo-to-travel-despite-pending-charges.php">allow Arroyo to travel</a> [JURIST report] to receive medical care, temporarily restraining the restrictions on Arroyo's travel in connection with several pending charges against her. Arroyo was president of the Philippines from 2001-2010. She left office after the <a href="http://www.doj.gov.ph/">Philippine Department of Justice</a> (PDOJ) [official website] brought allegations of corruption against her. Arroyo was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010 after the <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/philippines-high-court-rules-president.php">Philippine Supreme Court ruled her eligible to run</a> [JURIST report], despite protests that she had an unfair advantage. In July 2010, Aquino <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] to set up a "truth commission" to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration engaged in corruption and rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During a speech in Vienna, Austria, the Secretary General said he had urged <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">Syrian President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bashar+al-Assad">JURIST news archive</a>] to make necessary changes before the unrest spread, but Assad instead took military action against the people of Syria. Ban said that estimates show over 5,000 people have been killed since violence started 11 months ago:<blockquote>Lack of access has prevented the United Nations, the international community and humanitarian workers from knowing the full toll, yet credible reports indicate at least more than 5,400 people were killed as of last year. We have not been able to have credible information [on] how many more people have been killed between 1 January and today. Every day those numbers rise. We see neighborhoods shelled by tanks. Hospitals used as torture centers. Children as young as ten years old jailed and abused. We see almost certain crimes against humanity. The UN places the death toll around 5,000 people since the uprising started.</blockquote>On Wednesday, Al-Assad ordered a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/syria-president-orders-referendum-on-new-constitution.php">referendum on a new constitution</a> [JURIST report], which could open the country up to a multiparty political system. But some critics have argued that the referendum, scheduled for February 26, is insufficient.  

<p>The growing unrest in Syria has drawn abundant international attention recently. Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile, <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=navi+pillay">JURIST news archive</a>], in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">speech to the UN General Assembly</a> [JURIST report], called for the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund (UNICEF)</a> [official website] claimed in early February that the past 11 months of violence in Syria have led to the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">deaths of hundreds of children</a> [JURIST report]. In January, Ban <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST reports] that al-Assad end violence against Syrian civilians. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill gives same-sex couples the "all legal benefits, protections, and responsibilities of spouses" joined in marriage. On Wednesday, the Judiciary Committee <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/colorado-lawmakers-consider-civil-union-bill.php">heard testimony</a> [JURIST report] from advocates and opponents of the bill. The bill is <a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/16947883/colorado-civil-union-bill-advances-toward-showdown">expected to pass in the state senate</a> [AP report], before proceeding to the House, where House Speaker <a href="http://frankmcnulty.com/">Frank McNulty</a> (R) [official website] has voiced opposition. A similar civil union bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/colorado-senate-passes-same-sex-civil-unions-bill.php">passed in the Colorado Senate last year</a> [JURIST report], but was ultimately <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/01/us-colorado-gays-idUSTRE7306G720110401">defeated in the House</a> [Reuters report]. The Colorado constitution defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. 

<p>Issues surrounding <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] continue to occupy discussions among lawmakers and judges. On Tuesday the New Jersey Senate voted to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/nj-senate-votes-to-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">approve a bill</a> [JURIST report] that, if passed, would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. Washington Governor Christine Gregoire <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] Monday legalizing same-sex marriage, making Washington the eighth jurisdiction in the US to offer marriage to same-sex couples. Earlier this month, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Proposition 8, California's ban on same-sex marriage, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].

The bill is designed to expand all personhood rights to the unborn: <blockquote>The life of each human being begins at conception;...The laws of this state shall be interpreted and construed to acknowledge on behalf of the unborn child at every stage of development all the rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons, citizens, and residents of this state.</blockquote> <a href="http://www.ok.gov/governor/About/index.html">Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin</a> [official profile], who <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-banning-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">signed legislation</a> [JURIST report] last year banning abortions after 20 weeks, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/16/us-oklahoma-personhood-idUSTRE81F0ES20120216">did not comment</a> [Reuters report] on the new legislation.

The initiative, which would have given fetuses rights from the moment of conception, was defeated by more than 55 percent of the state's voters.

The fire occurred this past Tuesday and killed more than 300 inmates while injuring dozens more. According to HRW, Honduras prisoners suffer overcrowding which leads to poor prison conditions including inadequate nutrition and sanitation, all leading to the tragic result earlier this week. Americas Director at HRW, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/jos-miguel-vivanco">Jose Miguel Vivanco</a> [official profile], stated, "The tragic deaths of hundreds of inmates, one of the worst incidents of its kind in the region, are ultimately the result of overcrowding and poor prison conditions, two longstanding problems in Honduras." According to local press, Honduras has 24 prisons with a total capacity of 8,000. These prisons currently hold 13,000 prisoners, well over capacity. 

<p>The US also has prison overcrowding concerns, particularly in California. Last year, the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-1233.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1233">Brown v.

La Procura is calling for a <a href="http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2012/02/16/news/berlusconi_sostegno_a_monti_fino_a_approvazione_riforme_indispensabili-29976352/index.html?ref=search">tribunal of Berlusconi and 11 others</a> [<em>La Repubblico</em> report, in Italian] as part of a broader inquiry into <a href="http://www.mediaset.it/corporate/index_it.shtml/">Mediaset</a> [corporate website, in Italian], the media group owned by Italy's former figurehead. Specifically, the prosecutors say that Mediaset violated Italian tax laws when it bought the rights of Hollywood films and TV shows, and that Berlusconi and his son, Pier Silvio, were part of a scheme to defraud the tax authorities of 10 million euros, or $13.07 million, by inflating invoices between 2004 and 2005. At the moment, the controversial former prime minister is facing three other trials, including a bribery case and two corruption cases. Berlusconi, however, attributes all of the charges to political attacks from his adversaries. In an <a href="http://www.giornalettismo.com/archives/201643/la-lettera-di-silvio-al-giornale/">open letter</a> [text, in Italian] to the Milan-based newspaper <em><a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/">Il Giornale</a></em> [media website, in Italian], Berlusconi wrote in Italian:
<blockquote>I have a conscience; to have served my country in these years with all of my strength, and I am rewarded with a persistence on the part of some magistrates in Milan that have no historical equal. They want to tear down my image as a man, a businessman, and a politician. What saddens me most is to see the extent to which justice can be bent to political and ideological prejudices.</blockquote>Amid the controversy, prosecutors have not responded to the ex-prime minister's decree, and the Roman court has yet to rule if the case will move forward.

<p>Berlusconi, who resigned as Italian prime minister in November 2011, has been a defendant in nearly fifty cases. Most recently, he is facing charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports]. The former Italian leader was hailed to a Milan court in April 2011 to combat the same <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/berlusconi-appears-in-court-calls-tax-fraud-hearing-a-waste-of-time.php">tax fraud charges</a> at issue now, but then, as acting prime minister, Berlosconi dismissed the charges as a "waste of time" and <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/3d281c11a96b4ad082fe88aa0db04305/Article_2011-04-11-EU-Italy-Berlusconi-Trial/id-8374024c2b944ca2ae7311d47f56e3a9">left the trial</a> [AP report]. In January 2011, the <a href="http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_320.do">Italian Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of an <a href="http://www.senato.it/leg/16/BGT/Schede/Ddliter/34882.htm">immunity law</a> [materials, in Italian] supported by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier temporary amnesty from any charges while in office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 25-year old Nigerian national, who has been linked to al Qaeda, unsuccessfully attempted to detonate an underwear bomb while on Northwest Airlines flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. The bomb created a fire, but failed to explode, burning Abdulmutallab without causing fatalities to other passengers. During Abdulmutallab's sentence the presiding judge, Nancy G. Edmunds, stated that Abdulmutallab "has never expressed doubt or regret or remorse about his mission." He was sentenced on all 8 counts of <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/News/Docs/indictment.pdf">indictment</a> [text, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/accused-plane-bomber-facing-additional-federal-charges.php">report</a>] including conspiracy to commit terrorism, attempted murder and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. Following Thursday's decision, the family of Abdulmutallab <a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/C4185212216.PDF">urged the court</a> [statement, PDF] to reconsider the life sentence.

Two of the four men, Cesar and Nicolas Perez, have already fled to Miami. The announcement that Carlos Perez had been granted asylum came <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jfy6XTdstJE1ZpuA0ScZvTW9_m1A?docId=CNG.4dace657cc25282284b6c0b4089d75c3.81">shortly after</a> [AFP report] Ecuador's highest court, the National Court of Justice, <a href="http://www.presidencia.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1618:esta-sentencia-crea-un-precedente-no-solo-en-ecuador-sino-en-america&catid=39:noticias-importantes&Itemid=98">upheld the conviction against the four <em>El Universo</em> managers</a> [press release, in Spanish]. The men were sentenced to three years in prison each and fined USD $40 million in total. Correa indicated that he was surprised that Panama granted the men asylum because, in his view, they were common criminals and not persecuted political activists. He also stated on Thursday that he was <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/02/ecuador-president-rafael-correa-el-universo-newspaper.html">considering pardoning</a> [<em>LA Times</em> report] the men. The <em>El Universo</em> officials stated that they will bring an appeal to the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/default.asp">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> [official website] to fight the verdict.

<p>Correa remains resolute that the media in Ecuador is corrupt and must be harnessed. In a <a href = "http://www.elciudadano.gov.ec/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26227:presidente-correa-se-esta-acabando-el-reino-del-terror-marcado-por-la-prensa-corrupta&catid=40:actualidad&Itemid=63">statement</a> [<em>El Ciudadano</em>, in Spanish], he called the suit one of his greatest legacies because now the Ecuadoran "corrupt press" know they cannot "damage the honor of a person." He also pointed to <em>El Universo</em>'s willingness to apologize as a sign of their culpability: "[T]hey knew they had committed a crime, but pride prevented them, as required by the Constitution, to correct [their error]." <em>El Universo</em>, in fact, offered several times to retract the editorial, allow Correa to write his own correction and settle out-of-court, but Correa's lawyer refused their settlement offers. <em>El Universo</em> remains defiant. The newspaper's front page on the day of the verdict displayed a headline of "Condemned" followed by an Ayn Rand quotation: "When you see that men get richer by graft and pull than by work, and your laws don&#8217;t protect you against them, but protect them against you&#8212;when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice&#8212;you may know that your society is doomed." <em>El Universo</em>'s <a href = "http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/07/21/1/1355/juez-otorga-correa-40-millones-dispone-prision-directivos-diario.html?p=1354&m=1835">report</a> [text, in Spanish] states they believe Ecuador's libel laws are in violation of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, for using criminal law to punish expressions against public officials. Correa has another suit pending against journalists Juan Carlos Calderon and Christian Zurita for their book <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/Hermano-Carlos-Calder%C3%B3n-Christian-Zurita/dp/9978230513">Big Brother</a> [Amazon profile], which claimed that Correa's brother had awarded millions of dollars of government contracts to businesses for his own profit. <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] criticized Correa rallying  against journalists earlier this year and <a href = "http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2011/03/31/ecuador-don-t-prosecute-president-s-critics">pleaded with him to not prosecute journalists</a> [report text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Anti-gay activists argue that homosexual sex is banned under <a href="http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S377.htm">Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code</a> [text] which criminalizes unnatural "carnal intercourse." In response, the court <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/no-law-says-homosexuality-is-unnatural...-society-has-changed-sc/913180/">questioned</a> [<em>The Indian Express</em> report] whether the law was ever intended to criminalize homosexuality because it does not specifically mention homosexuality. The court also pointed out that while homosexuality may be abnormal, that does not necessarily mean that it is unnatural. The court went on to state that the law must be viewed <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/homosexuality-is-to-be-seen-in-context-of-changing-society-supreme-court-177129">in the context of changing societal values</a> [<em>New Delhi Television</em> report].

<p>Homosexuality is an international issue that many countries struggle to deal with. Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/Uganda-must-end-antigay-human-rights-violations-AI.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the government of Uganda for shutting down a LGBT workshop and attempting to arrest the leader. Earlier this month, Uganda <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-reintroduces-legislation-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">reintroduced legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would criminalize certain homosexual activities, including dictating a life sentence for individuals who enter into a same-sex marriage. In June, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-africa-countries-respect-gay-rights.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that African countries honor the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> [text] by ending discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. According to the <a href="http://ilga.org/">International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association</a> [advocacy website] <a href="http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2011.pdf">State-Sponsored Homophobia report</a> [text, PDF], 76 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, and five enforce the death penalty against homosexuals.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The approved <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A0500/1_I1.PDF">legislation</a> [Marriage Equality and Religious Exemption Act, PDF] was forwarded to <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] on Friday morning. Christie has stated that he <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2012/02/14/nj-senates-approval-of-same-sex-marriage-sets-up-fight-with-christie/">plans to veto the bill</a> [WSJ report], believing the issue should be placed before the voters of the state in a referendum. Both chambers are currently lacking the two-thirds needed to overrule a veto. In order to override such a veto, 27 votes will be needed in the Senate and 54 votes in the Assembly.  

<p>Thursday's outcome was expected after the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/Default.asp">New Jersey Senate</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/nj-senate-votes-to-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report] on Monday, in a vote of 24-16. Approval of the legislation marks a shift from the legislature's previous position concerning same-sex marriage. A similar bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-senate-defeats-same-sex.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] in the state Senate last year. In November, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state's current civil union law as a contravention of both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the New Jersey State Constitution.

The CTBT bans the testing of nuclear weapons internationally, but it will not come into force until it is ratified by the US, Iran and six other countries. Iran has claimed that it is not developing nuclear weapons and is researching nuclear power as another energy option, whereas the US has a <a href = "http://www.brookings.edu/projects/archive/nucweapons/weapons.aspx">well-developed nuclear weapon program</a> [Brookings Institute report]. Ban called on all nations to ratify the treaty and end research on nuclear weaposn: <blockquote>So today I issue a challenge to all leaders of all countries that have not yet endorsed the CTBT: Visit the site of a nuclear test. Speak to the population exposed to the fallout. Then take action to prevent this from ever happening again. Today, on this fifteenth anniversary, we remember the victims. At the same time, we remember the hope in which the CTBT was conceived. The hope for a future where international peace and security do not depend on the mad doctrine of mutually assured destruction or hang on the thin thread of good luck. Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are not utopian ideals. They are critical to global peace and security. We have a legal and moral obligation to rid our world of nuclear tests and nuclear weapons. When we put an end to nuclear tests, we get closer to eliminating all nuclear weapons. A world free of nuclear weapons will be safer and more prosperous. Governments now spend vast sums of money to build and test arsenals of death. The world is over-armed and development is under-funded. It is time to reverse that equation.</blockquote>After the speech, Ban <a href = "http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5goUEMsGIMgiooAyXkQnPsBwI0K0A?docId=8e47315458cf4cebbb3127100f9eb1c7">spoke to reporters</a> [AP report] about an <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [official website] <a href="http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2011/gov2011-65.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] published in November that claimed there were activities in Iran that were "specific to nuclear weapons." Ban urged Iran to cooperate with international diplomacy efforts on its nuclear program.

<p>There continues to be international debate over Iran's nuclear program and whether or not the nation is seeking a nuclear weapon. Earlier this month, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/obama-signs-order-imposing-stricter-sanctions-on-iran.php">US began imposing strict sanctions on Iran</a> because of its nuclear program. Iran claims that <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-threatens-iaea-withdrawal-if.php">its nuclear rights are being taken away</a> [JURIST reports], but there are those who argue the <a href="/forum/2011/11/dan-joyner-iaea-report.php">IAEA has a legal right to regulate nuclear weapons</a> [JURIST op-ed]. There has also been a continued international response from the UN with <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-security-council-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran.php">new sanctions being imposed in June 2010</a> to increase the restrictions placed on Iran from the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-security-council-imposes-nuclear.php">first set of sanctions in 2006</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The exact number of those detained is not known, but it is thought to be several hundred. Those detained had gone to India to hear the teachings of the <a href="http://www.dalailama.com/">Dalai Lama</a> [official website] with valid travel documents, only to be captured upon their return. HRW called the arrest of properly documented travelers "unprecedented" and noted that this is the first known widespread detention of laypeople since 1970. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/bios/sophie-richardson">Sophie Richardson</a> [HRW profile], China director at HRW, said in a statement: <blockquote>Arbitrarily detaining people and forcing them to undergo political indoctrination is an abuse of Chinese and international laws. [...] Authorities in the region should release these individuals, as their detention only escalates the tension in Tibetan regions which already have increased limits on travel and communication as well as troop and security presence.</blockquote> The report notes further that the ethnic Chinese who attended the Dalai Lama's teachings were not detained, which suggests the detentions were motivated purely by ethnicity. 

<p>China has long imposed strict restrictions on Tibet. In November 2011, the UN formally <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-concerned-with-china-restrictions-on-Tibet.php">expressed concern</a> over China's treatment of Tibet. That June, concern over an influc of missing persons prompted a UN rights body to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-body-demands-china-report-on-missing-persons.php">demand a report on disappearances</a>. The same month, the US requested China <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/us-urges-china-to-release-tiananmen-square-protesters.php">release peaceful protesters</a> arrested in Tiananmen Square. In July of 2010, HRW published a report alleging <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-used-excessive-force-in-suppressing-tibet-protesters-hrw.php">China violated international law</a> [JURIST reports] in its treatment of Tibetan protesters. <a href="/hotline/2009/05/secrecy-in-chinas-trials-of-tibetan.php">Secrecy in China's judicial system</a> [JURIST comment] often raises <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=china+human+rights">human rights concerns</a> [JURIST news archive] over prisoners being held there. <br />

The parents argued that the courses would teach their children things contrary to their own religious values, and had previously challenged the requirement through their school board, which denied their requests. They asked the court to declare that the program was an infringement on their children's constitutional rights to religion and to review the school board's decision to not exempt them from the courses. In the court's dismissal, Justice Marie Deschamps stated: <blockquote>Although the sincerity of a person's belief that a religious practice must be observed is relevant to whether the person's right to freedom of religion is at issue, an infringement of this right cannot be established without objective proof of an interference with the observance of that practice.  In this case, given the trial judge's findings of fact and the evidence in the record concerning the neutrality of the ERC Program, I conclude that the appellants have failed to prove such an interference.</blockquote>Deschamps also wrote that "early exposure of children to realities that differ from those in their immediate family environment is a fact of life in society," and that exposure "does not in itself constitute an infringement."

<p>The Ethics and Religious Culture Program was created in 2008 as a replacement for the Moral Education, Catholic Religious and Moral Instruction, and Protestant Moral Education and Religious Education courses that existed at the time. Denis Watters, head of the ERCP at the <a href="http://www.mels.gouv.qc.ca/">Quebec Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport</a> [official website], said the ERCP is designed "to equip [students] with knowledge that will help them decode the meanings of the various religious expressions around them," not to push any of the religions on students. There are often instances of tension between religious freedom and educational requirements in other countries as well. In 2009, Germany's high court r<a href="/paperchase/2009/08/germany-high-court-rejects-religious.php">ejected a religious challenge</a> against required sexual education classes. In 2008, a US federal court ruled that Pennsylvania educational requirements <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/third-circuit-upholds-pennsylvania-home.php">did not violate</a> [JURIST reports] religious rights of children who are home schooled. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The resolution supports a <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/wcm/connect/5916140049a5bac2a59affcde376ffea/oooo.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=5916140049a5bac2a59affcde376ffea">plan</a> [text, PDF, in Arabic] advanced by the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/portal/en/home_page">Arab League</a> [official website] that aims to bring the situation in Syria to a close as quickly as possible by encouraging <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=Bashar+al-Assad">news archive</a>] to step down. There were <a href = "http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41265">12 votes against the resolution</a> [UN News Centre report] including Russia, China, Iran and Bolivia. <blockquote>By other terms of the text adopted today, the Assembly expressed its full support for the Arab League's decision to facilitate a Syrian-led political transition to a democratic, pluralistic political system, including through a "serious political dialogue between the [Syrian Government] and the whole spectrum of the Syrian opposition."  Reaffirming its strong commitment to Syria's sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, it further reaffirmed that all Member States "should refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State." </blockquote>Amendments by Russia that "proposed to place reasonable demands on opposition forces to disassociate themselves from armed groups and to demand that those groups themselves stop their attacks" were rejected. In response to the resolution, the representative for Syria called the resolution and the Arab League's actions a "Trojan horse," and argued that the Arab League is now controlled primarily by Western oil companies. He also stated that his country is responding to calls for reform, specifically noting a recently announced <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/syria-president-orders-referendum-on-new-constitution.php">referendum for a new constitution</a> [JURIST report].

<p>The growing unrest in Syria has drawn copious international attention recently. Earlier this week, both <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> and <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [JURIST reports], called for an end to the violence in Syria, with Pillay asking the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) claimed earlier in February that the past 11 months of violence in Syria have <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">led to the deaths of hundreds of children</a> [JURIST report]. In January, Ban <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that al-Assad end violence against Syrian civilians. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill passed by a 72 to 67 vote and is set to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/same-sex-marriage-bill-passes-maryland-house-of-delegates/2012/02/17/gIQARk7XKR_story.html?wpisrc=al_comboNP">move on to the Senate</a> [WP report], where it must pass to receive the governor's approval. Those opposing same-sex marriage in Maryland are expected to put up strong resistance to the bill by holding petition drives that, if they receive enough support, could get the bill placed on the November ballot and give voters the final say. A similar bill was proposed last year in Maryland but <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/maryland-house-fails-to-advance-bill-legalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">failed to pass the House</a> [JURIST report] after it was approved by the Senate.  If approved by all parties, Maryland would become the eighth state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow same-sex marriage. <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us/">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> [official website], who <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/blog/?p=4216">praised the vote</a> [statement text], has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/omalley-unveils-agenda-including-same-sex-marriage-bill/2012/01/23/gIQAV8gMMQ_story.html">promised to sign the bill</a> [WP report] once it passes the Senate.

<p>Maryland is not the only state that has been trying to pass bill that would allows same-sex couples to marry. Earlier this week, Washington <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">legalized same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] after Governor Christine Gregoire on Monday signed legislation. New Jersey is also considering legalizing same-sex marriage soon, although it currently has a civil union system in place. In November, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the Fourteenth Amendment and the New Jersey State Constitution. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rana allegedly provided financial support to Headley and used contacts which he had gained while doing business for an immigration consultancy group in Chicago. The charge sheet also accuses several Pakistani military officials of providing aid for the terror attack.

<p>In March 2010 an Indian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/india-court-hears-final-arguments-in.php">heard final arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the trial of <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075633&type=News">Mohammed Ajmal Kasab</a> [NDTV backgrounder], the lone surviving gunman, for his role in the terror attack. Kasab requested an international trial, arguing that he could not receive a fair trial in India, but was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/india-court-rejects-mumbai-terror.php">denied</a> [JURIST report]. He also withdrew his confession, claiming that he was <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/mumbai-terror-attack-suspect-withdraws.php">tortured and framed by the police</a> [JURIST report] but the confession was nonetheless admitted against him. Earlier that month Headley <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/mumbai-terror-suspect-pleads-guilty-in.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] in the US to 12 counts of federal terrorism for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attack and a plot to bomb the headquarters of Danish newspaper <a href="http://jp.dk/">Jyllands-Posten</a> [media website, in Danish], which published <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=cartoon">controversial cartoons</a> [JURIST news archive] depicting the Prophet Muhammad.

In his veto statement, Christie defended the legal importance of a voter referendum: <blockquote>The framers of our State Constitution created the referendum process in Article IX as the sole mechanism by which the Constitution can be amended to consider precisely such important issues. I have repeatedly encouraged, and continue to ask that, the Legislature trust the people of New Jersey and seek their input by allowing our citizens to vote on the question of same-sex marriage. This path of amending the State Constitution, which embraces our most cherished democratic ideals and is enshrined in our guiding legal document, is the only way to amend our Constitution and the best way to resolve the issue of same-sex marriage in our State.</blockquote> Christie's veto comes only one day after the New Jersey State Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/nj-assembly-votes-to-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">approved the bill</a> [JURIST report]. Christie stated that there was no constitutional right to same-sex marriage and that New Jersey gay couples have all the rights of married couples through civil unions.

<p>The New Jersey State Assembly approved the bill 42-33 and the State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/nj-senate-votes-to-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill 24-16. Approval of the legislation marks a shift from the legislature's previous position concerning same-sex marriage. A similar bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-senate-defeats-same-sex.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] in the state Senate last year. In November, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state's current civil union law as a contravention of both the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] and the New Jersey State Constitution. On Monday, Washington <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">became the eighth jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] in the US legalizing same-sex marriage.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the letter, Holder explains that denying such benefits to same-sex couples legal married under state law on the basis of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/101">Title 38</a> [text], sections 101(3) and 101(31) is unconstitutional. Section 101(3) defines "surviving spouse" as a person of the opposite sex and section 101(31) defines the term "spouse" in general as a person of the opposite sex. As such, Holder has instructed the Department of Justice to cease legal defense of those provisions. He says in the letter: <blockquote>The legislative record of these provisions contains no rationale for providing veterans' benefits to opposite sex spouses of veterans but not to legally married same-sex spouses of veterans. Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of Veterans Affairs identified any justifications for that distinction that could warrant treating these provisions differently from Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act.</blockquote> Holder's rationale comes out of a determination that "classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a heightened standard of scrutiny under equal protection principles." The letter informs Boehner of how the DOJ will procede in a pending case, <em>McLaughlin v. Panetta</em>, involving veterans benefits.

<p>This is the latest in the Obama Administration's fight for marriage equality. The ruling is likely to affect a <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/downloads/case/2-1-2012CooperHarris.pdf">suit</a> [text, PDF] brought earlier this month over the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-veteran-sues-over-denial-of-benefits-to-same-sex-spouse.php">denial of disability benefits to a same-sex spouse of a veteran</a> [JURIST report]. President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">reaffirmed his commitment</a> [JURSIT report] to repealing the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3396.ENR:">Defense of Marriage Act</a> (DOMA) [text] last October. He has also made it clear that he supports the proposed <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">proposed last March</a> [JURIST report].

The Montana court ruling in <a href="http://searchcourts.mt.gov/getDocument?vid={1C0B7886-01C0-49E3-A71A-C06CA7E71040}">Western Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Montana</a> [opinion, PDF] appears to conflict with the 2010 US Supreme Court ruling in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-205.pdf">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>], which struck down a regulation that prohibited corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds for "electioneering communications" aimed at supporting or opposing a political candidate. The <a href="http://peoplespowerleague.info/about/about.htm">1912 Corrupt Practices Act</a> [text] upheld by the Montana Supreme Court prohibits the same activity. The plaintiffs will now have to apply for a writ of certiorari to have the case heard by the Court. If cert is granted, this case is likely to play out as an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/02/the-supreme-court-citizens-united-ii-and-the-november-election/">attempt to narrow the scope of, or overrule</a> [SCOTUS blog] <u>Citizens United</u>.

<p><a href="http://www.americantradition.org">American Trade Partnership</a>, <a href="http://www.mtssa.org/">Montana Shooting Sports Association</a> [advocacy websites] and Champion Painting, plaintiffs in this case, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/groups-petition-supreme-court-to-overturn-montana-ban-on-corporate-campaign-spending.php">petitioned the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] to overturn the Montana court's decision last week. The Montana court ruled that the law did not violate the First Amendment and distinguished it from <u>Citizens United</u> because it still allowed for corporations to voice their political opinions in other ways, including lobbying and creating political action committees. The plaintiffs argue that upholding this law directly conflicts with the <u>Citizens United</u> ruling. <a href="/currentawareness/campaignfinance.php">Campaign finance</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a hot button issue ever since that ruling, which led the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-wisconsin-campaign-finance-law.php">strike down</a> [JURIST report] a Wisconsin law that limited the amount any individual could donate to political action committees in a year.

The letter was a response to a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204880404577225380456599176.html">Wall Street Journal article</a> [text] published Friday, which charged that Google has been bypassing privacy settings of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> [official website] web browser so that it can track users without their consent. Safari, which is the default web-browser on all Apple products and most used browser on all mobile devices, is designed to block websites from being able to track users. Google got around this by using a special code that prevented Safari from recognizing it and allowed it to track users through almost any website. In their letter, the Congressmen asked the FTC to investigate whether these practices are in violation of a 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">settlement agreement</a> [JURIST report] it reached with the Commission after a breach of privacy rights during the launch of its social networking site Google Buzz. Under the settlement, Google is prohibited from misrepresenting its privacy policies to consumers and and must obtain consent from users before sharing their information with third parties.

<p>The Congressmen also said that these practices are a "major concern" in light of the controversy surrounding announcement of its new <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/preview/">privacy policy</a> [text] set to take place on March 1. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> [advocacy website], a consumer privacy research center, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/consumer-watchdog-files-suit-to-block-google-privacy-changes.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Google, alleging that the new policy is in violation of its settlement agreement. Legality of the new policy has also been called into question by the EU, which <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/eu-asks-google-to-delay-new-privacy-policy.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Google earlier this month asking it to delay implementation until it can fully investigate the policy. That letter was sent a day after Google <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">responded</a> to a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">letter from US Congressmen</a> [JURIST reports] posing 11 questions about how consumer privacy rights will be affected by the changes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Richard Arnold ruled that the operators of The Pirate Bay planned to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-20/pirate-bay-website-infringes-u-k-record-copyrights-judge-rules.html">infringe the copyright</a> [Bloomberg report] of Sony and other recording labels and led the users of their website to do the same. Although The Pirate Bay was not a defendant in the suit, nor were the operators of the website, the plaintiff record labels can obtain a court order that would force Internet service providers to block access to the website. The Pirate Bay is a file-sharing website that allows users to download music and films. The website has been charged with both criminal and civil violations in other countries, including Sweden. 

<p>Earlier this month the Swedish Supreme Court announced that it will <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/sweden-high-court-refuses-to-hear-appeal-in-pirate-bay-case.php">not hear an appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the copyright convictions of Fredrik Neji, Peter Sunde and Carl Lundstroem for their involvement in running The Pirate Bay. After reviewing the case, the court found there were no special circumstances warranting review. The court could also have decided to hear the case if it determined a review by Sweden's highest court would be important for the country's law enforcement, but it declined to hear the appeal on those ground as well. The court's decision not to hear the appeal immediately prompted response from critics. The founder of the <a href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/">Pirate Party</a> [party website in Swedish], a political party in Sweden, <a href="http://www.piratpartiet.se/nyheter/h%C3%B6gsta-domstolen-avsl%C3%A5r-pr%C3%B6vning-av-pirate-bay-m%C3%A5let">expressed concern</a> [press release in Swedish] over the court's decision not to hear the case calling it a "fundamentally important" case that, if decided by the high court, would help to sort out future cases.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The monastery was destroyed and closed by government forces after the 2007 <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burma-inside-the-saffron-revolution-403645.html">Saffron Revolution</a> [<em>Independent</em>, backgrounder], a peaceful pro-democracy movement led by Gambira and other Buddhist monks. Since the pardoning of his 68-year sentence for leading the revolt, Gambira has <a href="http://www.mizzima.com/news/prisoner-watch/6611-gambira-faces-criminal-charges-state-run-newspaper.html">criticized senior monks</a> [Mizzima report] of a state-appointed Buddhist organization, the Sangha Nayaka Committee (SNC), for failing to fight for the release of other monks arrested following the 2007 demonstrations. The senior SNC monks have called for the government to take legal measures against Gambira for his political actions and alleged violations of the Buddhist code. Police arrested Gambira on February 10 and released him the same day after facing international criticism. A leader of the <a href="http://allburmamonksalliance.org/">All Burma Monks' Alliance</a> [website], Gambira has questioned the sincerity of recent government reforms in the country.

<p>Myanmar's nominally civilian government has implemented numerous political reforms since winning the first elections held in 20 years in March 2011. Last month, in addition to releasing political prisoners, Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thein Sein</a> [BBC backgrounder] signed a clemency order that <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/myanmar-reduces-prisoners-sentences-on-allegedly-humanitarian-grounds.php">shortened sentences</a> [JURIST report] for many prisoners on humanitarian grounds. In December, Sein gave his official approval to a bill allowing the country's citizens to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/myanmar-president-approves-peaceful-protest-bill.php">conduct peaceful protests</a> [JURIST report], if the protests are approved in advance. The Myanmar government also announced in December that the political party of opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=suu+kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [JURIST news archive] would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/suu-kyis-party-granted-legal-status-for-myanmar-elections.php">allowed to register</a> for the next elections, a move that would allow Suu Kyi to run for parliament after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">detained under house arrest</a> [JURIST reports] for nearly eight years.

Since his December arrest in the West Bank, Adnan has <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/apnews/46af8eaca1184b388ac75a3e0a96790b">refused food</a> [AP report]. This hunger strike has been carried on to protest Israel's policy of detaining Palestinian prisoners without bringing formal charges, presenting evidence, and without a trial. The spokeswoman for the Israeli Court released this information on the condition of remaining anonymous. Adnan's strike marks the longest lasting hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee in history. Doctors warn that Adnan may not survive long enough to stand trial.

<p>Israel has recently faced criticism for the country's policy toward Palestinians. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-israel-to-end-residency-restrictions.php">urged Israel</a> [JURIST report] to change its policies that forbid Palestinians from traveling through and living in Gaza and the West Bank. The Israeli Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-supreme-court-upholds-citizenship-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that prevents Palestinians who marry Israelis from obtaining Israeli citizenship. With its ruling the court again rejected the petition filed by <a href="http://www.adalah.org/">Adalah</a> [advocacy website], a civil rights group in Israel, arguing that the law is unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge James Pohl made the decision earlier this month in the case of suspected <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=USS+cole">USS Cole</a> [JURIST news archive] bomber <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [NYT profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=nashiri">news archive</a>], but the decision may also apply in other cases, including the cases of detainees accused of involvement in the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 terror attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Although the document has not been released by the Pentagon, al-Nashiri's lawyer described the decision to AFP, saying that mail inspectors are <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/judge-bars-screeners-revealing-guantanamo-mail-232039849.html">"greatly restricted"</a> [AFP report] in sharing "anything they learned with anyone other than the judge." Pohl ruled on motions protesting a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/gitmo_orders_20111227.pdf">new policy</a> [text, PDF] that allows members of a privileged review team to <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=66820">conduct a "plain-view review" of written communications</a> [DOD press release] not marked as protected attorney-client information to ensure the correspondence does not contain physical or information contraband, such as maps of the detention facility. Guantanamo Navy Rear Admiral <a href="http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/xWEBSITE/command/cdr.html">David Woods</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/guantanamo-commander-defends-policy-of-reading-prisoner-mail.php">defended the policy</a> [JURIST report] last month at the opening day of al-Nashiri's pretrial hearings, testifying that it balances his responsibilities to facilitate attorney-client communication while also ensuring security, safety, guard protection and good order at the facility.

<p>Lawyers for Guantanamo detainees have previously raised concerns with practices used at the prison. Earlier this month, James Connell, defense lawyer for suspected 9/11 conspirator Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, filed suit in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/lawyer-for-911-suspect-challenges-government-review-of-legal-correspondence.php">challenging the order</a> [JURIST report] for military officials to read all legal correspondence between the lawyers of the suspected 9/11 conspirators and their clients. Last month, Chief Defense Counsel for Guantanamo Bay war crimes tribunals, Colonel JP Colwel, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/guantanamo-chief-defense-counsel-refuses-to-allow-review-of-attorney-letters.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] attorneys under his command not to comply with the policy. Woods <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/guantanamo-rule-change-to-require-review-of-attorney-letters.php">issued the rules</a> [JURIST report] in December. Lawyers for the prisoners responded with a written memo stating that they did not agree to the rule because it violates attorney-client privilege and would erode their clients' right to counsel that is afforded by the US <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.txt">Constitution</a> [text]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Preliminary results from the national referendum show that 74.8 percent of voters rejected adding the Russian language with only 24.88 percent in favor of having two state languages. The percentage split of domestic votes also represents approximately the decision of those citizens abroad in foreign countries. The referendum vote had the highest national voter turnout since 1991 (when Latvia regained its independence) with 70.73 percentof eligible voters casting a ballot. There are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gv1ET9lg6_a1q6_iOetBZu8Infmw?docId=ebbecd73c3a44ba5a58e7604533a0f4e">approximately 300,000 non-citizens in Latvia</a> [AP report]. This is because under current law anyone who moved to Latvia during the Soviet occupation after WWII must pass the Latvian language exam to gain citizenship. The hope of the referendum, even though failed, is that it will draw attention to the nation's minority who have not received the right to vote or work in government and to encourage dialogue between the government and national minorities. 

<p>In 2008, Latvian voters <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/latvia-referendum-to-amend-constitution.php">rejected a referendum</a> [JURIST report] to amend the country's constitution that would have given voters the power to dissolve the country's parliament, even though some voters remained discontented with the government and say that the Latvian MPs do not act in accordance with voter's wishes. Latvia was formally part of the Soviet Union, but joined NATO in April 2004. A month later the country officially entered the EU. The Latvian parliament has since <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/latvia-lithuania-approve-eu-lisbon.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] the new <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=EU+reform+treaty+">EU reform treaty</a> [JURIST news archive], properly known as the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_ref_cm7294_eureformtreaty">Treaty of Lisbon</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/index_en.htm">official website</a>].</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to Ban, the agreement provides the steps that <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2863.htm">Somalia</a> [DOS backgrounder] must take in order to go about  "ending the transition and putting in place a constitutional order in a new federal Somalia." The agreement also includes a provision that requires a minimum of 30 percent women to be included in the Independent Electoral Commission, the Constituent Assembly and the new Federal Parliament. Also known as the Garowe II Principles, the agreement was signed by six high-ranking diplomats including president of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/somalia/somalias-transitional-government/p12475">Transitional Federal Government</a> (TFG) [CFR backgrounder] Sharif Sheikh Ahmed and Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Gaas. The conference, which opened last Wednesday, was planned as an attempt to organize Somalia's most prominent diplomats in order to discuss the country's federal constitution, which has yet to be implemented. The conference came to a close on Friday.

<p>The Garowe II Conference is one of the many steps the TFG has taken in order to create a functioning federal government in Somalia since the end of the <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547169/Mohamed-Siad-Barre">Muhammad Siad Barre</a> [Britannica profile] dictatorship in 1991. The plan for the new government developed at the conference is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17088433">designed to replace the TFG</a> [BBC report] and put in place a stable, more permanent government. There is skepticism among many observers as to whether this agreement will be implemented because Somalia has been involved in multiple agreements throughout the past few years. Details in the plan that need further development are expected to be worked out at the Somali conference in London, set to begin Thursday. Due to the lack of organized government in Somalia, maritime piracy has recently been a major issue. In November, <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/france-to-prosecute-suspected-somali-pirates.php">France began the trial of six Somali pirates</a> [JURIST report] on charges of hijacking, kidnapping and armed robbery in connection with a 2008 attack on a yacht.

The decision intended to temporarily enjoin the <A href = "/paperchase/2012/01/ecuador-court-upholds-multi-billion-dollar-fine-against-chevron.php">recently upheld $18 billion fine</a> [JURIST report] from any international efforts of collection. The interim injunction would last until the PCA makes its final arbitration decision. The Provincial Court of Justice rejected this approach, stating that Ecuadorian citizens' <a href = "http://www.ecuadortimes.net/2012/02/20/chevron-ecuador-court-rejects-the-opinion-of-the-hague-tribunal/">human rights supersede international trade law</a> [<em>Ecuador Times</em> report]. They also allowed Chevron's <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/chevron-appeals-ecuador-courts-18-billion-fine.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] to ascend to the Supreme Court of Ecuador. The injunction is supposed to be upheld by all countries that are signatories to The Hague Convention, but plaintiffs insist they will continue to pursue their collection efforts in other courts, including the <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/second-circuit-allows-ecuador-courts-18-billion-judgment-against-chevron.php">US Second Circuit Court of Appeals</a> [JURIST report].

<p>Damages were initially awarded last February by the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios, which found that Texaco, acquired by Chevron in 2001, polluted large areas of the country's rain forest and the Amazon river. Chevron has argued that the damages award violates Ecuador's constitution because the court failed to correct or punish alleged fraud and corruption committed by plaintiffs' lawyers. Also, Chevron contended that because it inherited the case from its takeover of Texaco, an oil company who was released from such liability by Ecuador in the 1990s, it too should be released from liability. The judgment was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/ecuador-court-upholds-multi-billion-dollar-fine-against-chevron.php">upheld in January</a> [JURIST report] by a three-judge panel of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios. Though the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">fine was initially set at $8.6 billion</a> [JURIST report], it was more than doubled for Chevron's refusal to pay "moral reparations" to the Ecuadorian government, as required by the original ruling. The <a href="http://www.texacotoxico.org/eng/">Amazon Defense Coalition</a> [advocacy website], the Ecuadorian plaintiffs, have said that the first judgment was a reaffirmation of how Chevron's greed and criminal misconduct in polluting the region has led to death and disease. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The draft constitution omits a clause in the old document that upheld the Ba'ath Party as the ruling party in the country, an omission that could lead to a multiparty political system. The draft also calls for the democratic election of presidents, who will be limited to two consecutive seven-year terms, and prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion, tribe, race, class, profession or gender. The Preamble to the draft constitution emphasizes the need for peace and describes the proposed constitution as:<blockquote>[A] system of fundamental principles that enshrines independence, sovereignty and the rule of the people based on election, political and party pluralism and the protection of national unity, cultural diversity, public freedoms, human rights, social justice, equality, equal opportunities, citizenship and the rule of law, where the society and the citizen are the objective and purpose for which every national effort is dedicated.</blockquote>The draft constitution arrives as the international community continues to plea for a stop to the violence in Syria. The referendum on the new constitution is set to take place on February 26. 

<p>The growing unrest in Syria has drawn abundant international attention. The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] voted last week to condemn Syria through a non-binding <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-general-assembly-resolution-condemns-syria-violence.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report]. The resolution supported a <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/wcm/connect/5916140049a5bac2a59affcde376ffea/oooo.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=5916140049a5bac2a59affcde376ffea">plan</a> [text, PDF, in Arabic] advanced by the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/portal/en/home_page">Arab League</a> [official website] that aims to bring the situation in the country to a close as quickly as possible by encouraging al-Assad to step down. The same day, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] called on Syria to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">end to violence against civilians and possible crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Ban said that estimates show over 5,000 people have been killed since violence started 11 months ago. Earlier last week, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] called for the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST report] to the International Criminal Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last year that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/us-appeals-court-upholds-university-of-texas-affirmative-action-policy.php">policy did not violate</a> [JURIST report] Fisher's rights to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights statutes, affirming a lower court decision. The appeals court concluded that UT could rely on race as one of the "special circumstances" used to evaluate student applicants because race is one of many factors the university considers.

<p>Also Tuesday the court agreed to hear <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-626.htm">Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, Florida</a> [docket; <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/11-626-petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] to determine whether a floating structure that is indefinitely moored, receives power and other utilities from shore and is not intended to be used in maritime transportation or commerce constitutes a "vessel" under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/3">1 USC &#167; 3</a> [text], thus triggering <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/crm00670.htm">federal maritime jurisdiction</a> [DOJ backgrounder]. The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that it was a vessel.</p>

<p>The court also allocated time for oral arguments in the <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">health care appeal</a> [JURIST report] as follows:<blockquote>On the Anti-Injunction Act issue (No. 11-398), the Court-appointed amicus curiae is allotted 40 minutes, the Solicitor General is allotted 30 minutes, and the respondents are allotted 20 minutes.</p>

<p>On the Minimum Coverage Provision issue (No. 11-398), the Solicitor General is allotted 60 minutes, respondents Florida, et al. are allotted 30 minutes, and respondents National Federation of Independent Business, et al. are allotted 30 minutes.</p>

<p>On the Severability issue (Nos. 11-393 and 11-400), the petitioners are allotted 30 minutes, the Solicitor General is allotted 30 minutes, and the Court-appointed amicus curiae is allotted 30 minutes.</p>

<p>On the Medicaid issue (No. 11-400), the petitioners are allotted 30 minutes, and the Solicitor General is allotted 30 minutes.</blockquote>Finally, the court issued <em>per curiam</em> decisions in two cases. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-38.pdf">Wetzel v. Lambert</a> [opinion, PDF], the court vacated a Third Circuit decision to grant a writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> to a Pennsylvania death row prisoner. In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-391.pdf">Marmet Health Care Center v. Brown</a> [opinion, PDF], the court vacated the decision of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals which had held unenforceable all predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims alleging personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mustapha Suleiman, the head of the five-person prosecution team, said that Mubarak was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/20/world/africa/egypt-mubarak-trial/?hpt=wo_c2">responsible for the killings</a> [CNN report] because he was president at the time and failed to use his power to protect the Egyptian people. The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/egypt-prosecution-begins-case-against-ex-president-mubarak.php">began presenting its case</a> [JURIST report] against Mubarak last month.

The defense is scheduled to give closing remarks on Wednesday, after which Refaat will <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/judge-to-set-verdict-date-in-egypt-expresident-Mubarak-trial-next-week.php">set the date</a> [JURIST report] to announce his verdict.

<p>Mubarak's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">trial started</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011 and has been making slow progress. The trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/egypt-court-resumes-mubarak-trial.php">resumed</a> in December in the Egyptian court after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-adjourns-mubarak-trial-until-december.php">two-month adjournment</a> [JURIST reports] allowing the court time to rule on a motion made by lawyers representing the victims' families to have the three-judge panel in the case removed. The victims' families argued that they were not given enough time to question the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/egypt/tantawi.htm">Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi</a> [GlobalSecurity profile], head of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder], who <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mubarak-trial-suspended-after-former-ally-testifies.php">testified against Mubarak</a> [JURIST report] in a closed session in September 2011, but left early and refused to be cross-examined by counsel of the victims.

HRW released a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia0212ForUpload.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], "No Place for Children: Child Recruitment, Forced Marriage, and Attacks on Schools in Somalia," based mainly on interviews with Somali refugees as well as TFG, UN and <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> [advocacy website] officials. HRW found that <a href="http://www.cfr.org/somalia/al-shabaab/p18650">al-Shabaab</a> [CFR backgrounder; <a href="http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/al_shabaab.html">NCTC backgrounder</a>] has increased its effort to forcibly recruit children since mid-2010. Even when these children succeed in escaping, TFG allegedly detains them for being supporters of al-Shabaab instead of rehabilitating them. While boys are facing death in the battlefield as "human shields," girls are facing cruel treatment of another sort: "Abducted girls are assigned cooking, cleaning, and other domestic duties in the camps. Al-Shabaab uses girls and young women not only for support for combat operations, but also for rape and forced marriage to fighters." Due to al-Shabaab's increased attacks on schools and abduction of children, most of the schools in Somalia are currently closed and those still open provide only below minimum education:<blockquote>Children have nowhere to hide. Al-Shabaab has abducted them wherever they congregate: schools, playgrounds, football fields, and homes. Schools in particular have been attractive targets&#8212;14 of the 21 child escapees from al-Shabaab whom Human Rights Watch interviewed were taken from schools or on their way to school.</blockquote>HRW urged parties to comply with its recommendations including stopping all child recruitment, transferring captured children to rehabilitation centers, protecting schools from attacks and ensuring that officials responsible for abuses be held to account. 

<p><a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2863.htm">Somalia</a> [DOS backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=Somalia+OR+Somali">news archive</a>] on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-sg-welcomes-somalia-constitutional-conference-agreement.php">reached an agreement</a> [JURIST report] at the <a href="http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/2nd_Somalia_National_Constitutional_Conference_opens_in_Puntland_capital.shtml">Garowe II Constitutional Conference</a> [Garowe Online report] to organize diplomats and establish a federal constitution. However, Somalia has been under heavy criticism for human rights violations. In August HRW <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/jurist-human-rights-watch-hrw.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] parties in the Somalia conflict to be involved in abuses of citizens and urged them to cease all of such activities immediately.

In the ruling, Judge Laurie Smith Camp also upheld part of the Fremont law that requires employers to verify the citizenship of workers they hire. Camp concluded that the housing provision violated the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/crt//about/hce/title8.php">Fair Housing Act</a> [text]:<blockquote>It is apparent ... that once the City's legitimate interest in knowing the immigration status of its residents is satisfied, the revocation of occupancy permits does nothing to further that legitimate interest. Accordingly, the "viable alternative means" available to the City to achieve its legitimate policy objectives without discriminatory effects is to stop short of revoking occupancy permits if the immigration status of a resident is verified, whether that status is lawful or unlawful. Accordingly, the Court finds that the enforcement ... of the Ordinance, prohibiting the harboring of illegal aliens, providing for the revocation of occupancy licenses, and providing for certain penalties following the revocation of occupancy licenses, violates the Fair Housing Act.</blockquote> It is unclear if the city of Fremont plans to appeal the ruling.

<p>The city of Fremont <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/nebraska-city-council-suspends-immigration-law-pending-litigation.php">suspended enactment of the ordinance</a> [JURIST report] until the district court decided the issue. In November 2010, the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ne.gov/supreme-court/index.shtml?sub1">Nebraska Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/nebraska-high-court-declines-to-rule-on-local-immigration-ordinance.php">declined to rule on the ordinance</a> [JURIST report]. In August 2010, Camp <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-judge-sends-immigration-law-decision-to-nebraska-high-court.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Nebraska Supreme Court should be the first forum to address the ordinance. In July 2010, the <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/rights-groups-file-suits-against-nebraska-city-immigration-law.php">first lawsuits challenging the ordinance were filed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites]. Fremont voters originally <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/nebraska-city-voters-pass-ban-on-hiring-renting-to-illegal-immigrants.php">passed the ordinance</a> [JURIST report] in June 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Fields</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit categorical rule that all private questioning of prisoners about outside events is <em>per se</em> custodial, requiring Miranda warnings to be given, is not clearly established by Supreme Court precedent. The court also declined to establish a rule that interrogations are <em>per se</em> custodial for the purposes of Miranda, when a prisoner is questioned in private about events occurring outside the prison. Respondent Randall Fields was questioned by investigators about a child sex-abuse case while he was in the county jail serving a 45-day sentence for disorderly conduct. A lower court found that Fields did not have to be given his Miranda rights because the investigators were questioning him about a separate crime. This decision was <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Fields_v_Howes_617_F3d_813_6th_Cir_2010_Court_Opinion">reversed</a> [opinion] by the Sixth Circuit, holding that Miranda is necessary anytime the suspect is isolated from the rest of the jail inmates in a situation where the suspect would be likely to incriminate himself. In an opinion delivered by Justice Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court reversed:<blockquote>In short, standard conditions of confinement and associated restrictions on freedom will not necessarily implicate the same interests that the Court sought to protect when it afforded special safeguards to persons subjected to custodial interrogation. Thus, service of a term of imprisonment, without more, is not enough to constitute Miranda custody.</blockquote>The court further stated that the determination of custody should focus on all features of the interrogation including the manner and language summoning the prisoner to the questioning and the manner in which the interrogation occurs. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed an opinion concurring with the majority as to whether Supreme Court precedent clearly establishes a categorical rule for what constitutes custody but dissented on the issue of whether Fields was in custody for Miranda purposes. Ginsburg was joined in her opinion by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. 

<p>During oral arguments, attorneys representing the state of Michigan <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-error-in-a-death-penalty-case-right-to-counsel.php">argued</a> [JURIST report] that since Fields invoked his right to return to his cell, despite being confined in jail, a reasonable person in jail being taken to an interrogation room would have understood it was an interrogation and Miranda was unnecessary. They further argued against the <em>per se</em> rule that was created by the Sixth Circuit rather than applying the traditional "all the circumstances" test for Miranda. Fields' attorney contended that he felt no freedom to leave and that in a prison or jail situation, a reasonable person would not feel a freedom to leave without being read Miranda rights in that situation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently being held in Italy, five of the suspected pirates will be judged in the criminal division of Rome's Third Circuit Court, the <a href="http://www.tribunale.roma.it/sezioni.aspx?sezione=25">Settore Penale della Terza Corte d'Assise</a> [official website, in Italian] on March 23, while the remaining four will be tried in the Juvenile Court, the <a href="http://www.tribunaledeiminori.it/">Tribunale dei Minori</a> [official website, in Italian], on the same day. The Somalis <a href="http://it.reuters.com/article/topNews/idITMIE81J03320120220">face charges</a> [Reuters report, in Italian] including kidnapping, piracy and possession of weapons for terrorism, and could receive up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Although two Pakistanis were also with the alleged pirates during the attack, they were <a href="http://roma.repubblica.it/dettaglio-news/roma-16:10/12134">released</a> [<em>La Repubblica</em> report, in Italian] based on their testimony to authorities.

<p>The Montecristo was seized on October 10 about 620 miles off the east coast of Somalia while en route to Yemen. Though the nine Somalis took 23 prisoners in the Gulf of Aden, all 23 were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15261734">rescued</a> [BBC report] approximately 24 hours later by US and British troops in a <a href="http://www.manw.nato.int/page_operation_ocean_shield.aspx">NATO Ocean Shield</a> [official website] operation. Similarly, six accused Somali pirates <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/france-to-prosecute-suspected-somali-pirates.php">went on trial in Paris</a> [JURIST report] last November. There, the men were <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/world/europe/france-somali-pirates/index.html">accused</a> [CNN report] of capturing the Carre-d'As IV in the Gulf of Aden in 2008 and holding a French couple hostage for two weeks. This was also France's first piracy trial, with three additional trials excepted to follow. With increasing threats of international <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maritime+piracy">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive], <a href="http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/undpa/main/about/senior_officials">UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Taye-Brook Zerihoun</a> [official profile] urged the international community last October to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-expert-calls-for-increased-efforts-to-combat-somalia-piracy.php">increase efforts to combat Somali piracy</a> [JURIST report] after the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-security-council-resolution-urges-stricter-anti-piracy-measures.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/sc10419.doc.htm">resolution</a> [text] aimed at <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/10/security-council-meeting-somalia-5.html">making piracy a crime and establishing anti-piracy courts</a> [webcast].

On Thursday afternoon, Syrian forces raided the offices of a human rights organization in Syria, arrested 16 people there, blindfolded them and took them to an airport. The UN panel, which included the Special Rapporteurs on human rights defenders, freedom of expression, torture and arbitrary detention, called for the immediate release of all the arrested persons: "The Syrian authorities should end all acts of harassment against human rights defenders and release all those arbitrarily arrested and detained." Juan Mendez, the Special Rapporteur on torture, feared that the arrested persons were at risk of ill treatment at the hands of Syrian forces: "I am deeply concerned about [the sixteen arrestees'] physical and mental well-being particularly in the current context of the ongoing violence in Syria." The raid and arrest occurred on the same day that the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">General Assembly</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-general-assembly-resolution-condemns-syria-violence.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] condemning the violence in Syria.

<p>The growing unrest in Syria has drawn copious international attention recently. Last week, both <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [JURIST reports] called for an end to the violence in Syria, with Pillay asking the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) claimed earlier in February that the past 11 months of violence in Syria have <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">led to the deaths of hundreds of children</a> [JURIST report]. In January, Ban <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the Syrian government end violence against civilians. The OHCHR reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

An immigration judge ordered the deportation of the petitioners, after determining the convictions were "aggravated felonies" within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the decision, which was ultimately <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Kawashima_v_Holder_615_F3d_1043_9th_Cir_2010_Court_Opinion">upheld</a> [opinion] US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In an opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court affirmed:<blockquote>The language of [the statute] is clear. Anyone who is convicted of an offense that "involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000" has committed an aggravated felony and is subject to deportation pursuant to 8 USC &#167; 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The elements of willfully making and subscribing a false corporate tax return, in violation of 26 USC &#167; 7206(1), and of aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return, in violation of 26 USC &#167; 7206(2), establish that those crimes are deportable offenses because they necessarily entail deceit.</blockquote>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg authored a dissenting opinion, in which she was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. The court's ruling resolved a split among the circuits regarding whether filing a false tax return was an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 

<p>During <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-jerusalem-passport-immigration-removal.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report], lawyers for the petitioners argued that filing a false tax return does meet the definition of "fraud or deceit" because the US government does not have to prove any intent to deceive in order to establish that a false tax return has been filed. Several justices were skeptical of petitioners' position that an intentional lie does not necessarily mean an intent to deceive.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The prisoner, Khader Adnan, is a 33-year-old member of the militant group Islamic Jihad who had been refusing food since his arrest in the West Bank in mid-December. He broke his hunger protest when he was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/21/us-palestinian-prisoner-deal-idUSTRE81K0QL20120221">promised to be released</a> [Reuters report] in April if no new evidence is brought against him. A spokeswoman for the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.il/mojeng">Israel Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] confirmed that an agreement was reached and that Adnan will be released April 17. The deal came at a time shortly after Adnan had begun intravenous feeding and was believed to be in deteriorating health. This issue in particular has drawn concern from <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website], which <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/israeli-decision-release-palestinian-detainee-april-insufficient-2012-02-21">called the April release "insufficient"</a> [press release] and urged Israeli authorities to release him immediately to allow proper medical treatment. Adnan's protest is the longest hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee in history.

<p>On Monday the <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Israel Supreme Court</a> [official website] announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/israel-supreme-court-to-hear-prisoner-hunger-strike-case.php">hear Adnan's hunger strike case</a> [JURIST report] despite a military judge rejecting his appeal in early February. The strike began and continued as a protest of Israel's policy of detaining Palestinian prisoners without bringing formal charges or presenting evidence and without a trial. These policies have long been criticized by human rights groups, including AI, which just last week <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/appeals-for-action-Israel-End-use-of-administrative-detention%20">called for the end of administrative detention in Israel</a> [press release]. Earlier this month, <a href="www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] similarly <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-israel-to-end-residency-restrictions.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Israel to amend its policies that forbid Palestinians from traveling through and living in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1042.pdf">Freeman v. Quicken Loans, Inc.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/the-supreme-court-has-a-big-day.php">report</a>] the court heard arguments on whether Section 8(b) of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_12_10_27.html">Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act</a> (RESPA) [text] prohibits a real estate settlement services provider from only charging an unearned fee when the fee is divided between two or more parties. The US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/09/09-30902-CV0.wpd.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the RESPA prohibits only kickbacks and referral fees, not unearned fees by a sole provider of settlement services. Therefore, charges that Quicken imposed on the appellants for loan discount fees and a loan processing fee are not prohibited by Section 8(b) of the RESPA. Counsel for the petitioners argued:<blockquote>For decades, the agency Congress charged with administering the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act has construed that statute as prohibiting a lender from accepting a charge for a real estate settlement service it didn't provide, whether it accepts that charge directly from a consumer or indirectly through another service provider, and whether it shares that fee with another provider or keeps it all for itself. That interpretation is eminently reasonable and is entitled to deference.</blockquote>Counsel for the US government argued as <em>amicus curiae</em> on behalf of petitioners. 

<p>In <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1472.pdf">Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd.</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-adds-7-cases-to-2011-docket.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether translating written documents is enough to be considered an "interpreter" under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001920----000-.html">28 USC &#167; 1920</a> [text] for matters of compensation. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/09-15212.pdf">determined</a> [opinion, PDF] that translating documents is acting as an interpreter under the law. Counsel for the petitioner presented "six categories of authority demonstrating that the work of an interpreter under 28 USC &#167; 1920(6) is limited to spoken communication. Counsel for respondent argued for a broad definition of the word "interpreter."</p>]]></content:encoded>

This bill is a cross-filing of HB438 which was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maryland-house-of-delegates-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/">Maryland House of Delegates</a> [official website] last week. The bill is expected to move to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/maryland-same-sex-marriage-bill-backed-by-senate-panel/2012/02/21/gIQAgeLxRR_story.html">debate by the full Senate</a> [WP report] after the Committee approved the measure with a vote of 7-4. A similar bill was proposed last year in Maryland but <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/maryland-house-fails-to-advance-bill-legalizing-same-sex-marriage.php">failed to pass the House</a> [JURIST report] after it was approved by the Senate. If approved by all parties, Maryland would become the eighth state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow same-sex marriage. <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us/">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/omalley-unveils-agenda-including-same-sex-marriage-bill/2012/01/23/gIQAV8gMMQ_story.html">promised to sign the bill</a> [WP report] once it passes the Senate.

<p>Maryland joins a number of other states working to pass legislation that would allow same-sex couples to marry. Earlier this week, Washington state <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">legalized same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] after Governor Christine Gregoire signed the legislation. New Jersey is also considering legalizing same-sex marriage soon, although it currently has a civil union system in place. Governor Chris Christie conditionally <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/new-jersey-governor-vetoes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">vetoed a same-sex marriage bill</a> [JURIST report] last week and called for a voter referendum to decide the issue, rather than the state legislature. In November, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the Fourteenth Amendment and the New Jersey State Constitution. Same-sex marriage has also been legalized in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The families filed a civil lawsuit against the US and 24 government officials, including former US defense secretary <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [JURIST news archive], claiming they were responsible for arbitrary detention, torture and the death of Al-Zahrani and Al-Salami. Ruling on an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/rights-group-appeals-dismissal-of-guantanamo-suicide-case.php">appeal</a> [JURIST report] brought by the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website], the court held that they lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to the jurisdictional bar created by the <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ366.109.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF]. The court held:<blockquote>that [MCA] deprives this court of jurisdiction over appellants' claims. We further hold that the Supreme Court did not declare [MCA] unconstitutional in <em>Boumediene</em> and the provision retains vitality to bar those claims. We therefore conclude that the decision of the District Court dismissing the claims should be affirmed, although for a lack of jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) rather than for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</blockquote>Al-Zahrani was said to have <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/military-officials-say-guantanamo.php">hung himself</a> [JURIST report] with his bed sheets and clothing.

<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia District</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-judge-dismisses-guantanamo.php">granted the motion for dismissal</a> in Feburary 2010 and later <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/federal-judge-denies-rehearing-guantanamo-wrongful-death-suit.php">denied a motion for reconsideration</a> [JURIST reports] filed after new evidence of eye witness accounts from soldiers suggested the men died while being tortured. The judge denied the reconsideration despite the new evidence saying it does not change the reasoning for dismissal that the "special needs of foreign affairs must stay" the court's action. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/rumsfeld-sued-for-wrongful-death-of.php">claim was originally brought</a> [JURIST report] under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Claims Act</a> [text], which provides that district courts have original jurisdiction to hear claims for torts "committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." The defendants moved to dismiss the suit based on &#167; 7 of the MCA, which removes the ability of federal courts to hear challenges to the treatment of aliens who have been "properly detained" as enemy combatants.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontcourt.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] Judge Clark Waddoups of the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] said Tuesday that he would <a href="/paperchase/2.21.12%20Order.pdf">delay his ruling</a> [order, PDF] on Utah's <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~2011/bills/hbillint/hb0497.pdf">immigration law</a> [HB 497, PDF] until the US Supreme Court rules on the similar Arizona Immigration Law. Waddoups believes that it is in the best interest of the state and the court to <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/53561272-90/law-court-immigration-utah.html.csp">wait until the Supreme Court offers more guidance</a> [<em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> report] on the issue. The immigration bill was originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-governor-signs-package-of-immigration-reform-bills.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] by <a href="http://www.utah.gov/governor/">Governor Gary Herbert</a> [official website] last March. The law has been likened to an <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/DocumentsForBill.asp?Bill_Number=1070&image.x=0&image.y=0">Arizona Immigration law</a> [SB 1070 materials, JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration+law">news archive</a>], which requires police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested for an alleged felony or serious misdemeanor. Waddoups stated that while there were differences between the Arizona and the Utah laws, there are enough similarities to warrant waiting for that ruling to come down:<blockquote>Although Arizona's law is different from Utah's law in several respects, some aspects are sufficiently similar that the Supreme Court's ruling likely will inform this court in its decision. Because this case addresses significant constitutional issues, the court does not believe it would be helpful to the parties for the court to rule on the present motions before it receives the additional guidance from the Supreme Court. It therefore will reserve ruling until the Supreme Court has issued its decision.</blockquote>The Supreme Court's decision on the Arizona law is expected later this spring.

<p>Waddoups <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/federal-judge-blocks-utah-immigration-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> the Utah law in May, less than 24 hours after it took effect, following a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/utah-immigration-law-challenged.php">challenge</a> [JURIST reports] by the <a href="http://www.acluutah.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Utah</a>, the <a href="http://www.nilc.org/">National Immigration Law Center</a> [advocacy websites] and other plaintiffs. The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov//">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] has also <a href="http://extras.sltrib.com/pdfs/DOJcomplaint.pdf">filed suit</a> [complaint, PDF; <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/November/11-ag-1526.html">press release</a>] alleging that clauses in the law are preempted by the federal government's jurisdiction over immigration. The DOJ has filed similar suits challenging immigration laws in <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/doj-files-lawsuit-against-controversial-arizona-immigration-law.php">Arizona</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/doj-challenges-alabama-immigration-law.php">Alabama</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-challenges-south-carolina-immigration-law.php">South Carolina</a> [JURIST reports]. Federal judges have enjoined portions of each of those laws, and an appeal of the Arizona law is currently <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-urges-supreme-court-not-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-appeal.php">pending before the Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report]. The DOJ is reviewing similar immigration legislation passed recently in <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The request comes after a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">voted 2-1 to overturn the law</a> [JURIST report], finding that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell II backgrounder]. The <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/">Protect Marriage Coalition</a> [advocacy website] has <a href="http://www.protectmarriage.com/blog/2012/02/prop-8-proponents-to-appeal-ninth-circuit-ruling-against-traditional-marriage/">alleged</a> [news release] that the decision was at odds with other jurisdictions throughout the country. Asking for the reconsideration blocks the decision from taking effect immediately. The coalition believes that the ruling violates the United States Constitution:<blockquote>The panel majority's ruling that Proposition 8 violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also contravenes binding Supreme Court precedent holding that the traditional definition of marriage does not violate that Amendment. In <span class="casename">Baker v. Nelson</span>, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed, "for want of substantial federal question," an appeal presenting the same question decided by the panel: whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to recognize same-sex relationships as marriages.</blockquote>The appeal will only be accepted if a majority of the 25 judges who sit on the Ninth Circuit agree to review the decision. The next step would be an appeal to the US Supreme Court. Some legal analysts say it is unlikely that the Supreme Court would take the case because the majority opinion focused mainly on California law, not the national standard. 

<p>The Ninth Circuit struck down Proposition 8 earlier this month, ruling that the <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/same-sex-marriage-bans-approved-in.php">voter-approved</a> [JURIST report] constitutional amendment violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution. The Ninth Circuit initially <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-hears-arguments-on-california-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">heard arguments</a> on Proposition 8's constitutionality in December 2010, but then <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">asked the California Supreme Court</a> [JURIST reports] to rule on whether defendants had standing to appeal. The high court ruled in November that they <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/ninth-circuit-seeks-guidance-on-same-sex-marriage-appeal-from-california-high-court.php">did have standing</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hassan assumed power of Maldives when former president Mohamed Nasheed <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maldives-president-resigns-after-protests-over-detained-judge.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] on February 7 following weeks of protests. Nasheed claims he was forced from office in a coup. Supporters of Nasheed took to the streets after his ouster and burned down government buildings in violent demonstrations. The three-member <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/02/22/2654397/maldives-names-commission-to-probe.html">commission was appointed</a> [AP report] by Hassan following criticism from international organizations including the UN.

<p>The Maldives has faced ongoing unrest since January when the military <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-military-arrests-chief-justice-of-criminal-court.php">arrested the chief justice</a> [JURIST report] of the nation's criminal court, Judge Abdulla Mohamed, after he released a detained opposition leader. Last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-maldives-must-release-or-charge-arrested-judge.php">UN called for Mohamed's release</a> [JURIST report] days after the <a href="http://www.foreign.gov.mv/new/">Maldives Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] asked the UN to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-seeks-un-help-to-resolve-detention-of-senior-judge.php">help them resolve</a> [JURIST report] what they called a judicial system failure. The same week, a group of Maldives lawyers <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/maldives-lawyers-seek-icc-intervention-over-detained-judge.php">submitted</a> [JURIST report] the case to the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC?lan=en-GB">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website], calling Mohamed's continued detention a violation of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/disappearance-convention.htm">International Convention on the Protection of all Persons against Enforced Disappearance</a> [text]. In the country's first democratic elections in 2008, Nasheed defeated longtime political opponent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7658672.stm">Maumoon Abdul Gayoon</a> [BBC profile], ending his 30-year rule.

The election was held over three stages from late November to January, and its the elaborate voting system apportioned parliamentary seats between political parties and individuals, with two thirds of the seats going to political parties. Judge Magdy el-Agaty <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL5E8DL92N20120221?sp=true">determined the ratio to be in violation of the constitution</a> [Reuters report], that half of the seats should have been held for individuals. Additionally, Agaty stated that political parties should not have been permitted to field candidates for the seats reserved for individuals. During the elections the political parties reportedly haggled over how many candidates they would field for those seats. It is not clear whether the ruling will lead courts to invalidate the results of the elections, widely viewed as Egypt's freest vote in decades. Agaty has referred parts of the country's election law to the <a href="http://hccourt.gov.eg/About/chairmanword.asp">Supreme Constitutional Court</a> [official website] for a final judgment.

<p>Egypt has been ruled by the military since the <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypt-military-pledges-to-lift-emergency-laws-as-mubarak-steps-down.php">overthrow</a> [JURIST report] of former president <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/12/200912693048491779.html">Hosni Mubarak</a> [Al Jazeera profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">news archive</a>] last February. The new parliament is supposed to name a 100-member council to draw up a constitution, paving the way for presidential elections, but the court's ruling could mire that process and other parliament functions. Last month <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on the newly elected parliament to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/hrw-calls-on-new-egypt-parliament-to-expand-rights.php">pursue an agenda to reform nine areas of Egyptian law</a> </a> [JURIST report] that impede freedom and restrict rights. Meanwhile the prosecution in the case against Mubarak is <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-prosecutor-seeks-death-penalty-for-mubarak-in-closing-remarks.php">seeking the death penalty</a> for the former president, whose trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/egypt-court-resumes-mubarak-trial.php">resumed</a> in December in an Egyptian court after a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-court-adjourns-mubarak-trial-until-december.php">two-month adjournment</a> [JURIST reports] allowing the court time to rule on a motion made by lawyers representing the victims' families to have the three-judge panel in the case removed. The defense is scheduled to give closing remarks this week, after which the judge will <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/judge-to-set-verdict-date-in-egypt-expresident-Mubarak-trial-next-week.php">set the date</a> [JURIST report] to announce his verdict.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In an <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41314&Cr=organized+crime&Cr1">address</a> [UN News Centre report] to the UN <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website], the Secretary-General said he was "particularly concerned about reports stating that terrorist groups, such as Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, have formed alliances with drug traffickers." Additionally, the Secretary-General expressed concern that instability in Libya, a growing food crisis, and other conflicts throughout the region could worsen the situation. According to the Executive Director of the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) [official website], "multi-dimensional and strategic approach that works at the local, national and regional levels" is <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2012/February/executive-director_-west-africa-challenged-by-rapidly-evolving-transnational-threats.html?ref=fs2">necessary to combat these forces</a> [press release] and preserve stability in the region. 

<p>The UN has been involved in efforts to stabilize the West African region following the recent unrest in Libya and the Middle East. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=3543&language=en-US">UN Support Mission in Libya</a> (UNSMIL) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-welcomes-new-libya-electoral-law.php">welcomed the new electoral law</a> [JURIST report] adopted by the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.com/">National Transitional Council </a>(NTC) [official website, in Arabic; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=NTC">news archive</a>]. The draft of the electoral law sets out procedures for the upcoming election to choose a national assembly. This finalization and adoption of the new electoral law is a significant step for Libya in establishing a democratic system after the end of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>] regime and the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libyan conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month, Libya was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-human-rights-chief-addresses-alleged-torture-of-libyan-detainees.php"> criticized for the allegations of torture and human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. Although the NTC expressed its commitment to human rights and legal reformation, UN Security Council was still concerned due to the lack of NTC's control over the revolutionary brigades.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Linda Feinberg in November had allowed the case to continue on the premise that civil unions were unconstitutional under <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/lawsconstitution/constitution.asp">state law</a> [state constitution, text], but <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">dismissed three counts</a> [JURIST report] that claimed violations of federal guarantees of due process and equal protection under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14a_user.html">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Feinberg <a href="http://www.app.com/article/20120221/NJNEWS10/302210064/NJ-judge-reinstates-1-part-gay-marriage-lawsuit?odyssey=nav|head">reversed her dismissal of one count</a> [AP report] after the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration:<blockquote>Defendants challenge the premise that alleged unequal treatment of same-sex couples, under the Civil Union Act, constitutes state action under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause ... Plaintiffs allege the Civil Union Act and its enforcement by certain state officials, who are named defendants, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. At this juncture, the court is satisfied there is sufficient state action to permit the claim under the Federal Equal Protection Clause to proceed.</blockquote>The lawsuit was filed by seven same-sex couples and several of their children, and is expected to ultimately decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court.

<p>The court's ruling came four days after New Jersey <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/governor/">Governor Chris Christie</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/new-jersey-governor-vetoes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">conditionally vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in the state. The <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2012/Bills/A0500/1_I1.PDF">Marriage Equality and Religious Exemption Act</a> [bill, PDF] was passed by the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/Default.asp">New Jersey State Assembly</a> [official website] by a vote of 42-33, and was subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/nj-senate-votes-to-approve-same-sex-marriage.php">approved by the State Senate</a> [JURIST report] 24-16. Approval of the legislation marks a shift from the legislature's previous position concerning same-sex marriage, as a similar bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/new-jersey-senate-defeats-same-sex.php">defeated</a> [JURIST report] in the state Senate last year. Last week the State of Washington became the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">eighth US jurisdiction to legalize same-sex marriage</a>, which is also legal in <a href="/paperchase/2003/11/breaking-news-massachusetts-supreme.htm">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].

The CPJ criticized the growing trend of government censorship, especially Internet censorship. It indicated that imprisonment of journalists has gone up 20 percent worldwide in the last year, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. Among the imprisoned, most face anti-state or censorship charges. The group called for a global movement to end censorship, which it argues threatens the safety of individuals within a country, and strengthens authoritarian governments and criminal enterprises. 

<p>Last May, journalism rights group <a href="http://">Reporters without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/middle-east-leaders-among-annual-list-of-threats-to-press-freedom.php">released</a> [JURIST report] its annual list of <a href="http://en.rsf.org/predator-bashar-al-assad,37213.html">predators of press freedom</a> [materials; <a href="http://en.rsf.org/maghreb-et-moyen-orient-thirty-eight-heads-of-state-and-03-05-2011,40204.html">press release</a>], which included the heads of state of several countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

In a deal brokered by Middle Eastern leaders in November, Saleh agreed to give up power in exchange for receiving immunity from prosecution. Saleh has been in the US since January 29 receiving medical treatment, during which the US has given him diplomatic immunity. In a <a href="http://www.fidh.org/The-United-States-must-fulfill-its">press release</a> [text] on Tuesday, FIDH argued that because Saleh's forces have committed serious human rights violations, Saleh should not be shielded by immunity:<blockquote>International law and conventions stipulate that immunity cannot be granted to perpetrators of grave human rights violations such as torture. As a signatory to the Convention Against Torture and War Crimes Statute, and as a key member of the UN Security Council, the United States has an obligation to investigate the serious and credible allegations of torture and other widespread violations brought against Saleh.</blockquote>The US <a href="www.state.gov">Department of State</a> (DOS) [official website] did not respond directly to FIDH's request to investigate Saleh but did <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/02/184310.htm">issue a statement</a> [text] on Tuesday praising the Yemeni people for electing a new president.

<p>Saleh has been at the center of controversy over the past year. Two weeks ago, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] declared that the US and Arab states are <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-arab-states-not-bound-by-grant-of-immunity-to-yemen-president-hrw.php">not bound</a> [JURIST report] by a decision to grant Saleh immunity. In January, Yemeni officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/yemen-amends-immunity-law-for-salehs-associates.php">amended a law</a> [JURIST report] that would have granted full immunity to Saleh and his aides to limit his aides' immunity to politically motivated crimes. In April, Saleh <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/yemen-president-saleh-agrees-to-step-down-receives-immunity.php">agreed to step down from power</a> [JURIST report] and give control of Yemen's government to his deputies. Last March, the Yemeni parliament, at Saleh's request, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-parliament-approves-emergency-laws.php">enacted emergency laws</a> [JURIST report] designed to end anti-government protests. Earlier in March, Saleh attempted to placate protesters by <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/yemen-president-promises-new-constitution-as-protests-continue.php">promising to create a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] guaranteeing parliamentary and judicial freedoms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Commissioner Karel De Gucht said she hoped the guidance of the ECJ would ease the concerns of European citizens who worry the agreement could lead to censorship. The decision to put ratification on hold comes after a number of European groups <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46479956/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/#.T0Uwr7L0mAI">expressed opposition</a> [AP report]. De Gucht is confident that the ruling of the ECJ will calm these fears:<blockquote>In recent weeks, the ratification process of ACTA has triggered a Europe-wide debate on ACTA, the freedom of the internet and the importance of protecting Europe's Intellectual Property for our economies. ... [L]et me be clear: ACTA will change nothing about how we use the internet and social websites today&#8212;since it does not introduce any new rules. ACTA only helps to enforce what is already law today. ACTA will not censor websites or shut them down; ACTA will not hinder freedom of the internet or freedom of speech. Let's cut through this fog of uncertainty and put ACTA in the spotlight of our highest independent judicial authority: the European Court of Justice.</blockquote>The European Commission unanimously passed the ACTA in December 2011. It must be ratified by the EU national governments to go into effect. 

<p>Recently, there has been a surge in government attention to copyright issues. Last month, the US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] announced it will <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/US-House-postpones-hearing-on-internet-bill-SOPA.php">postpone hearings</a> [JURIST report] on the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) [text, PDF] in the midst of national protest. Also last month, the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-adopts-strict-anti-piracy-law.php">Spanish government approved a new law</a> [JURIST report] that creates a government agency with the authority to force Internet service providers to block certain websites that are involved in pirating copyrighted material. The ECJ ruled in November that <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ecj-rules-isps-not-required-to-monitor-user-activity-for-filesharing.php">ISPs cannot be required by law to monitor</a> [JURIST report] their customers' activities as an attempt to combat illegal sharing of copyrighted material. In October, the US Supreme Court considered the issue of foreign copyrights in the case of <span class="casename">Golan v. Holder</span> when it considered arguments to determine the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-ministerial-exception-uraa.php">copyright status of foreign works</a> [JURIST report] that used to be in the public domain. A judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that a music file-sharing site could be held <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-rules-online-music-site-could-be-liable-for-infringement.php">liable for contributory copyright infringement</a> [JURIST report] in August.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The IACHR issued an injunction urging the Ecuador government to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120222-711422.html">suspend sentencing</a> [WSJ report] until arguments are made by both parties on March 28. <em>El Universo</em> is the second largest newspaper in Ecuador. Two of the four men, Cesar and Nicolas Perez, have already fled to Miami. The lawsuit has been heavily criticized by Correa's opposition.

<p>Last week, Carlos Perez, one of four <em>El Universo</em> managers <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ecuador-journalist-seeks-asylum-from-libel-suit.php">convicted of libel</a> [JURIST report] against Correa, was granted asylum by Panama. The announcement that Carlos Perez had been granted asylum came shortly after Ecuador's highest court, the National Court of Justice, upheld the conviction against the four <em>El Universo</em> managers. The men were sentenced to three years in prison each and fined USD $40 million in total. Correa indicated that he was surprised that Panama granted the men asylum because, in his view, they were common criminals and not persecuted political activists. He also stated on Thursday that he was considering pardoning the men. The <em>El Universo</em> officials stated that they would bring an appeal to the IACHR to fight the verdict. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Independent Living Center of Southern California</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the parties to the suit could return to the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] to argue in the first instance whether Medicaid recipients and providers could maintain Supremacy Clause actions challenging a California state law that reduces reimbursement rates. The court initially <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-opens-2011-term.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] on whether the Supremacy Clause preempts Medicaid recipients and providers from bringing a suit challenging the California statute. Medicaid providers&#8212;doctors, hospitals and pharmacies&#8212;were angered by a series of cutbacks by the California legislature reducing reimbursement payments in an attempt to handle the state's financial crisis. A month after the court heard oral arguments in the case, the <a href="http://www.cms.gov/">Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services</a> (CMS) [official website], the federal agency in charge of administering Medicaid, approved the state statutes as consistent with the federal law. The court indicated that proceeding with a Supremacy Clause action could undermine the review processes delegated to federal administrative agencies under the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/administrative-procedure/">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) [text]. 

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts authored a dissenting opinion, in which he was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Antonin Scalia, saying the Supremacy Clause challenges should have been barred because "[n]othing in the Medicaid Act allows providers or beneficiaries (or anyone else, for that matter) to sue to enforce" the reimbursement provision. The responsibility for enforcing the provision, he concluded, is vested in the CMS. The case is consolidated with <span class="casename">Douglas v. Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital</span> and <span class="casename">Douglas v. California Pharmacists Association</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Montana</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the Montana Supreme Court erred in failing to use a well-settled approach to determine whether the water beds at issue could be considered navigable. <a href="http://www.pplmontana.com/">PPL Montana</a> (PPL) [corporate website], which owns a hydroelectric power dam on the Missouri River, brought the challenge after the state Supreme Court <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/OpBelow.PPlMT_.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the title to the riverbeds passed to Montana when it became a state in 1889 and that the riverbeds are public trust lands under <a href="http://data.opi.mt.gov/bills/mca/Constition/X/11.htm">Article X, Section 11</a> [text] of the Montana Constitution. The Supreme Court of Montana ordered PPL to pay $41 million in back rent and more in future rent for use of the riverbeds. Petitioner PPL argued that the Montana Supreme Court "deviat[ed] from well-settled principles of Federal navigability law" by failing to focus on specific river segments and considering modern instead of historical use of the river. The US Supreme Court agreed with the petitioners. Pursuant to the "equal footing" doctrine, a state gains title to the navigable water beds within its borders and may "allocate and govern those lands according to state law." The court held that, in failing to implement the "segment-by-segment" approach to determining navigability of riverbeds, the Montana Supreme Court reached a decision inconsistent with well-established law.

Mustapha Suleiman, the head of the five-person prosecution team, said that Mubarak was responsible for the killings because he was president at the time and failed to use his power to protect the Egyptian people. Mubarak's <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/mubarak-trial-adjourned-until-august-15-for-health.php">trial started</a> [JURIST report] in August 2011 and has been making slow progress.

Millender</a> [JURIST report] that police officers continue to have qualified immunity if a search warrant is later found invalid. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, noted that the bar set in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/468/897/case.html">United States v. Leon</a> [opinion] is a high standard, where officers cannot be reasonably expected to question a magistrate's writing of a warrant. Roberts stated that the breadth of the search, and the officers following that edict, was not sufficient to defeat qualified immunity:<blockquote>The question in this case is not whether the magistrate erred in believing there was sufficient probable cause to support the scope of the warrant he issued. It is instead whether the magistrate so obviously erred that any reasonable officer would have recognized the error. The occasions on which this standard will be met may be rare, but so too are the circumstances in which it will be appropriate to impose personal liability on a lay officer in the face of judicial approval of his actions. Even if the warrant in this case were invalid, it was not so obviously lacking in probable cause that the officers can be considered "plainly incompetent" for concluding otherwise.</blockquote>In dissent, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued that since the original warrant was issued over a domestic dispute, it was obviously overbroad to command officers to search for guns and gang-affiliation signs, and thus the officers were on notice.

<p>The court declined to reconsider the qualified immunity standard set in <span class = "casename">Leon</span> and <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/us/475/335/">Malley v. Briggs</a> [opinions], which created the current qualified immunity standard. The opinions held that officers are entitled to qualified immunity, and evidence obtained should not be suppressed, so long as the warrant is not "so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable." The court also did not create an exception for lawful gun owners. JURIST Contributing Editor <a href="http://www.stephenhalbrook.com/">Stephen Halbrook</a>, counsel for the <a href="http://home.nra.org/#/home/">National Rifle Association</a> [official websites], argued before the court and in <a href = "/hotline/2011/12/stephen-halbrook-gun-rights.php">commentary for JURIST</a> [JURIST comment] that police infringed on gun ownership rights by seizing guns of all those present without verifying that the suspect was in the area. Police officers entered on a warrant that authorized search for any guns or gang-related material. The plaintiffs also argued that this violated their <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] rights and thus the warrant was invalid and they were allowed to sue for civil damages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Military forces under Syrian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bashar+al-Assad">news archive</a>] have been shelling opposition strongholds in the city of Homs for 20 straight days and reportedly killed more than 80 people on Wednesday, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/middleeast/marie-colvin-and-remi-ochlik-journalists-killed-in-syria.html">two journalists</a> [NYT report]. The UN report, based on 369 interviews with victims, witnesses, defectors and other Syrian insiders, described some of the findings:<blockquote>The commission received credible and consistent evidence identifying high- and mid-ranking members of the armed forces who ordered their subordinates to shoot at unarmed protestors, kill soldiers who refused to obey such orders, arrest persons without cause, mistreat detained persons and attack civilian neighbourhoods with indiscriminate tank and machine-gun fire. In some cases, they gave explicit orders to commit crimes, in others they used more general terms (e.g. use any force necessary) that, in the circumstances, left no room for interpretation. The commission verified that, in some locations, individual army officers ordered the indiscriminate shelling of civilian neighbourhoods in urban areas such as Hama, Al Ladhiqiyah, Dar'a and Homs.</blockquote>The commission of inquiry, headed by Paulo Pinheiro, found that rebel forces led by the Free Syrian Army had also committed abductions and killings, though lesser in scale. The report is a follow-up to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-report-syria-committing-human-rights-violations.php">November report</a> [JURIST report], which had similar findings. An assembly of Western and Arab powers <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/23/us-syria-conference-challenge-idUSTRE81M0UX20120223">plans to challenge al-Assad</a> [news report, Reuters] on Friday to provide humanitarian access to civilians. 

<p>The growing unrest in Syria has drawn international attention. Last week, both UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=navi+pillay">news archive</a>] and UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">called for an end to the violence</a> in Syria, with Pillay asking the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST reports] to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UN Children's Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] claimed earlier in February that the past 11 months of violence in Syria have <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/jurist-the-united-nations-childrens.php">led to the deaths of hundreds of children</a> [JURIST report]. In January, Ban <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-secretary-general-demands-end-to-violence-in-syria.php">demanded</a> [JURIST report] that the Syrian government end violence against civilians. The OHCHR reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiff, Karen Golinski, <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-employee-sues-for-same-sex.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the US Office of Personnel Management for refusing extend health insurance benefits to her same-sex spouse. Judge Jeffrey White ruled that statutory classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to heightened scrutiny and that the legislation was not "substantially related to an important governmental objective." As a result, White concluded that DOMA violated Golinski's right to Equal Protection of the law under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt5afrag1_user.html#amdt5a_hd4">Fifth Amendment</a> [text] to the US Constitution. The court issued a permanent injunction against the defendants ordering them not to impede Golinski's wife from enrolling in the family health insurance coverage.

<p>The district court's ruling is the most recent development in the debate regarding the constitutionality of DOMA and its repeal. The US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-repeal-doma.php">voted to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report] in November, marking the first time a Congressional group has voted to repeal the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage. In a similar case this past October, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-veteran-appeals-benefits-claim-denied-under-doma.php">disabled Navy veteran filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/">Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims</a> [official website] for denying her partner a share of her disability benefits under DOMA. The <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> [official website] allegedly told the veteran she could not receive benefits because her spouse was a woman. In March 2011, congressional Democrats introduced the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">intended to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report], but it has not yet passed. The Congressional action follows an announcement from US President Barack Obama last year that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">continue to fight for the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA, and last year's announcement by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA in court cases challenging the provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-210.pdf">United States v. Alvarez</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on the constitutionality of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000704----000-.html">Stolen Valor Act</a> (SVA) [text]. Xavier Alvarez was convicted under the SVA in 2007 after he announced at a public water district board meeting that he was a retired Marine and had received the Congressional Medal of Honor. His attorney argued that that the law criminalized, at its base, a white lie: "The Stolen Valor Act criminalizes pure speech in the form of bare falsity, a mere telling of a lie. It doesn't matter whether the lie was told in a public meeting or in a private conversation with a friend or family member. And the law punishes false claims to a military award regardless of whether harm results or even is likely to result in an individual case." The Solicitor General argued that the law was narrowly drawn to protect the substantial government interest of upholding the standard of military honors. Since the case came before the court out of a <A href = "/paperchase/2010/08/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors.php">Ninth Circuit decision</a> striking down the law, there has been a <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/tenth-circuit-law-criminalizing-false-claims-of-military-honors-is-constitutional.php">Tenth Circuit decision</a> [JURIST reports] that upheld the law. JURIST assistant editor Kimberly Bennett <a href = "/dateline/2012/02/kimberly-bennett-stolen-valor.php">analyzed the act</a> [JURIST op-ed] and also argued that it is unconstitutional. 

<p>The court also considered <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1320.pdf">Blueford v. Arkansas</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/the-supreme-court-has-a-big-day.php">report</a>] to decide whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Double_jeopardy">Double Jeopardy</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] clause prevents the re-prosecution of a greater offense if a jury deadlocks on a lesser-included offense. Alex Blueford's attorney contends that jeopardy attaches to all of the jury's determinations, even if dead-locked on one. He argued that the foreperson's announcement establishes the verdict, and thus is what jeopardy attaches to. When the foreperson announced Blueford was not guilty on capital murder, it implied not guilty on all charges, even though the jury was dead-locked on first degree murder. He also argued that there was no "manifest necessity" to try on the same charges. The state of Arkansas argued that since the jury was free to re-visit the charges after dead-lock, clearly double jeopardy did not attach. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, filed by the <a href="https://portal.iuoelocal150.org/News%20Room/Local%20150%20News/Pages/default.aspx">International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150</a> [official website], argues that the law is unconstitutional because it violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection</a> [text] clause by treating public employees differently than others. The union claims that the law unfairly mandates that union members pay for representation of workers who choose to opt out of paying union fees. Union workers have gathered in Indianapolis throughout January and early February to <a href="https://portal.iuoelocal150.org/News%20Room/Local%20150%20News/Pages/Members-Descend-on-Indy-to-Protest-Right-to-Work-Passage.aspx">protest against the legislation</a> [press release] which was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/us/indiana-becomes-right-to-work-state.html">signed into law</a> [NYT report] by <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/">Governor Mitch Daniels</a> (R) [official website] on February 1. 

<p>Restrictive collective bargaining laws have been advanced in several states recently. In a public referendum in November, Ohio voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ohio-voters-reject-collective-bargaining-law-in-statewide-referendum.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a bill <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ohio-legislature-passes-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">passed in March</a> [JURIST report] which would have impacted Ohio's 400,000 public workers by limiting their ability to strike and collectively bargain for health insurance and pensions. Ten <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-union-sues-to-block-collective-bargaining-law.php">Wisconsin unions filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in federal court in June challenging the state's new collective bargaining law. According to the plaintiffs, the Wisconsin bill discriminates among groups of public employees and eliminates basic union rights, like bargaining, organizing and associating. In July, a judge for the <a href="https://ecf.idd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Idaho</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-idaho-anti-union-law.php%22">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking the enforcement of an <a href="http://www.legislature.idaho.gov/legislation/2011/S1007.pdf">Idaho anti-union law</a> [SB 1007] that bans a union program that subsidizes employment for its members. The law, called the Fairness in Contracting Act, prohibits union programs used by construction workers unions that pool portions of union wages on a voluntary basis to subsidize union labor to enable union members to be hired at the collectively bargained salary. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Arroyo was formally charged in December with corruption and election fraud during her presidency. She was arrested the day after on a warrant issued for the charges. Arroyo also faces <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/philippines-ex-president-faces-new-charges.php">charges filed in a second criminal complaint</a> [JURIST report] that she approved a $329-million national broadband network deal with the Chinese company <a href="http://wwwen.zte.com.cn/en/">ZTE Corporation</a> [corporate website] in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks in 2008. If Arroyo is convicted she could face life in prison.

<p>Following Arroyo's arrest on charges of election fraud and corruption, she and her husband tried to leave the country after the Philippines Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Philippine-Supreme-Court-allows-ex-president-Arroyo-to-travel-despite-pending-charges.php">allowed them to travel</a> [JURIST report] despite the pending charges, but were denied transit until they received an official copy of the court order.

Under <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=246-869-010">Washington law</a> [WAC &#167; 246-869-010] pharmacies are required to deliver lawfully prescribed medications or devices and to distribute drugs and devices approved by the US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] in a timely manner. Judge Ronald Leighton wrote, "[T]he rules are facially constitutional&#8212;they do not on their face require or permit discriminatory conduct. It is in their operation that the rules force a pharmacy to choose between compliance with the delivery and stocking rules and employing a conscientious objector as a pharmacist." The state argued that the requirements were legal because they applied neutrally to all pharmacies and served a government interest. The pharmacies urged, and the court agreed, that the true goal was to suppress religious objections as evidenced by the secular exemption language in the law. This ruling did not strike down the law, and the <a href="http://www.bendbulletin.com/article/20120223/NEWS0107/202230402/">state remains free to enforce the law</a> [AP report] against violations by other pharmacies.

<p>In 2007, a district court decision <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-blocks-washington.php">blocked the law</a> [JURIST report] ruling that it violated pharmacies' and pharmacists' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights. That decision was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ninth-circuit-upholds-washington-rule.php">overruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 by the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] because the injunction was overbroad.  <a href="http://www.planbonestep.com/">Plan B</a> [product website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=plan+b">news archive</a>] has been the subject of considerable legislative and judicial activity since the FDA approved access to the drug in 2006. Last December, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-revives-lawsuit-over-plan-b-contraception.php">revived a six-year-old lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the Plan B contraceptive. In March 2009, a federal judge in New York <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-orders-fda-to-review.php">overturned an FDA policy</a> [JURIST report] that limited the nonprescription availability of the drug to women over the age of 18. In March 2008, a federal judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a physicians' group against the FDA seeking to overturn approval of the over-the-counter sale of Plan B. In October 2007, Illinois pharmacists <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">considered a settlement</a> [JURIST report] to a dispute over a state law that would have required them to dispense the Plan B pill regardless of their moral objections to the contraception.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new policy, which is scheduled to go into effect on March 1, allows a user's information to be shared among different Google products, including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps. In the letter, the NAAG said they found the new policy "troubling" because it appears to invade consumer privacy without a realistic alternative:<blockquote>Consumers have diverse interests and concerns, and may want the information in their Web History to be kept separate from the information they exchange via Gmail. Likewise, consumers may be comfortable with Google knowing their Search queries but not with it knowing their whereabouts, yet the new privacy policy appears to give them no choice in the matter, further invading their privacy. It rings hollow to call their ability to exit the Google products ecosystem a "choice" in an Internet economy where the clear majority of all Internet users use&#8212;and frequently rely on&#8212;at least one Google product on a regular basis.</blockquote>The letter urges Google to allow consumers to opt out of the new policy, expressing particular concern for Android phone users who use Google products. The NAAG has requested a meeting with Google <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/p/larry_page/index.html">CEO Larry Page</a> [NYT backgrounder] as soon as possible. 

<p>Google's new privacy policy has faced heavy criticism from advocates concerned with consumer privacy. Last week, three US representatives sent a <a href="http://markey.house.gov/sites/markey.house.gov/files/documents/2-17-12%20LTR%20to%20FTC%20Regarding%20Google.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-congressmen-petition-ftc-to-investigate-google-privacy-practices.php">asking it to look into</a> [JURIST report] Google's new privacy policy. Earlier this month, the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website], a consumer privacy group, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/consumer-watchdog-files-suit-to-block-google-privacy-changes.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] asking that the FTC block Google's proposed privacy policy changes. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">Google issued a letter</a> [JURIST report] in response to concerns raised by members of Congress regarding consumer privacy rights as impacted by the new policy. In January, <a href="http://markey.house.gov/">US Representative Edward Markey</a> (D-MA) [official website] and seven other lawmakers sent a <a href="http://markey.house.gov/sites/markey.house.gov/files/documents/2012_0126.Google%20Prviacy%20Letter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Google CEO Larry Page containing <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">11 questions regarding consumer privacy rights</a> [JURIST report] as affected by Google's new privacy policies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The independent tribunal was set up by the Lebanese government to try the suspected perpetrators of the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13978635">Rafik Hariri</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Rafik+Hariri">news archive</a>] and 22 other members of his entourage. The Tribunal is composed of professional judges selected internationally and includes senior members of the Lebanese judiciary. Ban's spokesperson says that this reaffirmation cements the UN's <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41331&Cr=lebanon&Cr1=">continuing support</a> [UN News Centre report, <a href="http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2012/db120222.doc.htm">news release</a>] to help Lebanon find justice from the attacks. The president of the tribunal, Judge David Baragwanath, has previously promised to conclude the STL "as swiftly as fairness allows." The STL has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/prosecutors-urge-lebanon-tribunal-not-to-initiate-trial-in-absentia.php">faced great difficulty</a> [JURIST report] trying to arrest the members of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the believed perpetrators of the attack, where the Iran-backed Shiite militia Hezbollah is the country's most powerful political force. 

<p>Earlier this month the STL announced that it would try four of the accused assassins  <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/lebanon-tribunal-to-try-accused-hariri-assassins-in-absentia.php"><em>in absentia</em></a> [JURIST report], the first time this has happened since the Nuremberg Trials. Those proceedings, however, will not begin for more than four months to allow the defense time to plan. Last August the STL announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-to-investigate-bomb-attacks-related-to-hariri-case.php">investigate three additional bomb attacks</a> [JURIST report] that may be connected to the February 2005 attack that killed Hariri. Earlier that month, the STL <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-unseals-indictment-in-hariri-case.php">unsealed the indictment</a> [JURIST report] against the four individuals accused of the assassination. Also in August the STL president made a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/lebanon-tribunal-urges-suspects-to-turn-themselves-in.php">public plea</a> [JURIST report] for the men to turn themselves in.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill differs from the controversial one <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">passed by the Senate earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] which originally required women to have a transvaginal ultrasound. The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/va-gov-mcdonnell-balks-at-bill-requiring-transvaginal-ultrasounds-for-women-seeking-abortions/2012/02/22/gIQA7ZinTR_story.html?tid=pm_national_pop">controversy surrounding the bill</a> [WP report] has grown in recent weeks and the changes to the bill came at the behest of <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell </a> [official website] who <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/News/viewRelease.cfm?id=1148">requested the non-invasive alternative</a> [press release] in the face of protests from media and pro-choice advocates. The bill is in a perilous place as <a href="http://www.senatorjillvogel.com/">Senator Jill Holtzman Vogel</a> [official website], the bill's sponsor, said Thursday that she would rather strike the bill entirely than allow it to pass with the new amendments. This bill is widely seen as the next step in the process towards outlawing abortions in the state. Also Thursday, the Virginia Senate put on hold <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-house-of-delegates-approves-personhood-legislation.php">personhood legislation</a> [JURIST report] that would define life as beginning at conception.

<p>Virginia is not the first state to pass ultrasound legislation, and similar rules have drawn various results when challenged in the court system. In January, the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-sonogram-law.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas law </a>[JURIST report] that requires women to have a sonogram before undergoing an abortion, allowing the law to be enforced. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina </a>[official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction </a>[JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010, the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In Germany, surgical castration as a means for treatment must be initiated at the request of the offender, be approved by an expert commission and include a medical examination of the requesting offender. The CPT fundamentally objects to the practice, noting: it has irreversible physical effects; surgical castration is not in conformity with recognized international standards; there is no guarantee the result sought will last and, given the context, free and informed consent is questionable. Although it is only applied in a few regions and in isolated cases, the report recommends that the practice be discontinued. The report also includes investigations into the allegations of ill-treatment during custody in police establishments, examinations into conditions of detention for immigration detainees, allegations of inter-prisoner violence and prisoners who were subjected to preventative detention. In <a href="http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/deu/2012-07-inf-eng.pdf">response</a> [PDF], the German federal government states that they are consider the CPT's recommendations.  

<p>Germany and the Czech Republic are the only two European countries that allow sex offenders to choose surgical castration as a treatment option. This month, Russian lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/russia-lawmakers-approve-stricter-sex-offender-law.php">approved stricter sex offender laws</a> [JURIST report] that allow convicted offenders to voluntarily submit to chemical castration. This voluntary procedure was first <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/russia-lawmakers-considering-chemical-castration-bill.php">proposed</a> [JURIST report] last July, but debated by the majority party who wanted the procedure to be mandatory. Several countries including <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/south-korea-enacts-chemical-castration-law.php">South Korea</a> [JURIST report], Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Poland and some US states utilize chemical castration in some capacity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-visits-ivory-coast-to-probe-war-crime-allegations.php">began his investigation</a> [JURIST report] in October, focusing on alleged <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast">post-election violence</a> [JURIST news archive] beginning in 2010. Ocampo requested to expand his investigation in light of evidence that government and rebel forces committed war crimes during an attempted coup in 2002. In its decision, the chamber concluded that there was a reasonable basis for the allegations: <blockquote>The Chamber has referred to events identified by the Prosecutor that are examples of crimes which appear to have been committed against civilians by pro-government and rebel forces in [Ivory Coast], following the 2002 attempted coup. The Chamber has analysed a chronological sample of these incidents, and it has decided whether they potentially amount to a crime or crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court.</blockquote> The court determined the post-election violence of 2010 was a part of ongoing unrest from the 2002 rebellion. 

<p>In December, former Ivory Coast president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">appeared before the Pre-Trial Chamber III of the ICC</a> [JURIST report] for an initial hearing. During the hearing the court verified Gbagbo's identity and ensured that he was informed of the four charges against him, including murder, persecution, inhumane acts, and rape and other forms of sexual violence allegedly committed during last year's post-election violence in the Ivory Coast. Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] in November for his upcoming appearance before the court. In October, Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-visits-ivory-coast-to-probe-war-crime-allegations.php">traveled to the Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations of war crimes committed during post-election violence following the November 2010 elections. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/topstoryphoto/frontechr.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/Homepage_EN">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=901565&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649">ruled</a> [text] that Italy violated international human rights laws when a group of Somalian and Eritrean migrants traveling from Libya were intercepted by Italian authorities and returned to Libya. The court found that Italy violated Article 3 of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/D5CC24A7-DC13-4318-B457-5C9014916D7A/0/ENG_CONV.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] by exposing the migrants to the risk of ill-treatment in Libya and of repatriation to Somalia or Eritrea. Italy argued that Libya was a "safe country" at the time because it complied with its international commitments protecting refugees. The migrants had not expressed a desire to apply for asylum or any other form of international protection, so Italy also argued that they had no oblgiation to provide protection. The ECHR wholly rejected the argument:<blockquote>[D]uring the period in question no rule governing the protection of refugees was complied with by Libya. Any person entering the country by illegal means was deemed to be clandestine and no distinction was made between irregular migrants and asylum seekers. Consequently, those persons were systematically arrested and detained in conditions that outside visitors, such as delegations from the UNHCR, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, could only describe as inhuman. [...] Those same reports clearly show that clandestine migrants disembarked in Libya following their interception by Italy on the high seas, such as the applicants, were exposed to those risks.</blockquote>The court ordered Italy to pay the 24 migrants &#8364;15000 euros each in damages. The court additionally found violations under Article 4, Protocol No. 4's prohibition of collective expulsions, as well as the right to an effective remedy under Article 13. The judgment was <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/4f4619f76.html">welcomed</a> [press release] by the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNRA) [official website] and <a href="http://www.amnesty.it/index.html">Amnesty International in Italy</a> [official website, in Italian], who <a href="http://www.amnesty.it/sentenza-corte-europea-su-respingimenti-in-libia-per-amnesty-international-una-pietra-miliare">called the decision a "milestone" for human rights</a> [press release, in Italian]. 

<p>In September 2009, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/rights-group-claims-italy-libya.php">warning of Italy's potential international human rights violations</a> [JURIST report]. The report found that Italy often intercepts migrants traveling by boat from Libya and fails to screen migrants for potential refugee status before returning them to Libya, thereby violating the European Convention on Human Rights and the principle of non-refoulement. In May 2009, Italy's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/italy-lower-house-approves-bill.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] increasing penalties for illegal immigration, and the government also sent 227 migrants back to Libya without asylum hearings in violation of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html">UN Refugee Convention</a> [text]. In addition to criticism by the UNRA, UN human rights experts have also <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/un-rights-experts-concerned-about-italy.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] for Italy's treatment of detained mirgrants and asylum seekers. The issues raised by HRW's 2009 report were similarly and raised previously in a 2006 report.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The legislation passed by a 25-22 margin in the Senate, having already been <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maryland-house-of-delegates-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">approved by the lower house</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the week. The bill goes next to <a href="http://www.gov.state.md.us/">Governor Martin O'Malley</a> (D) [official website] who has promised to sign it into law. In the build up to the Senate considering the act, <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/blog/?p=4216">O'Malley encouraged</a> [official statement] the Senate to pass the bill: <blockquote>Clergy and faith-based leaders, community leaders, civic organizations, civil rights groups, and citizens from across our State have reached the same conclusion that Americans in seven other states have reached&#8212;it is possible to protect individual civil marriage rights and religious freedom equally.</blockquote> Though the bill is positioned to become law, hurdles remain which might derail the legislation from taking effect. The bill will not take effect until 2013 and may be subject to a popular approval if the groups who are currently fighting the bill are able to obtain 56,000 signatures to force a ballot referendum in November.  To date, no state which has put same-sex marriage as a referendum for popular approval has had a majority of its citizens affirm the action.

<p>Maryland joins a number of other states working to pass legislation that would allow same-sex couples to marry. Earlier this week, Washington state <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">legalized same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] after Governor Christine Gregoire signed the legislation. New Jersey is also considering legalizing same-sex marriage soon, although it currently has a civil union system in place. Governor Chris Christie conditionally <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/new-jersey-governor-vetoes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">vetoed a same-sex marriage bill</a> [JURIST report] last week and called for a voter referendum to decide the issue, rather than the state legislature. In November, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/nj-court-rules-marriage-equality-suit-can-proceed-on-state-grounds.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was allowed to continue in New Jersey, which seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the state civil union law as a contravention of both the Fourteenth Amendment and the New Jersey State Constitution. Same-sex marriage has also been legalized in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Descendants of the genocide victims residing in California brought the suit nearly a decade ago, following the passing of a <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ccp&group=00001-01000&file=350-363">California law</a> [text] in 2000 extending the statute of limitations for unpaid life insurance claims. The Ninth Circuit found 
California Civil Procedure Code &#167; 354.4 <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-california.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] in August 2009 because it interfered with foreign relations by recognizing the World War I-era killings of more than one million Armenians by Turkish soldiers as a genocide. The court <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/ninth-circuit-reinstates-suit-by-armenian-genocide-victims.php">reinstated the suit</a> in December 2010 but decided in November to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ninth-circuit-to-rehear-armenia-genocide-lawsuit.php">rehear the case <em>en banc</em></a> [JURIST reports]. The court held on Thursday that the state law impedes on the federal government's power to regulate foreign affairs:<blockquote>In conclusion, section 354.4 expresses a distinct point of view on a specific matter of foreign policy. Its effect on foreign affairs is not incidental; rather, section 354.4 is, at its heart, intended to send a political message on an issue of foreign affairs by providing relief and a friendly forum to a perceived class of foreign victims. Nor is the statute merely expressive. Instead, the law imposes a concrete policy of redress for "Armenian Genocide victim[s]," subjecting foreign insurance companies to suit in California by overriding forum-selection provisions and greatly extending the statute of limitations for a narrowly defined class of claims. Thus, section 354.4 "has a direct impact upon foreign relations and may well adversely affect the power of the central government to deal with those problems." ... Section 354.4 therefore intrudes on the federal government&#8217;s exclusive power to conduct and regulate foreign affairs.</blockquote>In response to the Ninth Circuit Court's decision, the executive director of the <a href="http://www.anca.org/">Armenian National Committee of America</a> [advocacy website] expressed disappointment and pledged to continue working toward a "principled US policy in support of a truthful, just, and comprehensive resolution of the Armenian Genocide."

<p>The Armenian genocide remains a contentious issue in US law and politics. In August 2010, a panel of the <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-suit-over-armenian-genocide-curriculum.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the exclusion of materials questioning the Armenian genocide from a school curriculum. In March 2010, the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-administration-seeks-to-block.php">announced its opposition to a resolution</a> [JURIST report] labeling the World War I-era killings as genocide. The announcement came after the US House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/house-committee-adopts-armenian.php">passed the resolution</a> [JURIST report] by a vote of 23-22. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Teyyip Erdogan condemned the resolution, and the Turkish government recalled its ambassador to the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kasper-Ansermet took over for Judge Siegfried Blunk who <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-judge-resigns-from-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] in October due to Cambodian political interference with the court. The report recommends that the UN continue to maintain its position supporting Kasper-Ansermet, insist the Royal Govenrment of Cambodia accept Kasper-Ansermet, provide financial and human resources assistance so that Kasper-Ansermet can perform his duties and continue to monitor Cambodia's compliance with the <a href="http://www.unakrt-online.org/Docs/Court%20Documents/Agreement_between_UN_and_RGC.pdf">2003 ECCC agreement</a> [text, PDF].

<p>Kasper-Ansermet is the judge tasked with investigating two possible suspects believed to be involved in the deaths of around 1.7 million people during the reign of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder] regime.

The UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-refuses-to-replace-eccc-judge-in-khmer-rouge-trial.php">refused to replace</a> [JURIST report] Laurent Kasper-Ansermet in January. ECCC judges, including Blunk, have been criticized for allegedly failing to conduct impartial investigations. Cambodia has argued that the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders is a Cambodian issue and should not be a matter of international concern. Also in October, defense lawyers for accused Khmer Rouge leader Nuon Chea <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/khmer-rouge-leader-defense-team-files-suit-against-cambodia-pm.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Cambodian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] for interfering with the UN-backed war crimes tribunal. Nuon's lawyers accused the prime minister of criminally <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/10/24/idINIndia-60088720111024">conspiring to block some of the defense witnesses from testifying</a> [Reuters report] and consequently interfering with his right to a fair trial. In September, the ECCC ordered the trials be <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/cambodia-genocide-tribunal-to-separate-trials-of-khmer-rouge-leaders.php">split into a series of smaller trials</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mubarak's remarks were published in form of a <a href="http://tahrirnews.com/%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D9%88%D9%88%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B9/%D9%86%D8%B5-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%83-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%AF/">memo</a> [text, in Arabic] by <em>Tahrir</em> newspaper on Thursday. Mubarak's remarks to the court became public a day after the defense counsel gave their closing remarks in the trial on charges of conspiracy to <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/eqypt-revolution-resulted-in-at-least-840-deaths-amnesty-report.php">kill at least 840 protesters</a> [JURIST report] during <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%27Egypt+protests%27">demonstrations in Egypt</a> [JURIST news archive]. In his memo, Mubarak emphasized his lifetime dedication and service to the country after the <a href="/thisday/2009/10/egypt-president-anwar-sadat.php">assassination</a> [JURIST report] of former Egyptian president <a href="http://www.anwarsadat.org/">Anwar Sadat</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Anwar+Sadat">news archive</a>]. He continued to stress that he was the one who made sure that the country's national security, sovereignty and independence were established. After elaborating on such accomplishments, Mubarak accused the protesters of having provoked and attacked security officials. He closed his memo by expressing his confidence in the judicial system: "I have spent my life defending them. Hosni Mubarak is not someone to smear his military honor with ill-gotten wealth. Despite everything, I am totally confident in the fairness and justice of the Egyptian judiciary. I am totally confident in history's judgment, and totally confident in the great Egyptian people's judgment&#8212;free from the allegations of the tendentious and those seeking to sow sedition, and those receiving foreign funding." Lawyers confirmed that Mubarak handed a letter to the court during the trial, but the content of the letter is unknown. 

<p>The verdict for Mubarak's case was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-judge-sets-mubarak-verdict-date.php">set for June 2</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday. A day before the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-prosecutor-seeks-death-penalty-for-mubarak-in-closing-remarks.php">prosecution sought death penalty</a> for Mubarak in its closing remarks consistent with their <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/egypt-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-for-mubarak.php">initial announcement</a> [JURIST reports] in January.

The 2-1 decision upholds a <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/bfs/prop69.php">2004 voter-enacted provision</a> [Proposition 69 materials] of the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=295-295.1">DNA and Forensic Identification Database and Data Bank Act of 1998</a> [text] requiring law enforcement officers to collect such samples from arrestees, a mandate challenged by the plaintiffs as a violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt4frag1_user.html">Fourth Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] protections against unlawful search and seizure. Justice Milan Smith, Jr. assessed the constitutionality of the California law under the "totality of the circumstances" test&#8212;whether the government interest in collecting and testing a DNA sample without a warrant outweighs the intrusion on an arrestee's privacy. Smith wrote for the majority:<blockquote>Given the arrestee's diminished privacy interests; the <em>de minimis</em> nature of the physical intrusion entailed in the taking of a buccal swab; the carefully circumscribed scope of the DNA information being extracted; the stringent limits on the manner in which that information may be used; and the well established law enforcement interest in obtaining arrestees' identifying information, and further, to deter future criminal acts and to exculpate innocent arrestees&#8212;the balance of interests tilts strongly in favor of upholding the constitutionality of the 2004 Amendment.</blockquote>The court thus affirmed the lower court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction against the DNA Act.

<p>Last month the <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/?page=550">Minnesota Supreme Court</a> [official website] upheld a state statute requiring people convicted of crimes to submit a DNA sample, similarly ruling that such a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/minnesota-high-court-upholds-mandatory-dna-samples-from-convicted-criminals.php">mandate does not violate the Fourth Amendment</a> [JURIST report] right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. In August a California appellate court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/california-appeals-courts-strikes-down-law-requiring-dna-sample-from-arrestees.php">struck down the 2004 Amendment</a> [JURIST report] to the DNA Act, overturning a misdemeanor conviction for a felon's refusal to provide a DNA sample after confessing to arson. US Attorney General Eric Holder instructed federal prosecutors in November 2010 to <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/holder-calls-for-increased-use-of-dna-evidence.php">use DNA evidence as much as possible</a> [JURIST report], reversing the previous policy of the Bush administration. In May 2009 the US District Court for the Eastern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2009/05/federal-court-upholds-pre-trial-dna.php">upheld the constitutionality of mandatory DNA collection</a> [JURIST report] for all persons arrested or detained under federal authority. In March of that year the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that a South Carolina law requiring convicted first degree sex offenders to submit to a DNA test and pay $250 in processing fees prior to their release <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/fourth-circuit-rules-south-carolina-sex.php">does not violate the ex post facto clause  of the Constitution</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bradley Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22Bradley+Manning%22">news archive</a>] was formally charged with 22 counts, including aiding the enemy, under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text] on Thursday. Manning <a href="http://www.abc2news.com/dpp/news/region/anne_arundel_county_/soldier-defers-plea-in-wikileaks-case">declined to enter a plea</a> [AP report] at the hearing. The maximum penalty Manning faces is life in prison. The government alleges that Manning transferred more than 700,000 confidential documents and video clips to <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a> [website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wikileaks">news archive</a>], the largest intelligence leak is US history. Manning's defense argues that many others had access to his workplace computers in Iraq, he never should have been deployed to Iraq or entrusted with confidential information because he is emotionally troubled since he was barred from openly serving as a gay man, and the leaks did not hurt US national security.

<p>The US military court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-refers-intelligence-analyst's-wikileaks-case-for-court-martial.php">referred Manning's case for court-martial</a> [JURIST report] in February. A <a href="http://www.army.mil/">US Army</a> panel of experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-soldier-charged-with-releasing-classified-documents-deemed-competent-to-stand-trial.php">declared Manning competent to stand trial</a> [JURIST report] in April. Manning's prosecution has sparked heated debate between defenders and critics. Those who support Manning's actions refer to him as <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/manning1/petition.html">courageous for acting as a whistleblower</a> [advocacy petition] against government crime and corruption. He has been compared to famous US whistleblowers such as <a href="http://www.frankserpico.com/">Frank Serpico</a> and <a href="http://www.ellsberg.net/">Daniel Ellsberg</a> [personal websites], who leaked information regarding corruption in the New York Police Department and the Pentagon, respectively. Former Secretary of Defense <a href="http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Robert_Gates">Robert Gates </a>[WP profile] has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704895204575321080522272718.html">criticized the video</a> [WSJ report], claiming it provides the public a view of warfare "as seen through a soda straw." He noted that public attention was not drawn to what was discovered by US ground forces following the helicopter gunfire, including AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. He also said that terrorist organizations are made up of combatants who do not wear enemy uniforms. In August, lawyer <a href="http://charleslugosi.com/index.html">Charles Lugosi</a> [profile] wrote that Patriot Act provisions and criminal sanctions placed on whistleblowers like Manning <a href="/sidebar/2011/08/charles-lugosi-rule-of-law.php">violate the Constitution</a> [JURIST commentary] and fundamentally challenge the legitimacy of the rule of law and American democracy. Lugosi noted that individuals, through websites and social networking, can expose modern injustice and raise the conscious awareness of the public to worthy causes and crusades.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The report documents <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41344&Cr=sexual+violence&Cr1=">numerous conflict-related sexual violence cases</a> [UN News Centre report] in Colombia, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Libya, Myanmar, Somalia and Sudan. Notably the report named for the first time military forces and armed groups suspected of such sexual violence&#8212;organizations like Sudan's <a href="http://www.warchild.org.uk/issues/the-lords-resistance-army?_kk=lord's%20resistance%20army&_kt=a35dea99-cfb1-4fd9-8cb8-847c2ecd7db8&gclid=CIzFs9X8tq4CFeIQNAodzGlaqg">Lord's Resistance Army</a> [War Child profile] and Congo's Federal Republican Forces. According to the report, one of the worst offenders in these regions was the national armed forces of the DRC. In Congo alone a total of 625 instances of sexual violence were reported&#8212;602 against women and 23 against men and boys in the conflict-affected regions of North Kivu, South Kivu and Orientale Province&#8212;and the DRC armed forces allegedly was responsible for almost half (261) of those cases. In the Ivory Coast there has been an increase in rape and gang rape targeting civilians during the country's recent <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Ivory+Coast+election">post-election crises</a> [JURIST news archive]&#8212;between January and September 2011, 478 cases of rape were documented in the country, and although 13 arrests were made, no convictions have taken place to date. While presenting the report in New York Wallstrom stressed that conflict-related sexual violence is a global risk, and that the terror of unarmed women facing armed men is age-old and universal. She added that rape can be a "strategic twist" in times of conflict as a tactic of war and terror, and the report notes that such violence often later acts as an impediment to post-conflict resolutions.

<p>War crimes and conflict-related human rights violations represent an ongoing international concern. On Wednesday an <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Home">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] pretrial chamber granted the request of <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] to expand his <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/icc-expands-investigation-of-war-crimes-in-ivory-coast.php">investigation of war crimes in the Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST report] to incidents dating back to 2002. In April <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged Ivory Coast to <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hrw-urges-ivory-coast-to-investigate-incidents-of-human-rights-violations-war-crimes.php">investigate human rights violations</a> [JURIST report], including murder and rape, that were reportedly committed by opposing political forces last year. In March a military court in Congo <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/drc-military-court-jails-army-officers-for-rape.php">sentenced 11 army officers</a> [JURIST report] to prison for raping more than 20 women in 2010.

The new mandates were promulgated as a result of the recent <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] that was <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/obama-signs-health-care-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] in March 2010. The parties argue that the provision of contraception, sterilization and related services by their insurance companies is in effect a subsidy to those practices which may offend individuals with certain religious beliefs. The complaint contends:<blockquote>[The rule] violates the freedom of speech provided by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution ... because it  compels Plaintiffs to subsidize conduct in violation of their moral and religious beliefs[,] ... violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by negating the right of Plaintiffs to act in accordance with their beliefs [and] ... works a substantial burden on  the Plaintiffs' ability to freely practice their religion, in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</blockquote>In a <a href="http://www.ago.ne.gov/resources/dyn/files/738036ze7fa2985/_fn/022312+Bruning+Files+Religious+Liberty+Suit.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF], Bruning said, "[t]his regulation forces millions of Americans to choose between following religious convictions and complying with federal law. This violation of the 1st Amendment is a threat to every American, regardless of religious faith." Joining Nebraska in the challenge are Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas.

<p>There have been <a href="/timelines/2011/06/health-care-reform-timeline.php">numerous challenges</a> [JURIST timeline] to the constitutionality of various provisions of the PPACA. In January, 26 states submitted a brief to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] challenging the constitutionality of the expansion of Medicaid for the poor and disabled in the PPACA. In November, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">granted <em>certiorari</em> to rule on health care reform law</a> [JURIST report] in three separate cases, originally reserving five-and-half-hours for oral argument on the issue. The Court agreed to hear two hours of arguments on the constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate issue in <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-398.htm">Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-398%20Cert%20Petititon.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF]. The Court will consider Issue 1, which asks, "whether Congress had the power under Article I of the Constitution to enact the minimum coverage provision." The Court also directed parties to brief and argue the question of whether the challenge to PPACA is barred by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_26_00007421----000-.html">Anti-Injunction Act</a> [26 USC &#167; 7421(a)], reserving one hour for argument on that issue. The Court consolidated the cases of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-393.htm">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-393%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-400.htm">Florida v. Department of Health and Human Services</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/PDFs/11-400%20Cert%20Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] and will hear 90 minutes of oral argument on the question of whether the individual mandate provision can be severed from the remainder of the act. Finally, the court will hear one hour of oral argument on the question of Medicaid expansion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law states that all voters must present photo identification at the polls in order to vote in local, state or federal elections. The complaint, filed in the <a href="http://www.wied.uscourts.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=93">US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin</a> [official website], claims that Act 23 violates <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> [text], which "prohibits drawing election districts in ways that improperly dilute minorities' voting power." Plaintiffs argue that:<blockquote>This law will disproportionately injure African-American and Latino voters, who are much less likely than other members of the electorate to possess the required forms of identification and also face disproportionately greater burdens in obtaining such identification. As a result, African-Americans and Latinos are far more likely than other Wisconsin citizens to have their right to vote denied or abridged by Act 23.</blockquote>Plaintiffs are asking the court to find the Act in violation of the Voting Rights Act and award legal fees. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">American Civil Liberties Union</a> [text] and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/womens-group-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">League of Women Voters</a> [JURIST reports].

<p>There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id-state-requirements.aspx">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In August, South Carolina's Senate Minority Caucus <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/south-carolina-sues-federal-government-over-blocked-voter-id-law.php">filed an objection</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], asking it to reject the state's new voter identification law. In June, Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo identification at voting booth. In March, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW's primary concern rests on the short time-frame of the investigation, begun in January 2012 and currently finalizing its findings, as well as reports that it has received that indicate that the investigation has been rushed and may miss important elements:<blockquote>It appears unlikely to have adequately either documented the conflict's serious crimes or identified those responsible on both sides after only a month of investigations. ... In meetings with Human Rights Watch, Ivorian civil society. representatives, United Nations officials, and diplomats highlighted serious problems with the commission. They cited its failure to include representation from pro-Gbagbo groups and to consult sufficiently with civil society.</blockquote>HRW expressed further concern that all 17 members of the investigating commission were chosen by <a href="http://www.ado.ci/">President Alassane Ouattara</a> [official website, in French], the winner of the election.

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/icc-expands-investigation-of-war-crimes-in-ivory-coast.phpf">granted permission</a> [JURIST report] by a pretrial chamber to expand his investigation of war crimes in the Ivory Coast to incidents dating back to 2002. In December, former Ivory Coast president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-appears-before-icc.php">appeared before the Pre-Trial Chamber III of the ICC</a> [JURIST report] for an initial hearing. During the hearing the court verified Gbagbo's identity and ensured that he was informed of the four charges against him, including murder, persecution, inhumane acts, and rape and other forms of sexual violence allegedly committed during last year's post-election violence in the Ivory Coast. Gbagbo was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/icc-takes-former-ivory-coast-president-gbagbo-into-custody.php">taken into custody</a> [JURIST report] in November for his upcoming appearance before the court. In October, Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icc-prosecutor-visits-ivory-coast-to-probe-war-crime-allegations.php">traveled to the Ivory Coast</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations of war crimes committed during post-election violence following the November 2010 elections.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?list=type&type=85">civil suit</a> [case summary] was brought by the <a href="http://www.cja.org/">Center for Justice and Accountability</a> (CJA) [advocacy website] in 2004 against Samantar, who had been living in Washington, DC, for more than 15 years, on behalf of five Somalis under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991</a> [28 USC &#167; 1350 text]. The plaintiff Somalis had been granted asylum in the US after being imprisoned and tortured while Samantar was in office under Dictator Siad Barre. Samantar said he will not contest his legal responsibility but made clear that by doing this he is not admitting guilt. The CJA said this is the <a href="http://www.cja.org/article.php?id=1077">first time</a> [CJA press release] anyone will be held legally responsible for the events that occurred during Barre's regime. 

<p>Samantar appealed his case multiple times, claiming immunity under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-IV/chapter-97">Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</a> (FSIA) [28 US Chapter 97 text] and other common law defenses. Last year, the district court ruled that no immunity privileges under any of theses laws applied. The case made it to the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] in 2010, which <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-foreign-officials-not-immune-from-suit.php">decided</a> that the FSIA did not extend immunities to foreign leaders in civil cases. This ruling overturned the district court's 2007 decision to dismiss the case on grounds that the FSIA granted Samantar immunity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mladic <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/mladic/#pressrel">faces charges</a> [case background] of genocide and crimes against humanity, including murder, political persecution, forcible transfer and deportations, cruel treatment, and the taking of peacekeepers as hostages committed by Bosnian Serb forces under his command during the Bosnian civil war, which saw more than 100,000 casualties and hundreds of thousands more displaced. Mladic continues to deny all 11 chargers. During the <a href="http://hosted2.ap.org/ALDEC/TDWorld/Article_2012-02-23-EU-War-Crimes-Mladic/id-8dfd9463b33d42189093df7a59ef8689">90-minute hearing</a> [AP report], Mladic repeatedly attacked NATO for its involvement in foreign affairs and continually disrupted the hearing until <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/About/Chambers/judges_bios_en/PJ_Orie_Bio_en.pdf">Judge Alphons Orie</a> [ICTY profile] cut off his microphone.

<p>This is the latest controversy in the case against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Mladic">Mladic</a> [JURIST news archive]. Earlier this month, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/icty-delays-mladic-trial.php">further delayed</a> [JURIST report] the beginning of the trial until May 14. In December of last year, a three-judge panel for the ICTY accepted a request brought by prosecutors to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icty-judges-allow-reduced-indictment-against-mladic.php">reduce the number of crimes</a> [JURIST report] they intend to prove against Mladic from 196 to 106. In October, the ICTY prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-prosecutor-not-appealing-refusal-to-split-mladic-trial.php">refused to seek further appeal</a> [JURIST report] of the tribunal's refusal to split Mladic's trial into separate actions: one for his conduct during the <a href="/currentawareness/srebrenica.php">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive], where approximately 8,000 people were killed, and one for all of his other charges during the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bosnian+Civil+War">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archive]. Mladic made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/mladic-receives-month-extension-to-review-charges.php">first appearance</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY in June, contesting the charges while simultaneously asking for more time to review them, which he was granted. Before that, he had <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/serbia-court-rejects-mladic-appeal-of-extradition-to-icty-on-genocide-charges.php">lost his final appeal</a> [JURIST report] in Serbia to avoid extradition and was transported to The Hague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge James Grim <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/us/salvadoran-may-be-deported-from-us-for-80-murders-of-americans.html">found</a> [NYTimes report] that Vides assisted in both the killing of four American women in 1980 and the torture of two Salvadorans during El Salvador's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder]. Although this was not an official order for Vides' deportation, it is a confirmation that the government has the ability to deport him based on charges brought against him by the <a href="http://www.ice.gov/human-rights-violators/">Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Unit</a> [official website] of the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">US Department of Homeland Security</a> [official website].

<p>The Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-seeks-deportation-of-salvadoran-general-for-human-rights-crimes.php">charged Vides</a> [JURIST report] in April with human rights crimes and sought to deport him. He had been living in Florida since the conclusion of his term as defense minister in 1988. In 2006, the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">upheld a $55 million verdict</a> [JURIST report] against him and another former Salvadoran general, Jose Guillermo Garcia, in a civil suit for torture and human rights violations. The verdict had previously been thrown out for failure to file within the 10-year statute of limitations but was reinstated because of "extraordinary circumstances." In 2000, however, the US <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/2-salvador-generals-cleared-by-us-jury-in-nuns-deaths.html?ref=joseguillermogarcia">lost in a jury trial</a> [NYTimes report] when attempting to prosecute Vides and Garcia for the killing of the four American women in 1980. After that case, one juror explained that they did not believe the generals were directly responsible for the killings or that they could have done anything to stop them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The question reads: "Do you favor a law allowing marriage licenses for same-sex couples that protects religious freedom by ensuring no religion or clergy be required to perform such a marriage in violation of their religious beliefs?" Same-sex marriage opponents will have <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-gaymarriage-mainetre81n1qc-20120224,0,257585.story">10 days to challenge the signatures</a> [Reuters report] in an attempt to stop the bill from being placed on the ballot. In 2009, the Maine legislature passed a same-sex marriage bill, but <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-veto-same-sex-marriage.php">voters chose to overturn the measure</a> [JURIST report] by voting in a referendum much like the one planned for November. EqualityMaine now expects that voters will pass the same-sex bill by more than ten percent.

<p>Recently, there has been a nationwide push towards acceptance of same-sex marriage. Earlier this week, the Maryland Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maryland-senate-sends-same-sex-marriage-bill-to-governor.php">passed a same-sex marriage bill</a> [JURIST report], sending it to the governor. Also this week, Washington state <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/washington-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">legalized same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] after Governor Christine Gregoire signed the legislation. New Jersey is also considering legalizing same-sex marriage soon, although it currently has a civil union system in place. Governor Chris Christie conditionally <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/new-jersey-governor-vetoes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">vetoed a same-sex marriage bill</a> [JURIST report] last week and called for a voter referendum to decide the issue, rather than the state legislature. Same-sex marriage has also been legalized in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-york-governor-signs-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">New York</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/massachusetts-house-votes-to-repeal.php">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/connecticut-supreme-court-strikes-down.php">Connecticut</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/iowa-high-court-overturns-same-sex.php">Iowa</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/vermont-legislature-approves-same-sex.php">Vermont</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/new-hampshire-governor-signs-same-sex.php">New Hampshire</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/dc-council-gives-final-approval-to-same.php">District of Columbia</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Berlusconi was on trial for allegedly bribing his British tax lawyer, David Mills, to lie when testifying about Berlusconi and his holding company Fininvest in two trials that took place in the 1990s. Berlusconi, who was in office during most of the five-year-long proceedings, has been accused by some critics of attempting to use the majority he had as Prime Minister to change the law in order to give himself immunity and avoid prosecution. Mills was found guilty in a separate trial of receiving money, but that case was dismissed in 2010 because the statute of limitations had also lapsed.

<p>Berlusconi, who resigned as prime minister in November, has been a defendant in nearly 50 cases. Last week, prosecutors asked a court to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/prosecutors-ask-Roman-court-to-try-expm-berlusconi-for-tax-evasion.php">try him on tax evasion charges</a> [JURIST report]. He is also facing charges of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">publicly releasing private wiretaps</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/berlusconi-appears-in-court-on-fraud-charges.php">embezzlement</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/italy-pm-berlusconi-to-stand-trial-on-abuse-of-power-underage-prostitution-charges.php">paying for sex with an underage prostitute</a> [JURIST reports]. In July, an Italian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/berlusconi-facing-new-trial-on-wiretap-charges.php">ordered Fininvest  to pay &#8364;560 million in damages</a> [JURIST report] and fees to Compagnie Industriali Riunite (CIR) Group. The complaint stemmed from Fininvest's 1991 acquisition of Italian publishing company Mondadori, during which Fininvest bribed a judge in exchange for favorable decisions. In January 2011 the Italian Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-court-holds-hearings-on-immunity-law-shielding-berlusconi-from-trial.php">held hearings</a> and subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/italy-weakens-berlusconi-backed-law-temporarily-providing-immunity-for-public-officials.php">struck down</a> [JURIST reports] portions of a immunity law backed by Berlusconi that would have granted the premier and other public officials temporary amnesty from any charges while holding office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

EPIC brought suit against the FTC <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/consumer-watchdog-files-suit-to-block-google-privacy-changes.php">earlier this month</a> [JURIST report]. The new policy allows a user's information to be shared among different Google products, including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps. EPIC alleged that the changes to the privacy policy were in <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/ftc/google/consent-order.html">violation</a> [EPIC materials] of a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ftc-settles-with-google-on-charges-of-buzz-privacy-violation.php">consent order</a> [JURIST report] between the FTC and Google in October over a breach of consumer privacy rights and misleading consumers during the launch of Google Buzz, a social networking service. US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson stated that the decision to not block the privacy policy changes was within the FTC's discretion and thus not judicially reviewable:<blockquote>[T]he FTC's decision whether to take action with respect to a potential violation of the Consent Order is a quintessential enforcement decision that is committed to the agency's discretion and is not subject to judicial review. ... The FTC is in the best position to evaluate whether Google's new policies will in fact violate the Consent Order, and if so, what course of action the agency should pursue.</blockquote>Because the court ruled that the FTC's decision was not subject to judicial review, it never reached the issue of the merits of EPIC's case against the FTC. The changes to the privacy policy are set to take effect March 1.

<p>Google's new privacy policy has faced heavy criticism from advocates concerned with consumer privacy. On Thursday the <a href="http://www.naag.org/">National Association of Attorneys General</a> (NAAG) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/state-attorneys-general-concerned-about-google-privacy-policy.php">sent a letter</a> [JURIST report] to Google, signed by 36 state attorneys general, expressing concerns about the company's new privacy policy. Last week, three US representatives sent a <a href="http://markey.house.gov/sites/markey.house.gov/files/documents/2-17-12%20LTR%20to%20FTC%20Regarding%20Google.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-congressmen-petition-ftc-to-investigate-google-privacy-practices.php">asking it to look into</a> [JURIST report] Google's new privacy policy. Last month, <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">Google issued a letter</a> [JURIST report] in response to concerns raised by members of Congress regarding consumer privacy rights as impacted by the new policy. In January, <a href="http://markey.house.gov/">US Representative Edward Markey</a> (D-MA) [official website] and seven other lawmakers sent a <a href="http://markey.house.gov/sites/markey.house.gov/files/documents/2012_0126.Google%20Prviacy%20Letter.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to Google CEO Larry Page containing <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">11 questions regarding consumer privacy rights</a> [JURIST report] as affected by Google's new privacy policies.</p>]]></content:encoded>

House Speaker <a href="http://johnboehner.house.gov/">John Boehner</a>, Majority Leader <a href="http://cantor.house.gov/">Eric Cantor</a> and Majority Whip <a href="http://kevinmccarthy.house.gov/">Kevin McCarthy</a> [official websites] of the advisory group are <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-24/news/31096565_1_gay-marriage-ruling-defense-of-marriage-act-marriage-law">pursuing the appeal</a> [AP report]. The advisory group's two Democratic members, Minority Leader <a href="http://pelosi.house.gov/">Nancy Pelosi</a> and Democratic Whip <a href="http://hoyer.house.gov/">Steny Hoyer</a> [official websites], are not joining the GOP members in the appeal.

<p>The district court's ruling is the most recent development in the debate regarding the constitutionality of DOMA and its repeal. The US <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-repeal-doma.php">voted to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report] in November, marking the first time a Congressional group has voted to repeal the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage. In a similar case this past October, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-veteran-appeals-benefits-claim-denied-under-doma.php">disabled Navy veteran filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/">Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims</a> [official website] for denying her partner a share of her disability benefits under DOMA. The <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> [official website] allegedly told the veteran she could not receive benefits because her spouse was a woman. In March 2011, congressional Democrats introduced the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">intended to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report], but it has not yet passed. The Congressional action follows an announcement from US President Barack Obama last year that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">continue to fight for the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA, and last year's announcement by the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] that it will <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA in court cases challenging the provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The gesture towards the opposition by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bashar+al-Assad">news archive</a>] has widely been seen as an empty one, with much of the international community <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j8ZtIxINWSzb9O4Qzc7cNgp0Fchw?docId=2a0535b2428947b490e2810ffd42a1d4">calling it a "sham"</a> [AP report]. The vote comes just one day after reportedly 89 people were killed in Homs, the center of the opposition. The proposed constitution will impose term limits on the president as well as provide for a multi-party system. However, the term limits will theoretically begin once the constitution passes, meaning Assad's previous time in office will not be counted against the term limits. The preamble describes the proposed constitution as:<blockquote>[A] system of fundamental principles that enshrines independence, sovereignty and the rule of the people based on election, political and party pluralism and the protection of national unity, cultural diversity, public freedoms, human rights, social justice, equality, equal opportunities, citizenship and the rule of law, where the society and the citizen are the objective and purpose for which every national effort is dedicated.</blockquote>The new constitution also provides for freedom of speech, press, assembly and association in Articles 42 through 45, which some see as a step in the right direction.

<p>The referendum is an attempt to calm <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Syria">11 months of protests</a> [JURIST news archive] and general opposition to the Assad regime. Activists estimate that more than 7,500 people have died since Assad began cracking down on protesters. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] voted earlier this month to condemn Syria through a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-general-assembly-resolution-condemns-syria-violence.php">non-binding resolution</a> [JURIST report]. The resolution supported a <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/wcm/connect/5916140049a5bac2a59affcde376ffea/oooo.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=5916140049a5bac2a59affcde376ffea">plan</a> [text, PDF, in Arabic] advanced by the <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/portal/las_en/home_page/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gXy8CgMJMgYwOLYFdLA08jF09_X28jIwN_E6B8JG55C3MCuoNT8_TDQXbiNwMkb4ADOBro-3nk56bqF-RGVHjqOioCAKQoUKM!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/">Arab League</a> [official website] that aims to bring the situation in the country to a close as quickly as possible by encouraging Assad to step down. The same day, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] called on Syria to end to violence against civilians and possible <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report].

Tupajic claimed that he was unable to testify because of his health, among other reasons, but the court rejected that idea, saying:<blockquote>The Chamber reviewed the documents the Accused submitted in support of his health concerns but considers that his health concerns do not constitute a just excuse for his failure to comply with the orders as contained in the subpoenas. At trial, in private session, the Accused submitted evidence in relation to other reasons for refusing to appear before the Chamber. The Chamber examined these reasons and considers that they do not constitute a just excuse under <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Rules_procedure_evidence/IT032_Rev42_en.pdf">Rule 77 (A)(iii)</a> [text, PDF] of the Rules.</blockquote>The judgement ended the trial of Tupajic who will be credited with time served against his two-month sentence.

<p>The sentencing comes just days after the court was accused by former Commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1423551.stm">Ratko Mladic</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/mladic.php">news archive</a>], of being <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/accused-war-criminal-yugoslavia-tribunal-biased.php">biased</a> [JURIST report].

In December, the ICTY convicted former Yugoslav intelligence officer Dragomir Pecanac of <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icty-convicts-former-yugoslav-intelligence-officer-of-contempt-for-failure-to-testify.php">contempt</a> [JURIST report] for failing to testify before the tribunal.

Employees of the <a href="http://www.iri.org/">International Republican Institute</a>, the <a href="http://www.ndi.org/">National Democratic Institute</a> and <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/">Freedom House</a> [advocacy websites] are being charged with promoting democracy in the country without proper licenses and using illegally received foreign funding. On the first day of trial, only 14 of the 43 defendants were present, even though it was compulsory that they appear under Egyptian law. None of the defendants from America or Europe was present. In an <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/02/184659.htm">interview</a> [text] Sunday, <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official website] said the US is "working with the highest levels of the existing Egyptian authorities and ... hoping to get this resolved." The <a href="http://www.egyptindependent.com/node/681736">delay</a> [<em>Egypt Independent</em> report] may give the countries involved an opportunity to come to a nonjudicial resolution before the trial starts again.

<p>The employees were <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-ngo-employees-to-face-trial.php">charged earlier this month</a> [JURIST report] after being investigated by Egyptian officials. Investigation into the American workers caused Clinton to <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/us-military-aid-egypt-risk-first-time-decades">threaten to withhold</a> [CNS report] Egypt's annual $1.3 billion military earlier this month. Weeks later, however, President Barack Obama nevertheless made a proposal to Congress to <a href="http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/02/14/194501.html">supply the aid</a> [<em>Al Arabiya</em> report] for fiscal year 2013. Egypt's investigations of NGOs has caused growing strains on US-Egypt relations since January, when the government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/egypt-government-denies-crackdown-on-ngos.php">denied cracking down on NGOs</a> after <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-state-department-egypt-to-halt-raids-on-pro-democracy-groups.php">raiding the NGOs</a> [JURIST reports] in December.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The former governor of Nigeria's oil-rich state is one of the wealthiest, most influential political figures in the country. Ibori was extradited to London to stand trial after British police accused him of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17181056">laundering</a> [BBC report] $250 million during an eight-year period. Before the UK trial commenced, Ibori switched his plea to guilty for laundering money in the UK through off-shore accounts, in order to obtain a better sentence for the charges against him. Two other former governors of Nigeria have been convicted of corruption charges. Sentencing for Ibori is scheduled to take place on April 16.

<p>In October 2010, the <a href="http://www.dubaicourts.gov.ae/portal/page?_pageid=53,72555,53_72567:53_78357:53_338969&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL">Dubai Court of First Instance</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/UAE-court-allows-extradition-of-ex-Nigeria-state-governor-to-UK.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Ibori could be extradited to the UK to face charges of money laundering, fraud and embezzlement. Ibori was arrested in the United Arab Emirates by <a href="http://www.interpol.int/">INTERPOL</a> [official website] in May 2010. Nigeria's <a href="http://www.efccnigeria.org/">Economic and Financial Crimes Commission</a> (EFCC) [official website] accused Ibori of stealing Delta state funds worth $292 million during his time in office. These funds were allegedly filtered through banks in the UK, which led the <a href="http://content.met.police.uk/Home">UK Metropolitan Police</a> [official website] to issue a warrant for his arrest. Ibori appealed the decision to Dubai's Civil Court of Appeal. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Garzon was charged with abusing power by <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/spain-judge-launches-probe-to-create.php">ordering the exhumation</a> [JURIST report] of 19 mass graves in Spain in order to assemble a definitive national registry of Civil War victims, despite a 1977 law that provides amnesty for Franco-era crimes. Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-judge-garzon-defends-franco-era-probes.php">testified in the trial</a> [JURIST report] last month, denying that his investigation was politically motivated, stating that he was seeking justice for the victims of the alleged crimes, and rejecting the idea that the 1977 amnesty law covered widespread human rights abuses. His remarks were consistent with his <a href="/paperchase/2009/09/spain-judge-garzon-defends-2008-franco.php">previous statements defending</a> [JURIST report] the validity of the investigation by insisting that he acted within the bounds of the law and appropriately applied the law at all times. Garzon would have faced up to a 20-year suspension from the bench if he had been convicted, as well as fines. 

<p>Garzon was also charged in two other recent corruption cases. Earlier this month, the Spanish Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/spain-high-court-convicts-judge-garzon-in-wire-tapping-case.php">convicted Garzon of ordering illegal wiretaps in jailhouses</a>, after a trial lasting <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/spain-high-court-begins-first-trial-of-judge-garzon.php">less than one month</a> [JURIST reports]. The court had announced in October that Garzon <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/spain-former-judge-to-face-trial-for-illegal-wiretap-order.php">would stand trial</a> on the charges after the he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/spain-high-court-indicts-judge-garzon-for-jailhouse-wiretap-order.php">indicted in April</a> [JURIST reports] for ordering the placement of wiretaps in jailhouses to record conversations between inmates and their lawyers. Garzon gave the order as part of an investigation into a network of businesses that allegedly gave money and gifts to members of Spain's Popular Party in exchange for government contracts. The court suspended him from practicing law for 11 years. Two weeks ago, the court <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hDYNXbfcqMk2KSzEI4b4eKrFv0Ew?docId=CNG.8cc3903861c91e2e564d291b70c416e4.2e1">dismissed</a> [AFP report] the other case against Garzon, involving bribery charges over money he received for seminars conducted in the US. Garzon is widely known for using <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/international-justice/issues/universal-jurisdiction">universal jurisdiction</a> [AI backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22universal+jurisdiction%22">news archive</a>] extensively in the past to bring several high-profile rights cases, including those against Osama bin Laden and former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Barbier <a href="http://www.upi.com/Business_News/2012/02/27/BP-Gulf-spill-trial-put-off-at-11th-hour/UPI-19931330331400/">adjourned</a> [UPI report] the start of this multi-billion dollar trial after a conference call between the parties a week earlier, in hopes that talks between the parties could produce a settlement. BP could be liable for up to $52 billion in what was the largest accidental oil spill in history, damaging marine life and harming the tourism industry. BP denies gross negligence and urges the court to hold both <a href="http://www.deepwater.com/">Transocean</a> [corporate website] and Halliburton Energy Services Inc. jointly liable for their respective roles as owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig and pourer of the concrete that lined the oil well which was destroyed, causing the oil spill. Both BP and Transocean are defendants in the case. If a settlement is not reached, the trial could span the next two years.

<p>Last month, Barbier issued an <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bp-ordered-to-share-partial-liability-with-transocean-in-oil-spill-claims.php">order</a> [JURIST report] that BP will be held liable for a portion of the damages owed by Transocean stemming from the oil spill. BP will be required to indemnify Transocean against damages created by the pollution itself that are awarded throughout the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/OilSpill/OilSpill.htm">litigation</a> [materials] pending against it. BP will not be required to pay an punitive damages or civil fines as a result of these suits. The court did not rule as to whether BP or Transocean would be held strictly liable, negligent or grossly negligent for the equipment failure and subsequent oil spill that created the pollution. Transocean is the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that was contracted by BP, which subsequently caused the oil spill. This ruling is separate from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-rules-punitive-damages-available-against-BP-in-claims-over-oil-spill.php">ruling issued</a> [JURIST report] by Barbier in August, which permits punitive damages against BP, but that ruling pertained to claims brought against BP directly. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Bashir appealed to the Supreme Court his conviction by the Jakarta High Court, which had <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/indoesia-court-reduces-jail-term-for-radical-cleric.php">reduced his prison sentence from 15 years to nine years</a> [JURIST report], in an effort to be cleared of terrorism charges and released from prison altogether. However, the Supreme Court rejected Bashir's appeal and reinstated the <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/indonesia-cleric-sentenced-to-15-years-in-prison-on-terror-conviction.php">original 15-year prison sentence</a> [JURIST report]. Regarded as a spiritual leader of militant Islam in Indonesia, Bashir is a vocal advocate of violent jihad and was jailed in June for backing a terrorist training camp in the Indonesian province of Aceh. The training camp prepared Islamic radicals to carry out attacks in Jakarta and was allegedly planning attacks modeled after the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=">2008 Mumbai terror attacks</a> [JURIST news archive] and targeting high-profile members of the Indonesian government. Bashir was also accused of providing more than $62,000 to help fund the camp. A spokesperson for the court said Monday that the reinstatement of the stricter sentence shows the court's <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/27/court-rejects-ba-asyir-s-appeal.html">strict treatment</a> [<em>Jakarta Post</em> report] of terrorism convictions.

The <a href="/paperchase/Cambodia-1.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF], "The ECCC- A Failure of Credibility," asserts that the legitimacy of the ECCC is undermined, and, in order to promote international justice, a criticism of the court's failure to meet international standards must be undertaken. Ellis spent a week at the court observing the trials and speaking with individuals. Ellis asserts that both judicial misconduct and interference from the executive are undermining the court's ability to prosecute <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder] leaders and bring justice to victims and affecting the accuracy of the historical record. Ellis wrote:<blockquote>The Cambodian judiciary is not de facto independent from the government. Cambodia has been criticised by the United Nations (UN) for failing to "develop neutral State institutions, checks on executive power, and the means to enforce rights guaranteed in the law and the Constitution". This has resulted in a judiciary that continues to be 'subjected to executive interference and open to corruption'.</blockquote>Thus far, the only former Khmer Rouge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-sentenced-to-life.php">leader to be convicted</a> [JURIST report] by the ECCC is <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/articles/all-you-need-know-about-duch-appeal-judgment">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC materials], also known as "Duch," for crimes against humanity and violation of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">1949 Geneva Conventions</a> [materials]. 

<p>Last week, the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> [advocacy website] reported that the continuing dispute between Cambodia and the UN over the appointment of Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet to the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/cambodia-genocide-tribunals-legitimacy-threatened-by-judge-dispute-rights-group.php">threatens the legitimacy of the court</a> [JURIST report]. Last month, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.shtml">UN</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-refuses-to-replace-eccc-judge-in-khmer-rouge-trial.php">refused to replace</a> [JURIST report] Kasper-Ansermet, the judge tasked with investigating two possible suspects believed to be involved in the deaths of around 1.7 million people, after Cambodia attempted to block him. In October, accused Khmer Rouge leader Nuon Chea <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/khmer-rouge-leader-defense-team-files-suit-against-cambodia-pm.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Cambodian <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/138761.stm">Prime Minister Hun Sen</a> [BBC profile] for interfering with the UN-backed war crimes tribunal. In October 2010, Hun Sen informed the UN that Cambodia will <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/cambodia-pm-rejects-further-prosecution-of-khmer-rouge-officials-by-un-tribunal.php">not allow further prosecutions of low-ranking Khmer Rouge officers</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The protests, which were planned throughout 150 cities on the same day that the council began a four-week session in Geneva, were organized in an attempt to show the country's opposition to Western countries backing the UN resolution which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17176161">calls for an investigation into alleged war crimes</a> [BBC report] committed by both the Sri Lankan government and the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1869501,00.html">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [TIME backgrounder].

<p>Sri Lanka has conducted some independent investigations into allegations of war crimes occurring during the civil war. In December, Sri Lanka's Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission released a report concluding that Sri Lanka's military <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/sri-lanka-report-says-military-did-not-target-civilians.php">did not intentionally attack civilians</a> [JURIST report] following the country's civil war. In November, Sri Lankan Secretary of Defence Gotabaya Rajapaksa stated that the government had begun counting the number of civilian deaths from its 26-year civil war with the LTTE. Also in November, a Sri Lankan army chief was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-former-army-chief-sentenced-to-three-more-years-for-implicating-war-crimes.php">three additional years of imprisonment</a> [JURIST report], for implicating another Sri Lankan official in war crimes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed constitution will impose term limits on the president as well as provide for a multi-party system. However, the term limits will theoretically begin once the constitution passes, meaning President Bashar al-Assad's previous time in office will not be counted against the term limits. Sunday's referendum in which Syrians has been called a "farce" by Western leaders and has been <a href="http://www.independent.ie/world-news/middle-east/sham-syrian-constitution-vote-wins-894pc-approval-3032652.html">condemned</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] as a "sham vote" which cannot be a way of resolving the violence taking place in Syria. Syrian state television announced the approval, along with a report of 57.4 percent voter turnout. Earlier Monday, the EU agreed to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9108814/Sham-Syrian-constitution-vote-wins-89.4-per-cent-approval.html">impose new sanctions on Syria</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report], including an asset freeze of the Syrian Central Bank. EU foreign ministers have also agreed to forbid cargo flights from Syria into the EU and restrict the trade gold and silver between Syria and the EU.

<p>The new constitution <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/syria-holds-constitutional-referendum.php">provides for freedom of speech, press, assembly and association</a> [JURIST report] in Articles 42 through 45, which some see as a step in the right direction. The referendum is an attempt to calm 11 months of protests and general opposition to the Assad regime. Activists estimate that more than 7,500 people have died since Assad began cracking down on protesters. The UN General Assembly voted earlier this month to condemn Syria through a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-general-assembly-resolution-condemns-syria-violence.php">non-binding resolution</a> [JURIST report]. The resolution supported a plan advanced by the Arab League that aims to bring the situation in the country to a close as quickly as possible by encouraging Assad to step down.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay accused the Syrian forces of committing human rights violations and urged the government to stop its escalating violence against civilians. She also asked the government to support humanitarian efforts and justice for victims:<blockquote>I further call upon the Government of Syria to allow independent international monitors to visit all places of detention and grant unhindered access to humanitarian actors. I also call on the Government of Syria to release all political prisoners and persons who have been arbitrarily detained. The Government must launch prompt, independent and impartial investigations in accordance with international standards to end impunity, ensure accountability, bring perpetrators to justice, and to take measures to ensure adequate, effective and prompt reparation for the victims.</blockquote>Syria's UN ambassador, Fayssal al-Hamwi, <a href="http://sana.sy/eng/22/2012/02/28/403143.htm">walked out</a> [SANA report] of the session after Pillay's speech. He said the meeting was not legitimate and accused the international community of arming rebel groups, using economic sanctions to hurt civilians and spreading lies about the Syrian government and the situation in the country. Also on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the French foreign ministry announced that the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/index.html">UN Security Council</a> [official website] had begun <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/28/us-syria-france-urgent-idUSTRE81R0SG20120228">drafting a resolution</a> [Reuters report] aimed at stopping the violence in Syria and promoting humanitarian missions. 

<p>The increasing unrest in Syria has grabbed international attention. Last week, the UN-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria accused the government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-accuses-syria-of-human-rights-violations.php">violating international human rights law</a> [JURIST report] after finding that Syrian forces are engaging in torture and killings under orders from high level government officials. Syrian officials announced Monday that over 80 percent of voters in the country <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/syria-voters-approve-new-syria-constitution.php">approved the new constitution</a> [JURIST report], which imposes term limits on the president and provides for a multi-party system. However, Western leaders called the referendum a "farce" and <a href="http://www.independent.ie/world-news/middle-east/sham-syrian-constitution-vote-wins-894pc-approval-3032652.html">condemned</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] the "sham vote" that cannot be a way of resolving the ongoing violence. Earlier this month, both Pillay and <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">called for an end to the violence</a> in Syria, with Pillay asking the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST reports] to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The OHCHR reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-210.pdf">Elgin v. Department of Treasury</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether federal district courts have jurisdiction over constitutional claims for equitable relief brought by federal employees under the <a href = "http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/complcsra.htm">Civil Service Reform Act</a> (CSRA) [materials]. The petitioners argued that the CSRA was never intended to review constitutional claims, therefore the jurisdiction issue is non-material. The respondents, the Solicitor General's office, argued that the <a href = "http://www.mspb.gov/">Merit Systems Protection Board</a> (MSPB) should determine whether a claim can be heard in district court. The respondents, former federal employees who had failed to register with the Selective Service between the ages of 18 and 26 pursuant to the <a href="http://www.sss.gov/PDFs/MSSA-2003.pdf">Military Selective Service Act</a> (MSSA) [text, PDF], claim that the MSSA discriminates based on sex because it imposes a lifetime bar on federal executive agency employment for violations carried out by a specific group of men. The men resigned or were fired from their federal posts for failure to register. The court did not consider this constitutional issue on Monday.

<p>The court also considered <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-9995.pdf">Wood v. Milyard</a> [transcript, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/supreme-court-adds-7-cases-to-2011-docket.php">report</a>] to decide if the prosecution failing to raise a statute of limitations argument in response to plaintiff's writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> is an error that can be overturned. Further, specific to this case, if the state's assurance to the plaintiff that they would not raise a statute of limitations argument is enough to bind them to not be able to raise it later in proceedings. The petitioner, Patrick Wood's attorney, argued that the state of Colorado had acted strategically in raising to fail the claim and could not be rewarded for this. The Solicitor General of Colorado argued, in response, that the Supreme Court should, "recognize that courts are not bound by a State's failure to properly argue and preserve a procedural bar to a <em>habeas</em> claim; and second, to the extent there is an exception to that rule for deliberate waivers, the court should apply the common rule that a waiver must be unequivocal."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-panel Referral Chamber ordered the transfer so that Rwandan authorities can refer the case to the High Court of Rwanda for trial under Rule 11 bis authorizing the transfer of cases to national jurisdictions. The Chamber further mandated that all case materials concerning the <a href="http://unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/kayishema/indictment/kayishema_fulgence.pdf">indictment</a> [text, PDF] against Kayishema be handed over to the Prosecutor General of Rwanda within 30 days after the decision. Kayishema, former Judicial Police Inspector of Kivumu Commune in Kibuye Prefecture, was charged and indicted <em>in absentia</em> for his involvement in the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>] including genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crime against humanity, but he has remained at large. The Chamber requested that Rwanda regularly report to the ICTR and the International Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals on efforts taken to apprehend Kayishema.

<p>The ICTR's transfer of Kayishema's case to Rwanda is the second such transfer decision within six months. The ICTR previously decided to transfer the case of <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=10498">Jean-Bosco Uwinkindi</a> [Hague Justice profile; <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=75&mnid=1">case materials</a>], a former Rwandan pastor, to the national authorities, but, on Friday, Judge Khan <a href="http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/Case/English/Uwinkindi/decisions/120224.pdf">ordered</a> [text, PDF] that his transfer to be stayed until a suitable monitoring mechanism has been established. In December, the ICTR Appeals Chamber <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/ictr-upholds-decision-to-transfer-case-of-former-pastor-to-rwanda-court.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the decision to transfer Uwinkindi's case.

The report, entitled "'We Are Ordered to Crush You': Expanding Repression of Dissent in Iran," chronicles widespread international human rights violations that Iran's government has allegedly perpetrated over the past year. The AI report claims that the most common targets of Iran's crackdown on human rights are lawyers, rights activists, filmmakers, journalists and political leaders. The report also details the nature of these human rights violations, which include torture and ill treatment in detention, abysmal prison conditions and unfair trials. At the end of the report, AI strongly urges Iran to curtail its crackdown on human rights. In particular, AI requests that Iranian authorities ensure its citizens the rights to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly in the run up to the March 2 parliamentary elections.

<p>Iran has drawn a great deal of international attention recently. Last week, JURIST guest columnist Sasan Fayazmanesh <a href="/hotline/2012/02/sasan-fayazmanesh-iran-sanctions.php">declared</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the latest US sanctions against Iran are part of an escalating trend in American foreign policy that began in the 1980s. Two weeks ago, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] urged Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-calls-for-openness-in-irans-nuclear-program.php">cooperate with international diplomacy efforts on its nuclear program</a> [JURIST report].

<img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://legis.virginia.gov">Virginia Senate</a> [official website] on Monday approved a <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+ful+SB1H1+pdf">bill</a> [SB 1, PDF] requiring identification from those trying to vote in elections. The bill passed 21-20 after an initial 20-20 deadlock that was broken by <a href="http://billbolling.com/">Lt. Governor Bill Bolling</a> [official website]. The bill requires voters to provide:<blockquote>A current and valid photo identification or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter. Such individual who desires to vote in person but who does not show one of the forms of identification specified in this paragraph shall be offered a provisional ballot.</blockquote>The bill goes back to the Virginia House of Delegates to confirm amendments made by the Senate and then to <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official website] who says he is still uncertain if he will sign the bill into law. 

<p>The recent trend of states enacting voter identification laws has been a source of controversy as many opponents feel the laws are intended to dissuade poor or minority voters from participating while others view the requirements as a necessary tool to prevent voter fraud. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.advancementproject.org/home">Advancement Project</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="http://www.advancementproject.org/sites/default/files/publications/WI%20Complaint%20filed%202-23-12.pdf">lawsuit</a> [text, PDF] challenging a <a href= "/paperchase/2012/02/rights-groups-bring-new-challenge-against-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">recent Wisconsin voter ID law</a> [JURIST report]. In August, South Carolina's Senate Minority Caucus <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/south-carolina-sues-federal-government-over-blocked-voter-id-law.php">filed an objection</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], asking it to reject the state's new voter identification law. In June, Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo identification at voting booth. In March, the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Two lawmakers brought the challenge to a parliamentary procedure, which allowed a nine-member parliamentary subcommittee to expedite decisions about lending money in the event of an aid request from the <a href="http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm">European Financial Stability Facility</a> (EFSF) [official website]. According to the court, under the German constitution, legislators have a "comprehensive budgetary responsibility" that requires broad participation when voting on budgetary matters, including aid requests. The court, however, ruled that the subcommittee does have the authority to authorize EFSF's purchase of emergency bonds on the secondary market in the event of a crisis. The court recognized the need for expediency and confidentiality in the purchase of emergency bonds, if the bonds are to have the desired effect of stabilizing a failing economy. In light of the court's ruling, the Bundestag will have to reevaluate the procedure for parliamentary oversight of the EFSF and could decide to grant oversight responsibilities to the 41-member budget committee, rather than the full chamber. The temporary EFSF is scheduled to be replaced by the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu_borrower/efsm/index_en.htm">European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism</a> (EFSM) [official website] this summer, and the Bundestag will likely extend any parliamentary oversight of the EFSF to the EFSM.

<p>In September, the German constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/germany-high-court-rejects-challenges-to-european-stimulus.php">rejected as unfounded</a> [JURIST report] three constitutional complaints against German and European legal instruments and other measures in connection with both the European Monetary Union rescue package and the financial aid package for Greece. The high court <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg11-055en.html">ruled</a> [press release] that by voting through national acts that implement the broader European measures, the Bundestag did not unconstitutionally impair its own ability to adopt and control the nation's budget, nor did it infringe on the budget autonomy of future parliaments. In May 2010, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/german-high-court-rejects-temporary-injunction-for-greece-bailout-funds.php">refused to issue a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report]  against the German government's &#8364;22.4 billion ($28.5 billion) contribution to the bailout package for Greece, which has been gripped by a dire <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8508136.stm">debt crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] and faces severe <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/greece-parliament-approves-austerity-measures.php">austerity measures</a> [JURIST report] as it grapples with its debt. The court held that the complainants seeking the injunction did not produce any concrete evidence that their rights under Germany's Basic Law could be "seriously and irreversibly" affected as a result of the guaranteed loan. The court's press release also noted that potential liability risk as a result of the contribution is outweighed by reducing the risks of damaging Germany's national economy as a result of instability of the European Monetary Union.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Five states <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/michigan-4-other-states-seek-supreme-court-ruling-on-asian-carp.php">petitioned the court</a> [JURIST report] in October asking them to overturn a lower court ruling and to require the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/Pages/default.aspx">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official websites] to accelerate a study on ecological separation as well as installation of nets to stop the advancement of <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greatlakes/invasive/asiancarp/">Asian carp</a> [EPA backgrounder] toward Lake Michigan. The current study on how to keep the invasive Asian carp from crossing between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi river is <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20111026/NEWS06/111026026/Schuette-again-files-Asian-carp-appeal-Supreme-Court?odyssey=tab%7Ctopnews%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE">expected to take five years</a> [<em>Detroit Free Press</em> report]. Some experts have indicated the invasive species could consume enough plankton to disrupt the food chain, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/states-asian-carp-case-supreme-court-14820157">damaging the multi-billion dollar fishing industry</a> [AP report]. A spokesperson for the Attorney General of Michigan indicated that they believe the court <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-asian-carp-supreme-court-20120228,0,4890020.story">reached the wrong conclusion</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] and that, as a result, the carp could be getting closer to the Great Lakes.

<p>In August, the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-block-invasive-fish-from-great-lakes.php">ruled against</a> [JURIST report] the five states' efforts to stop the Asian carp. The Supreme Court has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/26/asian-carp-supreme-court_n_551798.html">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [AP report] on the issue three times as of April 2010. In December 2009, the state of Michigan filed a <a href="/paperchase/2009/12/michigan-sues-illinois-in-supreme-court.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the Supreme Court against the state of Illinois seeking to close the two waterways, as the court has original jurisdiction in disputes between the states. All three times, the court denied <em>certiorari</em> without comment on the dispute. Michigan reopened the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/ag/12-21-09_Carp_Fact_Sheet_305177_7.pdf">longstanding controversy</a> [backgrounder, PDF] over the diversion canal, created in the 1890s to keep Chicago's sewage from flowing into Lake Michigan. The court issued decrees over the canal in 1930, 1933, 1956, 1967 and 1980. The carp have been traveling up the Mississippi and Illinois rivers for years. Tests have showed that the carp may have gotten through an underwater electric barrier and may now be within six miles of Lake Michigan. The fish were originally imported to control algae in fisheries on the Mississippi River, but escaped during a 1990s flood.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ultimately, the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gjHYCt_QXpx0BCVzrFBTzPmu8KPA?docId=23b55cbb45294c648812ffa6bc2a9434">Council found</a> [AFP report] that the law's provisions allowing the imposition of a &#8364;45,000 fine, a one-year prison sentence, or both, on those who deny the genocide violates various free speech safeguards within France's founding documents, namely the <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/cst2.pdf">Constitution of France</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/constitution/constitution-of-4-october-1958.25742.html">Declaration on Human and Civic Rights</a> [text, PDF]. Turkish <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.tr/ahmet-davutoglu.en.mfa">Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu</a> [official profile] welcomed the ruling and added that Turkey's foreign affairs cabinet would meet to consider whether to restart economic, political and military contracts with France, which were temporarily gridlocked because of the genocide denial ban. In an official <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/president/les-actualites/communiques-de-presse/2012/communique-de-la-presidence-de-la-republique.13037.html">statement</a> [text, in French], French <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [official website, in French] ordered his government to draft a revised version of the law, noting that the court's decision was met with "great disappointment and profound sadness" by its proponents. "The President of the Republic considers that [genocide] denial is intolerable and must therefore be punished," read the statement, which was released by the president's office.

<p>Despite one <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/france-senate-panel-rejects-genocide-denial-ban.php">Senate committee's rejection</a>, France's genocide denial ban was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/france-senate-passes-genocide-denial-ban.php">passed</a> [JURIST reports] by both the <a href="http://www.senat.fr/">Senate</a> and the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">National Assembly</a> [official websites, in French] in mid-January.

The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-house-passes-watered-down-abortion-ultrasound-bill.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://legis.state.va.us/">Virginia House of Delegates</a> [official website], and is a scaled-back version of a similar <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?121+sum+SB484">bill</a> [text] that was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion">passed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. The current version of the bill removes the requirement for a transvaginal ultrasound to be performed, but continues to require a traditional transabdominal ultrasound. The bill retains the requirement that the women be provided with information regarding the gestational age and physical development of the fetus. In addition to altering the ultrasound requirements, the updated legislation redacts the portion of the previous version that would have required the medical professional to give the woman the option of listening to the fetal heart tone. The contentious bill was narrowly <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?121+vot+SV0711HB0462+HB0462">approved</a> [results] by a margin of 21 to 19, with the vote split relatively along party lines.

<p>Virignia is not the first state to pass such legislation, and similar rules have drawn various results when challenged in the court system. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-sonogram-law.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas law</a> [JURIST report] that requires women to have a sonogram before undergoing an abortion, allowing the law to be enforced. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010 the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposal, entitled the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/articles_publications/publications/echr-factshees-20120227/echr1-brighton-20120227.pdf">Brighton Declaration</a> [text, PDF], began circulating to member states last week. It is expected to be voted on in April when members states meet to discuss the future of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/ECHR/homepage_en">European Court of Human Rights</a>  (ECHR) [official website]. The proposal <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17201024">calls for a number of amendments</a> [BBC report] to the convention with the most notable allowing the court to issue advisory opinions. Additionally, the would allow nations greater leeway in applying the court's decisions on their citizens. This proposed amendment is directly in line with a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/uk-top-judge-national-courts-not-bound-by-europe-rights-court.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] by the UK's highest judge in October that found ECHR decisions are not binding. Due to the controversial nature of the amendments, unanimous approval from all 46 member states must be received before the proposal can go through. The government's actions were not unexpected, though, because members of the government have promised for years to use the rotation of the court's presidency as a platform for reform. 

<p>Earlier this month a UK think tank <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-urged-to-withdraw-from-europe-rights-court.php">urged the country to withdraw</a> [JURIST report] from the ECHR altogether in favor of a national high court. Tensions between the court and the country have been high for years due to the UK's lack of agreement with some of the court's rulings. In 2005 the court found that <a href="/paperchase/2005/10/british-prisoners-may-be-given-right.php">British prisoners should be given the right to vote</a> [JURIST report]. The ECHR and the UK have also clashed over the issue of extradition of terror suspects. In February 2011 the UK government's independent reviewer of terror laws <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/uk-terrorism-expert-criticizes-European-court-rulings-on-control-orders.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] saying that rulings from the ECHR made it difficult to remove foreign terror suspects from Britain. The ECHR refused to grant the government's request that a terror suspect be required to show that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to ill-treatment. The ruling lowered the suspect's burden of proving that he would be faced with ill-treatment upon returning to his home country. In July 2008, the ECHR <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/europe-rights-court-blocks-extradition-of-terror-suspects-to-us.php">stayed the extradition of four terrorism suspects</a> [JURIST report] from the UK to the US, holding that potential punishment could violate Convention's provisions on the prohibition of torture and inhumane or degrading treatment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

In <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-1491.pdf">Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">report</a>], the court heard arguments on whether three oil companies are immune from US lawsuits under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute of 1789</a> (ATS) [text] for alleged torture and international law violations that took place overseas. International law does not address corporations in defining who can be sued for human rights abuses. While accepting that international law is the proper authority to define human rights violations, the petitioners, Nigerian plaintiffs suing foreign-based oil companies, argued that domestic US common law should fill in the blank in ATS over who could actually be sued for such atrocities. The US government sided with the petitioners, with Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler providing the additional argument that international law does not independently foreclose foreign corporate liability the way that it immunizes a foreign government from liability for official wrongdoings. The respondent oil companies argued that international law is wholly controlling in such a situation and that domestic US common law has no bearing on the proceedings. Respondents pressed the fact that not only does international law not recognize corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses, but the world community has never recognized corporate liability for the misdeeds of individuals: "No other nation in the world permits its court to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection." While the issue in the case was supposed to focus on "the narrow issue of whether a corporation can ever be held liable for violating fundamental human rights norms under the Alien Tort Statute," the court frequently pushed petitioners on the specific point of whether Congress intended ATS to permit suits by aliens against aliens for overseas acts.

<p>The court also heard arguments for a similar case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-88.pdf">Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority</a> [transcript], in which the court will decide whether political organizations including the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization are immune from liability under the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.R.2092.ENR:#">Torture Victims Protection Act of 1992</a> (TVPA) [text]. As in <span class="casename">Kiobel</span>, the plaintiffs in this case allege human rights violations against an entity other than an individual person. The TVPA allows lawsuits to be brought in US courts against "any individual who, under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation" subjects another individual to torture. The petitioners argued that, unlike <span class="casename">Kiobel</span>, there is no issue as to whether "Congress expressly created the cause of action at issue in a statute" because "in every single other Federal court statute that Congress has ever enacted, it has provided for organizational liability." Respondents argued that the petitioners' argument is merely an "attempt to inject ambiguity into what is a very unambiguous term in US legal usage by referring ... to a supposed subtle definition of 'individual' in international law." Respondents argued that "individual" is not a term of art with specialized meaning in international law that would differentiate its usage is US law, and that Congress was proceeding incrementally in enacting liability under the statute, limiting its reach short of imposing secondary liability on a class of institutions such as political organizations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new maps were issued after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rejects-interim-texas-redistricting-maps.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Texas's interim redistricting maps in an <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-rule-on-texas-redistricting-plan.php">emergency appeal</a> [JURIST report] filed to challenge an interim map drawn up by the US District Court for the Western District of Texas. The Supreme Court rejected the initial interim maps, finding that, "it is unclear whether the District Court for the Western District of Texas followed the appropriate standards." State <a href="https://www.oag.state.tx.us/index.shtml">Attorney General Greg Abbott</a> [official website] released a <a href="https://www.oag.state.tx.us/oagnews/release.php?id=3985">statement</a> [press release] calling the new maps a "substantial improvement" and stating that the "new interim maps more accurately reflect the decisions of elected Texas legislators" as per the requirement of the Supreme Court. The new maps clear the way for the Texas primary election which has been delayed twice. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/us/final-texas-redistricting-maps-approved.html">tentative date for the primary has been set</a> [NYT report] for May 29, but, if there is an appeal of the new maps the date could be pushed back once again. 

<p>According to the 2010 census, Texas' population grew by 4.3 million, which gave it four more seats in the US House of Representatives. The Republican-controlled state legislature redrew the congressional districts in a way that challengers claim would make it more likely for Republicans to win those new seats. The plan must be approved by either the Justice Department or a federal court under Section 5 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder], and the Obama administration has objected to the plan. In the meantime, the federal court in Texas drew an "interim map" for use in the 2012 election. That is the map that was challenged before the Supreme Court. The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-texas-legislature-redistricting-maps.php">reject the interim maps</a>, and the court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-texas-redistricting-case.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in the case last month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Per his plea bargain, Khan must testify against fellow "high value" prisoners who are alleged to have been involved in the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">9/11 terrorist attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. The list of detainees against whom Khan will testify includes <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12964158">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> [BBC profile], one of the alleged designers of the 9/11 attacks, and others who are also believed to have been involved.

Khan is set to be sentenced in 2016, giving him time to testify at other military trials. This is the first agreement offered to a Guantanamo detainee that guarantees freedom in exchange for testimony.

<p>Khan was charged with war crimes, including murder, attempted murder, spying and providing material support for terrorism. Before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006, both <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/guantanamo-detainees-father-says-son.php">Khan's father</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/terror-suspect-subjected-to-state.php">Khan's lawyer</a> [JURIST reports] claimed in 2007 that the detainee had been subject to "state-sanctioned" torture while being held in secret CIA prisons.

It is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egyptian-judges-withdraw-from-trial-of-16-american-pro-democracy-workers-cite-uneasiness/2012/02/28/gIQA5QebgR_story.html">not clear why the judges chose to withdraw</a> [AP report], but Egyptian lawyer and rights activist Ahmed Seif al-Islam suggested it could be a result of political pressure. The case, tried in a Cairo Criminal Court, involves individuals that have been <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-ngo-employees-to-face-trial.php">charged with promoting democracy</a> [JURIST report] in Egypt without proper documentation and through the use of illegal funds. The suspects, including 16 Americans, 27 other foreigners and Egyptians, are employees of NGOs that advocate democracy in Egypt. The case has strained Egypt's relationship with the US. Earlier this month, US Ambassador to the UN <a href="http://usun.state.gov/leadership/c31461.htm">Susan Rice</a> [official profile] called on Egypt to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72494.html">release the suspects</a> [Politico report], and US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/c27775.htm">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] threatened to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/05/us-egypt-ngo-usa-idUSTRE8140PX20120205">reconsider the $1.3 billion in annual aid</a> [Reuters report] given to Egypt. On Wednesday, however, Clinton said she believed the issue would be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/29/us-egypt-usa-clinton-idUSTRE81S1G120120229">resolved in the near future</a> [Reuters report]. An Egyptian court official said Tuesday that new judges will be assigned to try the NGO case. If convicted, the suspects face up to five years in prison.

<p>The Egyptian government has faced criticism recently for its persecution of NGO employees. On Sunday, A Cairo Criminal Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-court-adjourns-trial-of-ngo-employees-until-april.php">adjourned the trial until April</a> [JURIST report] following the first day of the trial. None of the defendants from America or Europe was present for the first day of trial. In an <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/02/184659.htm">interview</a> [text], Clinton said the US is "working with the highest levels of the existing Egyptian authorities and ... hoping to get this resolved." Earlier this month, Egyptian investigative judges <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-ngo-employees-to-face-trial.php">referred the NGO case to a criminal court in Cairo</a> [JURIST report]. In January, the Egyptian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/egypt-government-denies-crackdown-on-ngos.php">denied cracking down on NGOs</a> [JURIST report] amid accusations by various human rights groups that Egypt was trying to silence the military council's vocal opposition. In December the Egyptian government <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-state-department-egypt-to-halt-raids-on-pro-democracy-groups.php">agreed to cease its raids of NGOs</a> [JURIST report], after the US expressed concern about Egypt's approach toward NGO activity. Egyptian police <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/29/us-egypt-groups-idUSTRE7BS0PT20111229">raided the offices of 17 pro-democracy and human rights groups</a> [Reuters report] in December, citing foreign funding as a main concern.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Egyptian security officials detained al-Adel upon his arrival after noticing that his name appeared on the passenger list on a flight from Pakistan. Before he was taken away for questioning, however, al-Adel contended that Egyptian officials had <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17204128">mistaken his identity</a> [BBC report], and that he was not the al Qaeda official that authorities sought. Doubts have since emerged over whether the man detained on Tuesday is actually al-Adel. The <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Backchannels/2012/0229/Mistaken-identity-Top-Al-Qaeda-leader-Saif-al-Adel-probably-not-arrested-in-Cairo">reported</a> [text] that the man arrested by Egyptian officials was probably an Egyptian militant who shares a similar alias to al-Adel. al-Adel has been on the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/saif-al-adel/view">FBI Most Wanted Terrorists Lists</a> [materials] since 1998 for his connection with the August 7, 1998, bombings of US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. The US <a href="www.state.gov">Department of State</a> [official website] is offering a five million dollar reward for his capture.

<p>In September a CIA drone strike in Yemen <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">killed senior al Qaeda leader</a> [JURIST report] and US citizen <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Awlaki">news archive</a>]. The strike marked the US government's most successful attack against al Qaeda since the raid leading to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan last May. In June <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/al-qaeda-operative-suspected-in-us-embassy-bombings-killed-in-somalia.php">al Qaeda operative Fazul Abdullah Mohammed was killed</a> [JURIST report] by security forces at a checkpoint in Somalia. Mohammed was on the <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/saif-al-adel/view">FBI Most Wanted Terrorists Lists</a> [materials] for his involvement in the 1998 US embassy bombings. Al-Adel, who has also gone by the alias Mohammed Ibrahim Makkawi, has drawn a great deal of international interest since the US embassy bombings.

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.01433:">Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2012</a> [materials] would effectively overturn the 2005 US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] decision in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html">Kelo v. City of New London</a> [text], authored by retired justice John Paul Stevens. The <span class="casename">Kelo</span> case drew sharp criticism, particularly from Republicans who believed the court disregarded the traditional standard for "public use." The proposed act would prevent states from seizing private property for the purpose of economic development and create a private cause of action for property owners. The act reads:<blockquote>No State or political subdivision of a State shall exercise its power of eminent domain, or allow the exercise of such power by any person or entity to which such power has been delegated, over property to be used for economic development or over property that is used for economic development within 7 years after that exercise, if that State or political subdivision receives Federal economic development funds during any fiscal year in which the property is so used or intended to be used.</blockquote>The White House has remained silent regarding its position on the proposed legislation, and the Senate has yet to decide whether to consider the act.

<p>The power of the government to take private property and convert it into public use is a doctrine long held. States can enact limitations on government takings to further citizen protections flowing from the Fifth Amendment. In November, Mississippi voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state constitution <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mississippi-voters-pass-ballot-initiative-restricting-eminent-domain.php">limiting the power of eminent domain</a> [JURIST report] in the state. The approved measure would prohibit, with certain exceptions, state and local government from conveying acquired private property to other persons or private businesses for a period of 10 years after acquisition. In 2010, voters in Nevada <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/nevada-voters-reject-eminent-domain-ballot-measure.php">rejected a ballot initiative</a> [JURIST report] that would have expanded state power by defining five exceptions to an existing general prohibition against exercising eminent domain to transfer property from one private party to another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Railroad Friction Products Corp.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the federal <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode49/usc_sec_49_00020701----000-.html">Locomotive Inspection Act</a> (LIA) [49 USC &#167; 20701] preempts state-law design-defect and failure-to-warn claims because these claims fall within the field of locomotive equipment regulation preempted by the act. The petitioner, George Corson, contracted mesothelioma and passed away after working as a welder and mechanic on the braking system of trains which contained asbestos. Corson had <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-preemption.php">urged the court</a> [JURIST report] to construe the LIA narrowly as applying to the safety of locomotives in use on railroad lines and not applying to hazards to mechanics conducting repairs. The court relied on its decision in <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/272/605/case.html">Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.</a> [text] to hold that the petitioner's claims were preempted pursuant to the field preemption doctrine, which applies "when the scope of a [federal] statute indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively." The court rejected the petitioner's arguments that the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (FRSA) altered the LIA's preemptive scope and that the failure-to-warn claim could prevail even if the design-defect claim was preempted.

<p>Justice Elena Kagan, in her concurring opinion, concluded that the design-defect and failure-to-warn claims were preempted by the LIA because "<em>Napier</em> recognized the federal agency's delegated authority over "the design, the construction and the material of every part of the locomotive."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, and was joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Though they agreed that the design-defect claim was preempted by the LIA, they concluded that the failure-to-warn claim was not preempted because the field defined in <span class="casename>Napier</span> related only to the "physical composition of locomotive equipment." Kagan, Sotomayor, Breyer and Ginsburg also agreed that the court might decide <span class="casename">Napier</span> differently today because recent cases have regularly rejected the field preemption doctrine when statutory language does not contain an express preemption clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Indianapolis</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">report</a>] on tax equality under the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Equal Protection clause</a> [text] of the Constitution. In Indianapolis, a tax scheme was changed mid-project, and several residents were forgiven the remainder of their balances on that tax. The petitioners, a group of citizens who paid their taxes in full, argued that this amnesty program violates the Fourteenth Amendment: "The fact that an arbitrary classification may yield a desirable result does not render it any less arbitrary. The city must have a reason for drawing the distinction; but paying one's taxes in good faith does not equal treatment." The city argued that it was good public policy to forgive the remainder of taxes when they switched plans: "[S]ometimes things that make policy sense that the public likes also make good government sense." The city continued that an interest in making public policy that pleases people is rational enough that the classification should not be seen as arbitrary.

<p>Indianapolis <a href = "http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=139844">assessed a property tax</a> [SCOTUSBlog report] on citizens in a certain residential area to fund a new sanitation project in 2001. Residents were given the option of paying the $9,278 tax in full, or paying it in increments over several decades. Several paid in full, while others paid considerably under the installment plan. In 2005, the city decided to revise the tax policy to fund the plan, and forgave the remaining balances on all of the residents. This put many in the position where they had paid above the new $2,500 fee for the sanitation project. The city government refused to refund those taxes, but property owners were refunded in a private suit. They then pursued litigation against the forgiveness policy that had allowed other property owners to pay below the initial tax.

The resolution calls for the Syrian government to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/TheHRCcallsSyrianGovernmenttoimmediatelyendattacksoncivilians.aspx">immediately end attacks on civilians</a> [press release]. The measure was affirmed with 37 nations voting for the proposal while three voted against and three other nations abstained. The UNHRC urged the Syrian government to:<blockquote>"Immediately put an end to all human rights violations and attacks against civilians, to cease all violence, to allow free and unimpeded access by the United Nations and humanitarian agencies to carry out a full assessment of needs in Homs and other areas, and to permit humanitarian agencies to deliver vital relief goods and services to all civilians affected by the violence."</blockquote>The resolution comes as Syrian forces under <a target="_blank" href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2007/07/200852518514154964.html">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [Al Jazeera profile] continue an eleven month long siege on its own citizens which has escalated of late. The number of casualties has spiked as government forces have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17223472">closed in on Baba Amr</a> [BBC report] which has been the principle stronghold of the Syrian rebel force.

<p>The official condemnation from the rights body comes on the heels of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-immediate-cease-fire-in-syria.php">demand for a cease-fire</a> [JURIST report] by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] earlier this week. Syrian officials announced Monday that over 80 percent of voters in the country <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/syria-voters-approve-new-syria-constitution.php">approved the new constitution</a> [JURIST report], which imposes term limits on the president and provides for a multi-party system. However, Western leaders called the referendum a "farce" and <a href="http://www.independent.ie/world-news/middle-east/sham-syrian-constitution-vote-wins-894pc-approval-3032652.html">condemned</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] the "sham vote" as incapable of resolving the ongoing violence. Last month, the UN-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria accused the government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-accuses-syria-of-human-rights-violations.php">violating international human rights law</a> [JURIST report] after finding that Syrian forces are engaging in torture and killings under orders from high level government officials. Also in February, both Pillay and <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">called for an end to the violence</a> in Syria, with Pillay asking the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST reports] to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The OHCHR reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March. The increasing unrest in Syria has garnered international attention and has sparked controversy in America about <a href="/forum/2012/02/amos-guiora-syria-intervention.php">what its role should be</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiffs contend that the contested portions of the legislation violate the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] right to commercial free speech.
Judge Susan Bolton applied the commercial speech test to determine whether the legislation was an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech and concluded that the legislation was unlawfully restrictive:<blockquote>The Court finds that Defendants have not shown that A.R.S. &#167; 13-2928(A) and (B), which are content-based restrictions of speech, are drawn to achieve the substantial governmental interest in traffic safety. As an initial matter, because the regulation is content-based and applies only to solicitation of employment, not other types of solicitation, it appears to be structured to target particular speech rather than a broader traffic problem. The adoption of a content-based ban on speech indicates that the legislature did not draft these provisions after careful evaluation of the burden on free speech.</blockquote>Bolton ordered that, because the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits of their case and would suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, injunctive relief was appropriate. Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> [official website], in a <a href="http://www.azgovernor.gov/dms/upload/PR_022912_DayLaborer.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF] released after the order was handed down, contended that the portions of the legislation related to day laborers was a "necessary traffic safety measure." 

<p></p>

<p>The District Court's ruling is part of a long line of challenges to SB 1070. Since SB 1070's passage, similar laws have been passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-legislature-approves-new-version-of-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports]. Even though SB 1070 has influenced the passage of similar laws in other states, it has attracted sharp criticism. Attorneys for Brewer filed a brief with the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] in February, asking the court to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/arizona-files-opening-brief-with-supreme-court-on-immigration-law.php">lift an injunction</a> [JURIST report] that has blocked several provisions of SB 1070 from taking effect. In December, the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether Arizona's controversial immigration law is <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">preempted by federal law</a> [JURIST report]. In November, the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-urges-supreme-court-not-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-appeal.php">urged the Supreme Court not to hear Arizona's appeal</a> [JURIST report] of a decision enjoining four provisions of SB 1070. The Supreme Court in May ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that Arizona's <a href="http://www.azag.gov/LegalAZWorkersAct/">controversial employment related immigration law</a> [materials] is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">not preempted</a> [JURIST report] by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).</p>]]></content:encoded>

The regulation mandating nine new warning signs, initially set to take effect in September 2012, was deemed a violation of the tobacco companies' First Amendment rights. Rather, Judge Richard Leon suggested less restrictive alternatives to the warnings to convey the repercussions of smoking to the public. His suggestions include increasing anti-smoking advertisements, raising cigarette taxes, improving efforts to prevent unlawful sale to minors or changing display requirements. In his ruling, Leon wrote: <blockquote>This Court is acutely aware of  the health risks of  smoking. And although the Government may want  to convince consumers to stop smoking to protect their health, plaintiffs are correct in stating that their industry should not "serve as the government's unwilling spokesman in that paternalistic endeavor."</blockquote>The ruling follows a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/federal-judge-blocks-new-tobacco-label-requirements.php">preliminary injunction</a> issued by Leon last November, which is currently being <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/fda-to-appeal-order-blocking-new-tobacco-warning-label-requirements.php">appealed</a> [JURIST reports] by the FDA. The FDA is also expected to appeal Wednesday's decision.

<p>US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text] into law in 2009, granting the FDA certain authority to regulate manufactured tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients. The proposed implementation of new tobacco warning labels has also drawn criticism abroad. In Australia, Philip Morris has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] to block <a href="http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-label-images#.T0-TLnKXT5g">new graphic warning label requirements</a> [AUS Health Dept. backgrounder] recently enacted in that country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, passed in a vote of 102-65, would prohibit most abortions performed beyond five months of pregnancy except in situations where continued pregnancy would affect the life or health of the mother. The legislation is premised on the <a href="http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2012-02-29/house-passes-bill-ban-abortions-after-5-months-pregnancy">controversial notion that a fetus begins to feel pain</a> [AP report] at approximately 20 weeks of gestation. Opponents of the legislation argue that such a law would disproportionately affect poor women who could not afford to travel out of state to receive abortion services. Representative <a href="http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2009_10/house/bios/cooperSharon/cooperSharon.htm">Sharon Cooper</a> (R) [official profile] expressed concern that women would be forced to carry a badly damaged fetus that has no chance of surviving outside of the womb to term. In voicing her opposition to the bill, Cooper, a nurse, said that "[m]aking a mother carry that child to term is cruel and inhumane punishment." HB 954 goes to the <a href="http://www.senate.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx">Georgia State Senate</a> [official website], and, if it passes there, Georgia would become the sixth state to impose such an abortion restrictions based on the notion that a fetus can feel pain. 

<p>Laws restricting access to abortions have been passed in other states recently. In August 2011, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union </a>(ACLU) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-challenges-kansas-abortion-insurance-law.php">filed a lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] challenging a Kansas <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/hb2075/">law</a> [HB 2075 materials] that prohibits insurance companies from including coverage for abortion in their comprehensive plans. In July 2011, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ksd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Kansas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-abortion-law-requiring-licenses-for-clinics.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] to block a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/sb36/">regulation</a> [SB 36 materials] requiring clinics within the state to obtain a license to perform abortions. In April 2011, Kansas Governor <a href="https://governor.ks.gov/">Sam Brownback</a> (R) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/kansas-governor-signs-abortion-restriction-legislation.php">signed two pieces of legislation</a> [JURIST report] restricting abortions in the state. The <a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2035_enrolled.pdf">Abortion Reporting Accuracy and Parental Rights Act</a> [HB 2035, PDF] requires unemancipated minors to obtain notarized parental signatures before an abortion may be performed, and the "<a href="http://kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/year1/measures/documents/hb2218_enrolled.pdf">fetal pain bill</a>" [HB 2218, PDF] restricts abortions beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the belief that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of gestation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 94-page report details alleged <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/02/28/bahrain-hundreds-railroaded-unjust-trials">due process violations</a> [press release] in both civilian and military courts. The report is based on information obtained from interviews with more than 50 defendants, lawyers and witnesses to the proceedings. It also includes recommendations to the government of Bahrain, the UN, western countries and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website]. The report urges Bahrain to conduct its own investigation into the actions and hold the guilty accountable. Additionally, the report requests that the country stop convicting people asserting their rights of freedom of expression, assembly and association. According to HRW, the Bahrain government should:<blockquote>Withdraw all charges and expunge all convictions lodged since February 2011 in the National Safety Courts or civilian courts based on the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and all convictions based solely on confessions [and] release immediately all individuals who have been detained or convicted solely for the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. [Additionally, they should] terminate ongoing prosecutions and not institute future prosecutions against any individual based solely on the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. </blockquote>In early February King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa stated that Bahrain did not have any political prisoners and that the only people arrested were criminals. 

<p>In response to a <a href="http://files.bici.org.bh/BICIreportEN.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released in November by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">detailing human rights violations</a> [JURIST report], Al Khalifa swore that reforms would be made. Al Khalifa promised last month to amend the nation's <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Kingdom_of_Bahrain_(2002)">constitution</a> [text] to allow the <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.bh/Default.aspx?tabid=140&language=en-US">National Assembly</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bahrain-king-announces-constitutional-reforms.php">more oversight of ministers and cabinet members</a> [JURIST report]. In early February, a Bahraini court overturned the death sentences for two protesters convicted of killing two police officers during the demonstrations that took place in the country last year. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/bahrain-protesters-sentenced-to-death-over-police-killings.php">original conviction</a> [JURIST report] was rendered by a special security court set up as part of the emergency law in place while the country's Sunni rulers attempted to silence a Shiite-led to effort bolster civil and political rights in the country. In December, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said that the Bahrain government should <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-bahrain-government-should-release-protestors-rebuild-trust.php">release prisoners detained during peaceful protests</a> [JURIST reports] and focus on rebuilding national trust in the government. Pillay's statement followed a visit by a team of human rights officials to Bahrain at the invitation of the Bahrain government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit was filed by the <a href="http://elcaminowellnesscenter.com/">El Camino Wellness Center Collective</a> [website; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/elcaminowellnesscenterfanpage">Facebook page</a>], a Sacramento dispensary and a medical marijuana user. The plaintiffs relied on a 2009 <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cts=1330626236508&ved=0CCwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justice.gov%2Fopa%2Fdocuments%2Fmedical-marijuana.pdf&ei=ur5PT-nsIILi0QHrteTUDQ&usg=AFQjCNFbZuBt1wh5jT2hdcGqZ4Crm2SLzw&sig2=EYkVrqkAli4JIDUTIYDRCw">memorandum</a> [text, PDF] from the Deputy Attorney General directing all US attorneys to <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">avoid allocating resources to the prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of "individuals whose actions are in clear and unambiguous compliance with existing state laws providing for the medical use of marijuana." In his order, Judge Garland Burrell ruled that the memorandum was not legally enforceable. In a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/elcaminowellnesscenterfanpage/posts/308935902493980">statement</a> [text] on its Facebook page, the El Camino Wellness Center said they were disappointed with the court's decision and they planned to appeal. This lawsuit is one of four similar suits filed in California after US Attorneys in the state announced their intent to prosecute medical marijuana dispensaries. 

<p>Federal courts have been cracking down on state medical marijuana laws recently. In January, a federal judge in the <a href="http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/index.htm">US District Court for the District of Montana</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-court-rules-montana-medical-marijuana-law-does-not-shield-providers-from-federal-prosecution.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's medical marijuana law does not protect providers of the drug from federal prosecution. Earlier in January the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-judge-grants-aclu-motion-to-dismiss-arizona-medical-marijuana-challenge.php">granted a motion to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by the Arizona Governor. The governor argued an Arizona medical marijuana law placed lawmakers at risk of federal prosecution for implementing the law. In October, medical marijuana advocates <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/california-marijuana-advocates-file-suit-against-federal-government.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] in a California federal court seeking relief against the federal government for its crackdown on marijuana dispensaries in the state. In June, a judge in Ontario <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ontario-appeals-court-stays-marijuana-possession-ruling.php">stayed a ruling</a> [JURIST report] finding that the country's marijuana laws were unconstitutional. In January 2010, the <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/supremecourt.htm">California Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/california-supreme-court-rejects.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a 2003 law limiting the amount of marijuana that may be possessed under the state's <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/MMP/Pages/Medical%20Marijuana%20Program.aspx">Medical Marijuana Program</a> (MMP) [materials].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In reversing an <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/washington/wawdce/2:2011cv00119/173119/55/">injunction</a> [text] by the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Washington</a> [official website], the Ninth Circuit upheld budget cuts responsible for eliminating the benefits provided by the state program <a href="http://foodhelp.wa.gov/basic_food.htm">Basic Food</a> [official website], asserting that "States constitutionally can do precisely what Washington did here: provide supplemental benefits when the state's coffers bulge, but eliminate them when the state's resources diminish." Plaintiff Monica Pimentel, a legal immigrant and mother of three, argued that the state's decision to terminate the food assistance program violated the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell University backgrounder] of the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment14/">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text], but to no avail. In rejecting the argument, the court reasoned that Washington denied Pimentel "benefits that it did not and still does not grant to citizens and other aliens." Rather, distinguished the court, those citizens and other aliens receive help from a program that lies "firmly in the hands of the federal government," and federal benefits have no bearing on how a state chooses to distribute the funds it receives.

<p>Washington terminated the Basic Food program in February 2011 due to budget constraints, effectively cancelling state benefits for more than 10,000 households. Qualified citizens and non-citizens, however, continued to receive federal food stamp benefits under the <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program</a> (SNAP) [official website]. Though the federal program has always provided assistance for both citizens and non-citizens, the federal government in 1996 cut benefits for non-citizens and required that they meet a number of additional prerequisites to qualify for aid, including a five-year residence requirement. In response, Washington compensated by providing state food benefits to legal immigrants who no longer qualified under SNAP. Originally enacted as the <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/rules/Legislation/pdfs/PL_88-525.pdf">Food Stamp Act</a> [text, PDF], Washington has participated in the program by distributing federal benefits to citizens and non-citizen residents since its inception in 1964.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With signing the bill the governor <a href="http://www.governor.maryland.gov/blog/?p=4554">released</a> [official press release] the following statement:<blockquote>For a free and diverse people, ... for a people of many faiths, ... for a people committed to the principle of religious freedom, ... the way forward is always to be found through greater respect for the equal rights of all; for the human dignity of all. Religious freedom was the very reason for our State's founding. At the heart of religious freedom is the freedom of individual conscience. If there is a thread that unites the story of our people, it is the thread of human dignity; the dignity of work; the dignity of family; the dignity of every child's home; the dignity of every individual. We are One Maryland, and all of us, at the end of the day, want the same thing for our children: to live in a loving, stable, committed home protected equally under the law.</blockquote>
Opponents of the bill are planning and expected to meet the state's low threshold for signature-gathering to petition to overturn the new measure on the upcoming November ballot. 

<p>The Maryland same-sex marriage law was passed more quickly than other states that have enacted similar laws. Maryland's <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maryland-senate-sends-same-sex-marriage-bill-to-governor.php">Senate approved</a> [JURIST report] the bill in a 25-22 vote last week after it was approved by the Senate <a href="http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/05sen/html/com/05judp.html">Judicial Proceedings Committee</a> [official website] the same week in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maryland-senate-committee-approves-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">vote of 7-4</a> [JURIST report] and by the <a href="http://mlis.state.md.us/">Maryland House of Delegates</a> [official website] the week before in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/maryland-house-of-delegates-passes-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">vote of 72-67</a> [JURIST report].

Rajapaksa is accused of human rights violations in connection with the country's civil war against the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> [JURIST news archive]. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly stated that there were "shocking allegations of human rights abuses and violations of United States and international law" but that Rajapaksa is nonetheless entitled to immunity as a foreign head of state. The US <a href="http://www.state.gov/">Department of State</a> [official website] filed a memorandum arguing that Rajapaksa was immune from suit. The plaintiffs argued that the TVPA holds anyone, including heads of state, liable for torture and killings, but the judge held that there is no indication that Congress intended to overrule the longstanding common law principle of head of state immunity when it passed the TVPA.

<p>In November the Sri Lankan government announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Sri-Lanka-investigating-civilian-casualties-from-civil-war.php">begin investigating civilian casualties resulting form the civil war</a> [JURIST report].

Also that month, a former Sri Lankan army chief was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-former-army-chief-sentenced-to-three-more-years-for-implicating-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to an additional three years in prison for his comment to a local newspaper that the government of Rajapaksa ordered the killing of surrendering rebel leaders during the civil war and therefore, was in breach of Sri Lanka's emergency laws effective at that time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A three-judge panel unanimously rejected the defendant's challenge to the prosecution's use of evidence obtained through cell phone numbers collected by police at the arrest scene. Although each phone's number was later used to subpoena months of phone records, the court held the collection of the numbers constituted a permissible search, likening a cell phone to a diary:<blockquote>If police are entitled to open a pocket diary to copy the owner's address, they should be entitled to turn on a cell phone to learn its number ... [W]hat happened in this case was similar but even less intrusive, since a cell phone's phone number can be found without searching the phone's contents, unless the phone is password-protected&#8212;and on some cell phones even if it is.</blockquote>The court declined to rule on the applicability of other warrant exceptions that exist for exigent circumstances, such as officer safety and preservation of evidence. The defendant in the case was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

<p>Courts have had difficulty in applying Fourth Amendment protections to modern technology. In January the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled that the government's attachment of a <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gps">global positioning system</a> (GPS) [JURIST news archive] device to a vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-rules-gps-tracking-of-vehicle-constitutes-search.php">constitutes a search</a> [JURIST report] under the Fourth Amendment. Last year the <a href="http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/courts/supreme/">Supreme Court of California</a> [official website] ruled that incident to a custodial arrest law enforcement officers <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/california-high-court-rules-no-warrant-needed-to-search-cell-phone-text-messages.php">may legally search text messages</a> [JURIST report] on a suspect's cell phone without a warrant. The court held a search of the defendant's cell phone text messages in the police station 90 minutes after the arrest did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The California decision represents a split from the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/default.htm">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/third-circuit-rules-warrant-may-be-required-to-collect-cell-phone-location-data.php">2010 ruling</a> and a <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2009/12/ohio-supreme-court-rules-warrantless.php">2009 decision</a> [JURST reports] by the <a href="http://www.sconet.state.oh.us/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website] that both held that police must obtain a warrant before searching data stored on a cell phone. In June 2010, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-allows-reasonable-searches-of-private-texts-on-work-issued-devices.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] unanimously that an employer's search of private text messages on a work-issued device does not violate the Fourth Amendment if the search is motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and is not excessive in scope.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Samsung alleged that Apple violated its patents for 3G technology while Apple argued that Samsung violated its patents on slide-to-unlock technology. Samsung officials stated that they were pleased with the ruling and that their Galaxy line of products is distinct and does not copy Apple's iPad and iPhone products. Including the two suits on Friday, <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/03/02/german_court_tosses_samsungs_3g_patent_suit_apples_slide_to_unlock_complaint.html">14 cases have now been decided</a> [Apple Insider report] between Apple and Samsung in Germany.

<p>Apple is involved in litigation all over the world over smartphone technology. Earlier this week Apple won a suit against <a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Home">Motorola Mobility</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MMI:US">backgrounder</a>] in Germany <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-27/apple-wins-temporary-ruling-on-german-ipad-iphone-sales-1-.html">preventing Motorola from enforcing a verdict</a> [Bloomberg report] while Apple appeals that Apple must remove certain iPad and iPhone models from German online stores. Last month Apple requested that the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/apple-inc-asks-federal-court-to-grant-injunction.php">grant a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against Samsung to block the company from selling its new phone, the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SCH-I515MSAVZW?cid=ppc_MOB_goo_A_-_Galaxy_Nexus_Galaxy_Nexus_galaxy_nexus">Galaxy Nexus</a> [official profile]. Apple requested an injunction, but was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-denies-injuction-request-by-apple-in-samsung-patent-case.php">denied</a> [JURIST report], against Samsung in the same court alleging that Samsung's "Galaxy" line of products copies Apple's iPhone and iPad technology. Earlier that month Apple brought suit in the <a href="http://www.casd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of California</a> [official website] seeking an injunction to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/apple-sues-motorola-in-federal-court-over-patent-claims-in-germany.php">stop Motorola from bringing patent claims against Apple in Germany</a> [JURIST report].

He is charged with 41 counts of crimes committed in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=darfur">Darfur</a> [JURIST news archive], including 20 counts of crimes against humanity (including persecution, murder, forcible transfer, rape, inhumane acts, imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty and torture) and 21 counts of war crimes (including murder, attacks against civilian population, destruction of property, rape, pillaging and outrage upon personal dignity). The arrest warrant found that the main victims of these crimes were the Fur populations. At the time of the alleged crimes, Hussein was the Minister of the Interior and the President's Special Representative in Darfur. The Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the allegations:<blockquote>[T]here are reasonable grounds to believe that, in his role as Minister of the Interior and Special Representative of the President in Darfur and as an influential member of the Government of the Republic of the Sudan, Mr Hussein made essential contributions to the formulation and implementation of the common plan, <em>inter alia</em>, through the recruitment, arming and funding of the police forces and the Militia/Janjaweed in Darfur.</blockquote>Considering such evidence, the court determined that an arrest is necessary "to ensure his appearance at trial and to ensure that he will not obstruct or endanger the investigations." 

<p>The ICC has now issued the fourth arrest warrant against high officials alleged to be involved in crimes committed in Darfur. Chief Prosecutor for the ICC Luis Moreno-Ocampo <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrant-for-sudan-defense-minister.php">submitted an application</a> [JURIST report] for the arrest warrant in December. The ICC has already issued warrants for <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc279813.PDF">Ahmad Muhammad Harun</a> [arrest warrant, PDF], former Sudanese interior minister and current humanitarian affairs minister, <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/rdonlyres/29B42DAB-BF84-476F-9C8B-5515B3B731D6/279931/CISAlBashirEn.pdf">President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir</a> [case materials, PDF], and <a href="http://www2.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc279858.PDF">Ali Kushayb</a> [arrest warrant, PDF], former senior Janjaweed commander. However, Sudan <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/icc-reports-sudan-to-un-for-lack-of-cooperation-with-arrest-warrants.php">remains uncooperative</a> [JURIST report] in pursuing alleged war criminals. ICC released a decision that asked the UN Security Council to take measures in compelling Sudan to comply its obligations under <a href="http://www.unsudanig.org/unsudan/data/res1593.pdf">Resolution 1593</a> [text, PDF]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/aclu-asks-appeals-court-block-anti-immigrant-laws-georgia-and-alabama">press release</a>] and a coalition of other civil and immigrant rights organizations claim that the <a href="http://alisondb.legislature.state.al.us/acas/searchableinstruments/2011RS/Printfiles//HB56-eng.pdf">Alabama</a> [HB 56, PDF] and <a href="http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb87.htm">Georgia</a> [HB 87 text] laws "endanger public safety and invite racial profiling" and "interfere with federal law that controls immigration law enforcement." After nearly five hours of oral arguments the court opted to refrain from acting until the Supreme Court provides some direction when it rules on the Arizona immigration legislation, which largely inspired the <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/alabama-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Alabama</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/georgia-governor-signs-anti-illegal-immigration-bill.php">Georgia</a> [JURIST reports] laws in question. Until the court issues a decision, the lower court rulings in the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/crisis-alabama-immigration-law-causes-chaos">Alabama</a> and <a href="http://www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/georgia-latino-alliance-human-rights-et-al-v-deal">Georgia</a> [ACLU backgrounders] cases will remain in effect. Oral argument before the Supreme Court for <span class="casename">Arizona v. United States</span> is scheduled for April 25, with a ruling expected by the end of the summer term.

<p>The Arizona immigration <a href= "http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">law</a> [SB 1070, PDF] has had a polarizing effect since its passage. Similar legislation has passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-legislature-approves-new-version-of-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports]. Attorneys for Arizona <a href="http://azgovernor.gov/">Governor Jan Brewer</a> filed a brief with the US Supreme Court in February, asking the court to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/arizona-files-opening-brief-with-supreme-court-on-immigration-law.php">lift the injunction</a> [JURIST report] that has blocked several provisions of SB 1070 from taking effect. In December the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether Arizona's controversial immigration law is <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">preempted by federal law</a> [JURIST report]. In November the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-urges-supreme-court-not-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-appeal.php">urged the Supreme Court not to hear Arizona's appeal</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court in May ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that Arizona's controversial employment-related immigration law is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">not preempted by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rios Montt is being charged for crimes committed throughout the country's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1215811.stm">36-year civil war</a> [BBC timeline], which officially ended in 1996. The case involves at least <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/guatemala.htm">1,771 deaths and 1,400 human rights violations</a> [Global Security backgrounder]. The ruling means the <a href="http://www.prensalibre.com.gt/noticias/justicia/MP-cierre-amnistia-Rios-Mott_0_655734584.html">trial against Rios Montt will continue</a> [<em>Prensa Libre</em> report, in Spanish] in an attempt to bring justice to the families of the victims. Revoking Rios Montt's amnesty is another step towards meeting conditions set by the US in order to receive military aid.

<p>Rios Montt's trial was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/guatemala-court-orders-ex-dictator-to-stand-trial.php">ordered to continue in January</a> [JURIST report]. The Guatemalan civil war resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala's large indigenous Mayan population. According to a <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/spanish/toc.html">UN report</a> [text, in Spanish] released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. In response to these violations, the Guatemalan government founded the National Compensation Program (PNR) in 2003 to deal with claims by civilians affected by the civil war. The PNR, after setting up its administrative structure, has begun to use its $40 million budget to work through a backlog of more than 98,000 civilian complaints. <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/guatemala-court-sentences-ex-soldiers-to-6000-years.php">Four former soldiers</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/former-guatemala-police-sentenced-to-40-years-with-evidence-from-rediscovered-archive.php">two former police officers</a> [JURIST reports] have already been convicted in relation to these crime.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://legis.virginia.gov/1_home/gen_info_senate.html">Virginia Senate</a> [official website], and is a scaled-back version of a similar <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?121+sum+SB484">bill</a> [text] that was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion">voted on</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. The current version of the bill removes the requirement for a transvaginal ultrasound to be performed, but continues to require a traditional transabdominal ultrasound. The bill retains the requirement that the women be provided with information regarding the gestational age and physical development of the fetus. In addition to altering the ultrasound requirements, the updated legislation redacts the portion of the previous version that would have required the medical professional to give the woman the option of listening to the fetal heart tone. The contentious bill was <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?121+vot+HV1293+HB0462">approved</a> [results] by a margin of 65 to 31.

<p>Virignia is not the first state to pass such legislation, and similar rules have drawn various results when challenged in the court system. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-sonogram-law.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">Texas law</a> [JURIST report] that requires women to have a sonogram before undergoing an abortion, allowing the law to be enforced. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010 the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill, which passed 92-24, would effectively ban the use of Sharia, as well as any other religious law, when dealing with issues such as divorce. This has led some to raise concerns of the validity of such ceremonies performed based on religious traditions. The bill will now pass to the senate for a full vote. The bill reads:<blockquote>Any court, arbitration, tribunal, or administrative agency ruling or decision violates the public policy of this state and is void and unenforceable if the court, arbitration, tribunal, or administrative agency bases its ruling or decision in the matter at issue in whole or in part on any foreign law, legal code, or system that does not grant the parties affected by the ruling or decision the same fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges guaranteed by the State Constitution or the United States Constitution.</blockquote>
If the bill passes, Florida will join Tennessee, Louisiana and Oklahoma as states with legislation limiting religious influence in legal decision making.

<p>Oklahoma's bill, which specifically mentions outlawing Sharia, is currently being <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/tenth-circuit-upholds-ruling-blocking-oklahoma-islamic-law-ban.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] until its constitutionality can be reviewed. That bill was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/oklahoma-voters-ban-use-of-islamic-international-law-in-state-court-decisions.php">passed by voters</a> [JURIST report] in November 2010. There has been a <a href="/forum/2011/11/umar-oseni-libya-sharia.php">wave of legislation attempting</a> [JURIST commentary] to outlaw Sharia and other foreign law which has sparked much <a href="/hotline/2010/11/oklahoma-ban-of-sharia-deems-Islam-as-un-american.php">controversy</a> [JURIST comment] around the issue. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The central tenet of the treaty is a balanced budget requirement. Of the 27 EU member states, only the UK and the Czech Republic did not sign the measure. The treaty comes as a new method to bring stability and coordination between the countries impacted by the European debt crisis. The EU said:<blockquote>The main elements of the so-called fiscal compact include a requirement for national budgets to be in balance or in surplus, a criterion that would be met if the annual structural government deficit does not exceed 0.5% of GDP at market prices. This balanced budget rule must be incorporated into the member states' national legal systems, preferably at constitutional level, within one year after the entry into force of the treaty. In the event of deviation from this rule, an automatic correction mechanism will be triggered. It will be defined by each member state on the basis of principles proposed by the European Commission.</blockquote>The treaty will become legally binding to all Eurozone countries after it is ratified by 12 member states. Although named a treaty, the UK's decision to withhold signature means that the measure is considered an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16057252">inter-governmental agreement</a> [BBC backgrounder] that is not integrated directly into EU treaties.

<p>EU governments have grappled with the proper methods to coordinate their responses to the region's fiscal instability. Some have commented that certain countries may need to <a href="/forum/2011/09/larry-eaker-eurozone-exit.php">leave the Eurozone</a> [JURIST op-ed] in order to achieve greater stability. Last week, Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/germany-high-court-rules-europe-stimulus-procedure-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that use of a parliamentary subcommittee to fast-track decisions related to eurozone bailouts is unconstitutional. In September, the German constitutional court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/germany-high-court-rejects-challenges-to-european-stimulus.php">rejected as unfounded</a> [JURIST report] three constitutional complaints against German and European legal instruments and other measures in connection with both the European Monetary Union rescue package and the financial aid package for Greece. The high court <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg11-055en.html">ruled</a> [press release] that by voting through national acts that implement the broader European measures, the Bundestag did not unconstitutionally impair its own ability to adopt and control the nation's budget, nor did it infringe on the budget autonomy of future parliaments. In May 2010, the court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/german-high-court-rejects-temporary-injunction-for-greece-bailout-funds.php">refused to issue a temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report]  against the German government's &#8364;22.4 billion ($28.5 billion) contribution to the bailout package for Greece, which has been gripped by a dire <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8508136.stm">debt crisis</a> [BBC backgrounder] and faced severe <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/greece-parliament-approves-austerity-measures.php">austerity measures</a> [JURIST report] as it confronted its debt concerns. The court held that the complainants seeking the injunction did not produce any concrete evidence that their rights under Germany's Basic Law could be "seriously and irreversibly" affected as a result of the guaranteed loan. The court's press release also noted that potential liability risk as a result of the contribution is outweighed by reducing the risks of damaging Germany's national economy as a result of instability of the European Monetary Union.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay's statements came at the Human Rights Council's annual discussion on rights of people with disabilities. Pillay noted that, although the <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=150">2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities</a> [text] has been ratified by 109 states and its Optional Protocol has been ratified by 66 states, mere ratification is not enough. She mentioned that a study by the High Commissioner's Office showed that "in many countries persons with disabilities continued to encounter a number of legal, physical and communication barriers." She said the Council should be able to find the major problems and suggest possible solutions in countries struggling with the issue.

<p>The UN General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-general-assembly-approves-landmark.php">adopted the convention</a> [JURIST report] in December 2006 as the first human rights treaty of the twenty-first century. It was <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/un-panel-approves-disability-rights.php">approved</a> in August of that year after running into some <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/un-disability-rights-treaty-talks.php">last-minute problems</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier that week, the committee that drafted the bill was given 150 proposed amendments to review. The US also caused frustration when the Bush administration said that it <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/un-panel-approves-disability-rights.php">would not sign</a> [JURIST report] the convention, claiming its <a href="http://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> [home page] already provided adequate protection for its citizens with disabilities. President Barack Obama's administration, however, voiced support and <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/us-signs-un-disability-rights-treaty.php">signed the treaty</a> [JURIST report] in 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While USACE argued that it should be entitled to immunity from such lawsuits under the <a href="http://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/mrc/history/AppendixE.htm">Flood Control Act of 1928</a> [text], the court disagreed, finding that the Corps had not properly maintained the <a href="http://www.mrgo.gov/">Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet</a> (MRGO) [USACE backgrounder], a New Orleans navigation channel that suffered tremendous flood damages. In upholding a 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/federal-judge-finds-army-corps-of.php">decision</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website], the Fifth Circuit found that USACE had made "negligent decisions" that "rested on applications of objective scientific principles and were not susceptible to policy consideration." Reasoned the court:<blockquote>At points where it  could have mattered, the Corps did not identify MRGO's ability to aggravate the effect of a major hurricane. This is not a situation in which the Corps recognized a risk and chose not to mitigate it out of concern for some other public policy (e.g., navigation or commerce); it flatly failed to gauge the risk.</blockquote>In upholding the district court's ruling, the Fifth Circuit allowed five plaintiffs to recover approximately $720,000. 

<p>Since Katrina, USACE has received about 500,000 other similar administrative claims, and attempted to dismiss this case on several occasions. In March 2009, federal judge Stanwood R. Duval Jr. <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-denies-army-corps-of.php">found</a> [JURIST report] that material questions of fact existed as to a potential violation of USACE's mandate that, if proven, would preclude it from protection under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-VI/chapter-171">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> [text]. In May 2009, Duval <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/federal-judge-rejects-latest-katrina.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the MRGO is a shipping channel rather than a flood control outlet, which would have given USACE immunity in tort actions. In a similar instance in February 2007, Duval denied USACE's motion to dismiss, which argued that the MRGO was part of a larger flood control system in New Orleans rather than strictly a shipping channel. Three months before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, an expert at the <a href="http://hurricane.lsu.edu/">LSU Hurricane Center</a> [official website] predicted that the MRGO could amplify storm surges by 20-40 percent. After Katrina, the center determined through computer modeling that the presence of the MRGO also increased the speed of the surge, causing an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301200_pf.html">even greater detrimental effect</a> [WP report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suspects, including 16 Americans and 27 other foreigners and Egyptians, were <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-ngo-employees-to-face-trial.php">charged with promoting democracy in Egypt</a> [JURIST report] without proper documentation and through the use of illegal funds. All but one of the 16 Americans charged in the alleged crimes left the country on Thursday. State Department spokeswoman <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/bios/180394.htm">Victoria Nuland</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/03/us-egypt-usa-ngos-idUSTRE82206H20120303">said</a> [Reuters report] that it would be up to the US citizens who left to decide whether to return to Egypt to face the charges, but also that she ultimately hopes the case will be dismissed.

<p>The three judges originally responsible for adjudicating the workers' criminal prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-judges-withdraw-from-ngo-case.php">withdrew from the case</a> [JURIST report] last week. Though unclear as to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/egyptian-judges-withdraw-from-trial-of-16-american-pro-democracy-workers-cite-uneasiness/2012/02/28/gIQA5QebgR_story.html">what caused their withdrawal</a> [AP report], Egyptian lawyer and rights activist Ahmen Seif-al-Islam suggested that political pressure could be the source, noting that the case has strained Egypt's relationship with the US. Specifically, in February, US Ambassador to the UN <a href="http://usun.state.gov/leadership/c31461.htm">Susan Rice</a> [official profile] urged Egypt to release the suspects, and US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/c27775.htm">Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> [official profile] threatened to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/05/us-egypt-ngo-usa-idUSTRE8140PX20120205">reconsider the $1.3 billion in annual aid given to Egypt</a> [Reuters report]. In January, the Egyptian government <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/egypt-government-denies-crackdown-on-ngos.php">denied cracking down</a> [JURIST report] on NGOs amid criticism from various human rights groups. Earlier, in December, the Egyptian government agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/us-state-department-egypt-to-halt-raids-on-pro-democracy-groups.php">cease its raids of NGOs</a> [JURIST report] after the US expressed concern about Egypt's approach toward NGO activity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposed settlement comprises two separate agreements between BP and plaintiffs, one to resolve economic loss claims and another to resolve medical claims, and each is expected to be paid out of the $20 billion compensation trust established by BP in the wake of the disaster. However, the settlement includes neither claims against BP made by the US Department of Justice and other federal agencies, nor by states and local governments. The deal also excludes certain other claims against BP, such as various pending securities and shareholder claims, and claims based solely on the deepwater drilling moratorium or the related permitting process. Additionally the proposed settlement provides that class members would release and dismiss their claims against BP, and that BP will assign to the plaintiffs certain of its claims, rights and recoveries against Transocean and Halliburton for damages not recoverable from BP. The proposal will next be submitted to Judge Carl Barbier of the <a href="http://www.laed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana</a> [official website] for final approval. The settlement does not constitute an admission of liability by BP.

<p>Earlier this week Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/bp-oil-spill-trial-postponed-to-allow-more-time-for-settlement.php">postponed the multi-billion dollar trial</a> [JURIST report] over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, hours before the trial was set to begin, in order to give BP more time to reach an agreement with plaintiffs. Last month Barbier issued an order that <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/bp-ordered-to-share-partial-liability-with-transocean-in-oil-spill-claims.php">BP will be held liable for a portion of the damages owed by Transocean</a> [JURIST report] as a result of the disaster. Transocean is the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that was contracted by BP and subsequently caused the oil spill. BP will be required to indemnify Transocean against damages created by the pollution itself that are awarded throughout the litigation pending against it. BP will not be required to pay an punitive damages or civil fines as a result of these suits. The court did not rule as to whether BP or Transocean would be held strictly liable, negligent or grossly negligent for the equipment failure and subsequent oil spill that created the pollution. The ruling is separate from an August ruling by Barbier <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-judge-rules-punitive-damages-available-against-BP-in-claims-over-oil-spill.php">permitting punitive damages against BP</a> [JURIST report], but that ruling pertained to claims brought against BP directly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Established in February 2011 by an emergency session of the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website], the Commission was mandated to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in Libya, and to establish the facts and circumstances of such violations and of the crimes perpetrated. With respect to the national Libyan forces of former leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12537524">Muammar Gaddafi</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gaddafi">news archive</a>], the Commission "concluded that international crimes, specifically crimes against humanity and war crimes, were committed ... Acts of murder, enforced disappearance, and torture were perpetrated within the context of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population." Regarding the opposing side of the conflict, the Commission reported that the anti-Gaddafi <em>thuwar</em> rebels "committed serious violations, including war crimes and breaches of international human rights law, the latter continuing at the time of the present report. The Commission found these violations to include unlawful killing, arbitrary arrest, torture, enforced disappearance, indiscriminate attacks, and pillage." The Commission further concluded that NATO "conducted a highly precise campaign with a demonstrable determination to avoid civilian casualties" but that further investigations are recommended to evaluate its effectiveness. The report concludes that the Libyan interim government must equally investigate all abuses regardless of the perpetrator, and that Libya will need continued support from the UN and the international community at large to overcome "a legacy of more than 40 years of serious human rights violations and deterioration of the legislative framework, judicial and national institutions."

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations during the Libya conflict have been widespread. Last month <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a report accusing the ruling <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=NTC">news archive</a>] in Libya of allowing the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/libya-leaders-abusing-torturing-gaddafi-supporters-ai.php">abuse and torture of Gaddafi supporters</a> [JURIST report] by unofficial militias. In October AI alleged that Libyan forces arrested nearly 2,500 people who face <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-officials-urged-to-stop-prisoner-abuse.php">ongoing torture and detainment</a> [JURIST report] without formal charges. In September the NTC vowed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses after AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the Libya conflict are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate these allegations. That same month the NTC assured world leaders that Libya will be a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/libya-interim-leaders-pledge-adherence-to-rule-of-law.php">society of tolerance and respect</a> [JURIST report] for the rule of law. During a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14758905">meeting</a> [BBC report] in Paris chaired by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, NTC leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14613679">Mustafa Abdel Jalil</a> [BBC profiles] vowed to administer elections and draft a new constitution for Libya within 18 months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The newly elected parliament will choose the members of the 100-member council that will ultimately determine the structure of the government and the rights conferred by the constitution. This has caused an intense debate between the parties of parliament who have differing opinions on who should be included in the assembly. The ruling Freedom and Justice Party argues there should be 40 members of parliament and 60 legal experts on the panel. Other parties argue there should be greater representation of minority groups.

<p>The debate comes after the voting system in the parliamentary elections was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-court-rules-parliamentary-election-process-unconstitutional.php">declared unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The make-up of the constitutional panel will be important to the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/hrw-calls-on-new-egypt-parliament-to-expand-rights.php">expansion of rights called for</a> [JURIST report] by Human Rights Watch in January.

Noting a recent uptick in sectarian related attacks, the group of experts warned that "sectarian violence threatens to worsen if the Government does not respond swiftly and decisively to confront it." Speaking before the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website], <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Minorities/IExpert/Pages/RitaIzsak.aspx">Rita Izsak</a> [official profile], an independent expert on minority issues claimed:<blockquote>[These attacks] have sadly become a recurrent practice in Pakistan, and we urge the Pakistan Government to identify and prosecute the perpetrators and do everything possible to establish strengthened security measures.</blockquote> <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Religion/CV_bielefeldt.pdf">Heiner Bielefeldt</a> [official profile, PDF], professor of human rights at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, said "these targeted killings once more display the appalling degree of religious hatred in a country where there seems to be a failure to protect the security of religious minorities."

<p>Pakistan has seen a rash of <a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/03-Mar-2012/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-end-sectarian-violence-protect-minorities">bloody attacks</a> [<em>The Nation</em> report] in recent weeks that were sectarian in nature.

The women received permission from the <a href="http://www.health.gov.il/English/Pages/HomePage.aspx">Health Ministry</a> [official website] in 2006 to conceive the child by fertilizing one woman's egg with the sperm of an anonymous donor and implanting the embryo in the other woman's uterus. When the child was born in 2007, the <a href="http://www.moin.gov.il/Pages/default.aspx">Interior Ministry</a> [official website, in Hebrew] would only recognize the woman who had given birth as the child's legal mother and advised the other woman to initiate adoption proceedings. The women instead opted to challenge that decision in court. Judge Alyssa Miller <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israeli-court-recognizes-lesbian-couple-as-biological-mothers-of-child-1.416637">granted</a> [Haaretz report] the couple's motion Sunday, finding that it would defy logic and common sense to deny parental rights to both women. The couple's lawyer <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4198660,00.html">welcomed the ruling</a> [Ynet News report], noting that there are several similar cases currently pending before Israeli courts. However, the precedential effect of the ruling may be limited, as the Health Ministry banned the transfer of eggs last year.

<p>Courts throughout the US and across the globe have struggled to define parental rights for same-sex couples. Last month a Massachusetts court ruled that same-sex couples who marry and have a baby via artificial insemination are <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/massachusetts-court-rules-child-custody-laws-apply-to-same-sex-parents.php">bound by the same child custody laws</a> [JURIST report] as heterosexual couples. In January an Iowa court ordered  that the Department of Public Health must <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/iowa-court-orders-both-same-sex-parents-be-included-on-birth-certificate.php">include both names</a> [JURIST report] of married same-sex parents on children's birth certificates, causing one expert to opine that the arguments made in the public debate surrounding the case demonstrate a break from the goals of the early gay rights movement and could be <a href="/forum/2012/01/mary-ziegler-parental-rights.php">used to justify discrimination</a> [JURIST op-ed] against other forms of non-traditional families. In October the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/the-supreme-court-has-a-big-day.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/adar-v-smith.html">Adar v. Smith</a> [backgrounder], in which a same-sex couple asked Louisiana to include both of their names on the birth certificate of their adopted child. That same month, a Canadian court granted legal rights to a non-biological father of a child&#8212;the ex-partner of the biological father&#8212;over the biological father in a child custody case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to his prison sentence, Soltani is also <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/04/2674886/daughter-iran-dissident-gets-18.html">forbidden from practicing law for 20 years</a> [AP report]. Soltani was arrested last year and has been held in a jail in Tehran while awaiting his trial. According to his daughter, in addition to his spreading anti-government propaganda charge, he was also charged with accepting an illegal prize from Germany, endangering national security and being one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.humanrights-ir.org/english/">Center for Human Rights Defenders</a> [advocacy website], along with Nobel Peace Prize laureate <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2003/ebadi-autobio.html">Shirin Ebadi</a> [Nobel profile]. Soltani is expected to be transferred to a remote prison in Borazjan, about 620 miles from Tehran.

<p>Soltani has faced previous charges brought by the Iranian government. In 2007 an Iranian appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/iran-human-rights-lawyer-acquitted-by.php">acquitted Soltani of charges related to espionage</a> [JURIST report] after the court determined there was no evidence of illegal activity. The Iranian appeals court decision overturned the lower court's finding of guilt and prior sentence of five years imprisonment. During this prior trial, Soltani served a total of seven months in prison. Soltani was arrested in 2005 while he was representing the family of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/kazemi/">Iranian-Canadian photographer Zahra Kazemi</a> [CBC backgrounder], who died in Iranian custody in July 2003 <a href="/paperchase/2005/03/doctor-says-photojournalist-killed-in.php">amidst allegations of torture and abuse</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Clair</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that, when ruling on a defendant's motion to replace counsel in a capital case, "courts should employ the same 'interests of justice' standard that they apply in non-capital cases under a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3006A">related statute</a>." [18 USC &#167; 3006A]. Kenneth Clair was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a request for appointment of counsel, which was granted, but he later sought to replace his lawyer, which was denied. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Clair was <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Clair_v_Ayers_403_Fed_Appx_276_9th_Cir_2010_Court_Opinion">entitled to new counsel</a> [opinion]. Reversing the decision below, Justice Elena Kagan found that the "District Court here did not abuse its discretion in denying respondent Kenneth Clair's motion to change counsel."

<p>At <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-confrontation-clause-right-to-counsel.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report], the attorney for the state of California argued that, due to numerous safeguards and procedural rulings on the effectiveness of Clair's counsel, the state had done due diligence in protecting his rights and did not have an obligation to grant him new counsel after 12 years of proceedings. The attorney for Clair disagreed and argued that Clair did not have a right to new counsel, merely a right to a thorough investigation of his current counsel, which he was denied.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Khodorkovsky and his former business partner Platon Lebedev were <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/russia-court-finds-khodorkovsky-guilty-of-embezzlement.php">convicted</a> in December 2010 and <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/khodorkovsky-sentenced-to-six-more-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST reports] on charges connected with embezzling more than $27 billion from Yukos oil. Controversy has surrounded the charges and the accompanying prison sentence from opponents of <a href="http://www.premier.gov.ru/eng/">Prime Minister Vladimir Putin</a> [official profile] who suspect that Khodorkovsky's sentence is <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/03/05/russia-medvedev-khodorkovsky-idINDEE82405120120305">politically motivated</a> [Reuters report]. Medvedev's order comes after opposition leaders gave him a list of prisoners whose sentences are believed to be solely politically motivated. Opponents of the Medvedev/Putin administration are skeptical of Medvedev's order as an empty gesture and are waiting to see if the president and the prosecutor general comply with the order. Putin has recently won a six-year term as president and after he is inaugurated in May, he is expected to appoint Medvedev as prime minister.

<p>Opposition leaders are not the only group that has shown skepticism about the validity of Khodorkovsky's sentence. In December, the Russia Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights under President Dmitry Medvedev called for the prosecutor general to petition to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/russia-rights-council-condemns-khodorkovsky-conviction.php">annul the conviction</a> [JURIST report]. Describing the verdict as fictitious, council member and former Constitutional Court judge, Tamara Morshchakova, noted the council found neither evidence nor substance to the charges brought against Khodorkovsky in the second trial. The council's decisions are non-binding and have seldom elicited action from Russian authorities. In July, the council urged amnesty for economic crimes in a meeting with Medvedev that would include amnesty for the crimes of Khodorkovsky. Last year former Russian prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/russia-ex-pm-testifies-khodorkovsky-arrest-politically-motivated.php/">testified</a> [JURIST report] that former president and current prime minister Vladimir Putin ordered Khodorkovsky's arrest for political reasons, indicating that Khodorkovsky had funded the Communist Party without first getting approval to do so from the president.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Supreme Court objected to the ruling and <a href="http://isna.ir/isna/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1963317&Lang=E">annulled it</a> [ISNA report], sending it back to another branch for retrial. No other details were given by the spokesman for the judiciary. The decision comes after Hekmati, a former Marine, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/iran-court-sentences-alleged-cia-spy-to-death.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report] in early January on grounds of being a CIA spy and trying to link Iran with terrorism. The conviction was based largely on a confession offered by Hekmati that he then retracted, saying he was forced to make such a statement. The US has repeatedly demanded Hekmati's release, while his family contends that he was only in the country to visit his grandmother. 

<p><a href="/paperchase/2011/12/trial-begins-in-iran-for-alleged-cia-spy.php">Preliminary hearings</a> [JURIST report] for Hekmati began in late December. Leading evidence against Hekmati included the <a href="http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/24615-iran-begins-trial-of-accused-cia-spy">confession made on Iranian state television</a> [Naharnet report] where he admitted his mission was to infiltrate Iran's intelligence systems by initially offering information to gain their trust and in order to find evidence that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/27/world/meast/iran-accused-spy-trial/">Iran was involved in terrorist activity</a> [CNN report]. Hekmati told the court that he was fooled by the CIA and did not want to hurt Iran, according to a <a href="http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9007279080">Fars News report</a> [FNA report]. The US contends that the allegations against Hekmati are false and that his <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/12/27/iran-begins-trial-of-alleged-cia-spy-amir-mirzai-hekmati/">confessions were forced</a> [AFP report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The group of 42 shareholders have <a href="http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2012/03/145272.html">accused</a> [<em>Kyodo News</em> report] 27 current and former TEPCO directors of ignoring warning signs and failing to take appropriate measure to mitigate damages in the event of an earthquake and ensuing tsunami. The shareholders want the damages paid to TEPCO, which would then use the money to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/05/tepco-lawsuit-idUSL4E8E54M620120305">compensate victims</a> [Reuters report]. This is likely the civil lawsuit ever filed in Japan.

<p>The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 is considered one of the biggest man-made environmental disasters of all time and the largest nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Following the 9.0 magnitude Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, three Fukushima reactors experienced full meltdowns, while the other three malfunctioned in various other ways. Due to the tsunami, flood waters swept in and out of the building, becoming irradiated and affecting the surrounding area. Japan has been criticized for its handling of the crisis, and international reception to nuclear energy has fallen sharply since the incident. In a Forum op-ed, <a href="/forum/2011/04/fukushima-illustrates-need-for-policy.php">Fukushima Illustrates Need for Nuclear Policy</a> [JURIST op-ed], Tamar Cerafici of the Cerafici Law Firm discussed how the Fukushima disaster should guide US policy. In August Japanese lawmakers voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/japan-lawmakers-approve-fukushima-victim-compensation-plan.php">create a fund to compensate victims</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charges stem from the collapse of the country's three major banks in 2008 while Haarde was leader of the country's ruling Independence Party. The trial originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/trial-begins-for-iceland-ex-pm-over-role-in-banking-collapse.php">began in September</a> [JURIST report] with Haarde's lawyers moving to dismiss all of the charges against him, a request which was denied. Haarde <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/trial-begins-for-iceland-ex-pm-over-role-in-banking-collapse.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] in June, vowing to fight the charges and claiming they were the result of politics, a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17254544">sentiment he reaffirmed</a> [BBC report] on Monday. The trial got underway after the Iceland Parliament voted last week to <a href="http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2012/03/02/trial-of-former-iceland-pm-will-continue-following-parliamentary-challenge/">dismiss a request</a> [IceNews report] by the current leader of the Independence Party to end the trial. Public sentiment in the country is split as to the effect the trial will have. Some believe it is necessary to understand the problems that went into the conflict, while others see Haarde as a failed politician who is being sacrificed by the new government. 

<p>In September 2010, the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/">Icelandic Parliament</a> [official website, in Icelandic] referred charges to the Landsdomur, a special court to try cabinet ministers, after the <a href="http://sic.althingi.is/">Special Investigation Committee</a> (SIC) [official website] released a <a href="http://sic.althingi.is/pdf/RNAvefurKafli21Enska.pdf">"Truth Report"</a> [report, PDF] claiming that seven Icelandic government officials acted with gross negligence in their management of the country's financial system prior to a 2008 bank collapse. The SIC determined that Haarde and former central bank head <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/thingm/1701487469.html?knt=1701487469">David Oddsson</a> [official profile, in Icelandic] knew that banks were assuming overseas debt but took no action to prevent or mitigate the effects of the accumulation. The SIC also found that former minister of finance Arni Mathiessen, then-banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson, former <a href="http://www.fme.is/?PageID=146">Financial Services Authority</a> [official website] director Jonas Jonsson and central bank officials Eirikur Gundason and Ingimundur Fridriksson failed to take appropriate action when presented with information about the poor state of the country's financial sector. Iceland was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7658908.stm">hit hard</a> [BBC backgrounder] by the financial crisis that emanated from securities related to the US mortgage market. When <a href="http://www.kaupthing.com/pages/4189">Kaupthing</a>, <a href="http://www.landsbanki.is/english/">Landsbanki</a> and <a href="http://glitnirbank.com/">Glitnir</a> [corporate websites] were taken over by the Icelandic government in 2008, they were holding debt equal to more than <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jrvnmZfcNSF0flZgJlFOhmk3CX1w">900 percent</a> [AFP report] of Iceland's gross domestic product, causing the country's economy to collapse and the government to <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extrans1.aspx?memberKey1=420&endDate=2010-04-13&finposition_flag=YES">rely on loans</a> [IMF materials] from the <a href="http://www.imf.org/">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a> [official website] to meet its obligations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Royal Dutch Petroleum</a> [docket], a case dealing with corporate liability for human rights violations occurring overseas. The court originally <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">took the case</a> in October and <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-corporate-liability-for-torture-overseas.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] last week to determine whether three oil companies are immune from US lawsuits under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28/usc_sec_28_00001350----000-.html">Alien Tort Statute of 1789</a> (ATS) [text] for alleged torture and international law violations. In a brief order Monday, the court "directed [the parties] to file supplemental briefs addressing the following question: 'Whether and under what circumstances the Alien Tort Statute ... allows courts to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.'" The court set deadlines of May 3 for the petitioners' brief, June 4 for the respondents' brief and June 29 for the petitioners' reply brief, meaning that the case will not be reheard until next term.

<p>While accepting that international law is the proper authority to define human rights violations, the petitioners, Nigerian plaintiffs suing foreign-based oil companies, argued last week that domestic US common law should fill in the blank in ATS over who could actually be sued for such atrocities. The US government sided with the petitioners, with Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler providing the additional argument that international law does not independently foreclose foreign corporate liability the way that it immunizes a foreign government from liability for official wrongdoings. The respondent oil companies argued that international law is wholly controlling in such a situation and that domestic US common law has no bearing on the proceedings. Respondents pressed the fact that not only does international law not recognize corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses, but the world community has never recognized corporate liability for the misdeeds of individuals: "No other nation in the world permits its court to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection." While the issue in the case was supposed to focus on "the narrow issue of whether a corporation can ever be held liable for violating fundamental human rights norms under the Alien Tort Statute," the court frequently pushed petitioners on the specific point of whether Congress intended ATS to permit suits by aliens against aliens for overseas acts. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/A-HRC-19-55_en.pdf">report</a> [text] indicated that, "journalists and media workers active on human rights issues were subject to killings, attacks, disappearance, abduction, torture and ill-treatment." The report called on state and non-state actors to recognize the objective role played by these observers, and to offer them proper protection from unwarranted criminal prosecution. In a statement to the UN Human Rights Council, Sekaggya said:<blockquote>Journalists, environmental, student and youth rights defenders and those working on land issues are in significant need of protection. ... Most of these risks directly affect their physical integrity and that of their family members, but also involve the abusive use of legal frameworks against them and the criminalization of their work.</blockquote>The report also recognized the need to protect those active on human rights issues who are not formally recognized as journalists and media workers, but "should include other relevant actors, such as community media workers, bloggers and those monitoring demonstrations."

<p>Protection of human rights remains a central concern for the UN, with rights activists across the globe being subject to violence and arrest. In October, Sekaggya <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/human-rights-defenders-still-threatened-un-expert.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] indicating that human rights defenders were still being harassed, attacked and killed more than a decade after the international declaration adopted for their protection. In August Chinese authorities in Beijing <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/china-begins-trial-against-human-rights-activist.php">began the trial</a> [JURIST report] of Wang Lihong, one of the dozens of human rights activists the government detained earlier this year as part of a crackdown on dissidents in the country. Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>] remains imprisoned in China despite international calls for his release. In July a coalition of human rights organizations issued a joint statement <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-groups-urge-russia-probe-of-activist-estemirova-murder.php">urging the Russian government to investigate the murder</a> [JURIST report] of rights activist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8152648.stm">Natalia Estemirova</a> [BBC obituary; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Estemirova">news archive</a>]. Estemirova, who was kidnapped in Grozny in July 2009 and shot to death, reported regularly on human rights abuses committed by the Chechen government, including extrajudicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances. In June Zimbabwean human rights activist Farai Maguwu was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/zimbabwe-rights-activist-arrest-over-conflict-diamond-information.php">arrested</a> for allegedly supplying false information about Zimbabwe's controversial diamond mining practices to the international diamond control body the <a href="http://www.kimberleyprocess.com/">Kimberley Process</a> [advocacy website].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Stanford was convicted on 13 of 14 charges, including conspiracy to commit wire or mail fraud, conspiracy to obstruct a <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] investigation, obstruction of an SEC investigation and conspiracy to commit money laundering in addition to five counts of wire fraud and five counts of mail fraud. He was acquitted on one charge of wire fraud. Stanford faces more than 20 years in prison if the judge orders that sentences be served consecutively.

<p>Stanford's trial began in January after a judge ruled in December that he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-rules-financier-stanford-competent-to-stand-trial.php">mentally competent</a> [JURIST report] to stand trial. His lawyers were unsuccessful in arguing that he suffered from retrograde amnesia and diminished mental capacity as a result of head injuries sustained during a 2009 assault while in prison. Last year Stanford filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/financier-stanford-sues-federal-agents-over-civil-rights-violations.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] accusing federal agents of violating his constitutional rights. The suit named 12 defendants, including members of the FBI, the SEC and the Department of Justice. Stanford alleged that the defendants used "abusive law-enforcement methods" to <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">pursue a frivolous civil suit</a> [JURIST report] against him in order to gather evidence for his criminal prosecution. In June 2009 Stanford <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-pleads-not-guilty-in.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 21 charges of fraud, conspiracy and obstruction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Benson Everett Legg ruled that the law limited individuals' rights to obtaining a permit by requiring a "good and substantial reason," and that requirement was not reasonably adapted to a substantial government interest of public safety or crime prevention. Legg wrote, "A citizen may not be required to offer a good and substantial reason why he should be permitted to exercise his rights. The right's existence is all the reason he needs." The constitutionality of other portions of the permit law were not addressed by the court. The plaintiff's attorney in the case recognized that most states have licensing systems and all that is sought by the plaintiff is one that is <a href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2012/03/05/md-gun-law-found-unconstitutional/">straightforward and objective</a> [AP report]. The removal of the ambiguous language "good and substantial reason" should accomplish this goal. The defendant, the <a href="http://www.oag.state.md.us/">Maryland Attorney General's Office</a> [official website], is still reviewing the opinion. 

<p>In July 2010 Chicago citizens <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/citizens-file-suit-against-chicago-gun-control-ordinance.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the city's gun control ordinance claiming it was unconstitutional. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/chicago-approves-new-handgun-regulations.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] just four days after the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1521">McDonald v. Chicago</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-rules-second-amendment-applies-to-states.php">report</a>] that the Second Amendment applies to states and municipalities as well as the federal government. The court's ruling in <span class="casename">McDonald</span> cited the holding in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZS.html">District of Columbia v. Heller</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-dc-gun-ban.php">report</a>] where the court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense. The District of Columbia enacted a new series of firearm regulations following the court's ruling in <span class="casename">Heller</span>. The regulations were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-upholds-gun-limits-in-dc.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by a federal judge who cited <span class="casename">Heller</span>, holding that the Second Amendment does not prohibit regulation of firearms where that regulation will "effectuate the goal of promoting public safety." </p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was approved with a <a href="http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/vote.aspx?VoteID=8836">34-19 vote</a> [roll call vote]. According to the bill's sponsor, Senator Larry Loudermilk (R), it is <a href="http://www.independentmail.com/news/2012/mar/05/ga-senate-passes-immigration-colleges-bill/">not about education</a> [AP report], but on preventing taxpayer dollars from benefiting those persons in the country illegally. Illegal immigrants' access to private institutions is not affected, and attendance in some state colleges and universities is still permitted by paying out of state tuition rates. South Carolina is currently the only state that prohibits state colleges and universities from admitting illegal immigrants. The bill also aims to clarify requirements for individuals seeking public benefits, such as food stamps and professional licenses. The bill now heads to the House for passage. A Georgia House committee had previously discussed a bill banning illegal immigrant's access to higher education, but members did not vote on that bill. 

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/index.php">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] heard arguments in a challenge to illegal immigration legislation recently passed in Alabama and Georgia, but chose to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eleventh-circuit-defers-ruling-on-alabama-georgia-immigration-laws.php">defer its ruling</a> [JURIST report] until after the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] rules on a pending challenge to the controversial <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">Arizona immigration law</a> [JURIST news archive]. The Arizona immigration <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">law</a> [SB 1070, PDF] has had a polarizing effect since its passage. Similar legislation has passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-legislature-approves-new-version-of-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports]. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in December to determine whether Arizona's controversial immigration law is <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eleventh-circuit-defers-ruling-on-alabama-georgia-immigration-laws.php">preempted by federal law</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder's comments also addressed the success of the federal courts and revised military commissions in prosecuting terrorism offenders, as well as the factors used to consider the choice of forum for individual defendants. Holder stressed that it was important to use both venues to bring justice in terrorism cases. His comments then turned to those situations requiring extra-judicial means of threat mitigation, noting that the Congressional authority to respond to threats posed by al Qaeda, the Taliban and associated forces with "appropriate and lethal force" is not limited in geographic scope and extends beyond the battlefield in Afghanistan, and can include the specific targeting of leaders.  Holder then pointed to historic and current Supreme Court cases that show that US citizenship alone "does not make individuals immune from being targeted." Holder said:<blockquote>The Supreme Court has made clear that the Due Process Clause does not impose one-size-fits-all requirements, but instead mandates procedural safeguards that depend on specific circumstances. In cases arising under the Due Process Clause&#8212;including in a case involving a US citizen captured in the conflict against al Qaeda&#8212;the Court has applied a balancing approach, weighing the private interest that will be affected against the interest the government is trying to protect, and the burdens the government would face in providing additional process. Where national security operations are at stake, due process takes into account the realities of combat.</blockquote>The attorney general indicated that lethal force would only be used in a foreign country when: there is an imminent threat of violent attack on the US, capture of the individual is not feasible and any actions would be consistent with the laws of war. Holder argued that while the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/">US Constitution</a> [text] grants the right of due process, it does not grant the right to judicial process; saying, "'Due process' and 'judicial process' are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security." As result, Holder argued that the president is not required to seek court approval before taking action against a US citizen accused of being a senior operational leader of al Qaeda. Holder indicated that robust oversight of the operations and their legal frameworks is provided be appropriate members of Congress. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] issued a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-comment-eric-holder-speech-targeted-killing-program">statement</a> [press release] criticizing Holder's remarks. Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU's National Security Project said, "Few things are as dangerous to American liberty as the proposition that the government should be able to kill citizens anywhere in the world on the basis of legal standards and evidence that are never submitted to a court, either before or after the fact." The ACLU also <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/targeted-killing-speech-holder-mischaracterizes-debate-over-judicial-review">argued</a> [statement] that while the attorney general claimed that these citizens have a right to due process, his speech also claimed that only the Executive Branch "should determine whether the due process requirement is satisfied." There has been substantial debate in the legal community regarding whether the targeted killings of US citizens engaged against the United States with al Qaeda and associated groups is <a href="/forum/2011/10/jeffrey-addicott-al-Awlaki.php">legal</a> or a <a href="/forum/2011/10/morris-davis-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">violation</a> [JURIST op-eds] of the laws of war.

<p>This speech marks another step in the <a href="http://jurist.org/currentawareness/terrorism.php">legal response</a> [JURIST news archive] to the war on terrorism in the <a href="/feature/featured/911/">wake of 9/11</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Although not explicitly named, the speech is partially a response to killing of US citizen and senior al Qaeda leader <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11658920">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Awlaki">news archive</a>] by US forces. An Obama administration legal memorandum from last year found that the killing of al-Awlaki would only be legal if it were not feasible to take him alive. Al Awlaki was <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/us-forces-kill-senior-al-qaeda-leader-anwar-al-Awlaki.php">killed by a CIA drone strike</a> [JURIST report] in Yemen in September. The strike marked the US government's most successful attack against al Qaeda since the raid leading to the <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/us-forces-kill-osama-bin-laden-in-firefight.php">death of Osama bin Laden</a> [JURIST report] in Pakistan last May. The US-born radical Muslim cleric reportedly used his English and Internet skills to recruit individuals for attacks in the US. The ACLU criticized the targeted killing as a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-statement-killing-anwar-al-aulaqi">violation of both US and international law</a> [press release]. The US has increased drone strikes in Yemen to try and reduce al Qaeda's power in the region and minimize the chaos spilling over the border into Saudi Arabia. The US targeted Awlaki in a strike last May but was unsuccessful. In August 2010, prior to al Awlaki's death, the ACLU and the <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/rights-groups-file-suit-over-us-assassination-order-suspected-terrorist.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the US government's authority to conduct "targeted killings" against suspect terrorists. In addition to requesting the criteria used to place al Awlaki on a so-called "kill list," the suit also asked the court to set standards describing when the government could constitutionally use lethal force against a U.S. citizen away from an active battlefield. The Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/obama-invokes-state-secrets-in-effort-to-block-targeted-killings-lawsuit.php">invoked state secrets</a> [JURIST report] while seeking to block the lawsuit. The suit was <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds that it raised "political questions."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The injunction was issued by Circuit Court Judge David Flanagan who said that the Wisconsin law was more restrictive than similar laws that have been upheld in other states. The new law requires all voters to present a form of photo identification at the polls. The suit was filed in December by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who argue that voter fraud is not widespread and that Wisconsin's law may disenfranchise minority voters. An appeal of the decision is expected. Additionally, Ben Sparks, the Communications Director for the <a href="http://www.wisgop.org/">Republican Party of Wisconsin</a> [official website], has <a href="http://www.wisgop.org/news/rpw-ask-investigation-judge-flanagan">called for an investigation</a> [press release] into Judge Flanagan's involvement in the case, alleging that Flanagan is biased because he signed a petition to recall <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/Home">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website].

<p>This is one of four challenges to Wisconsin's voter ID law. In December, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.aclu-wi.org/">ACLU of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.nlchp.org/">National Law Center on Homelessness &#38; Poverty</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Wisconsin law. Lawsuits have also been filed by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-groups-bring-new-challenge-against-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">Advancement Project</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/womens-group-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">League of Women Voters</a> [JURIST reports]. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=16602">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In August South Carolina's Senate Minority Caucus <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-democrats-protest-against-voter-id-law.php">filed an objection</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], asking it to reject the state's new voter identification law. In June Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo identification at voting booth. Last March the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld </a>[JURIST report] a law requiring voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote.

Samsung alleges that Apple's iPhone 4S and iPad 2 infringe patents it owns involving methods of displaying data, the user interface and text messaging. This latest filing brings the litigation between Samsung and Apple to a total of 30 cases in 10 different countries. The litigation battle between the companies began in April 2011 when <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/apple-sues-samsung-for-patent-infringement.php">Apple sued Samsung</a> [JURIST report] alleging the company copied its designs for the original iPhone and iPad in its Galaxy S line of smartphones and tablet devices. That litigation remains ongoing, with a judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-denies-injuction-request-by-apple-in-samsung-patent-case.php">denying</a> [JURIST report] Apple's request for a preliminary injunction in December.

<p>As smartphones and tablets continue to increase in popularity, companies increasingly seek to protect the technology involved in their creation. In November, the <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">US International Trade Commission</a> (USITC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-trade-commission-clears-apple-in-htc-patent-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] for Apple on a <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/htc-files-patent-infringement-complaint-against-apple.php">patent complaint</a> [JURIST report] brought by <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/#/?slide=4">HTC</a> [corporate website; Bloomberg <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2498:TT">backgrounder</a>]. The USITC found that Apple had not violated Section 337 of the <a href="http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/trademarks/PreLanhamAct_088_Act_of_1930.pdf">Tariff Act of 1930</a> [PDF] by reasons of infringement of Patent Nos. <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,658,146.PN.&OS=PN/6,658,146&RS=PN/6,658,146">6,658,146</a>, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,683,978.PN.&OS=PN/6,683,978&RS=PN/6,683,978">6,683,978</a>, <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,775,417.PN.&OS=PN/6,775,417&RS=PN/6,775,417">6,775,417</a> and <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7,043,087.PN.&OS=PN/7,043,087&RS=PN/7,043,087">7,043,087</a> [texts]. These patents relate to HTC's recently acquired subsidiary S3 Graphics Co. The USITC ruling rejects the request to limit imports of MAC computers, the iPhone and the iPad. The decision also <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-21/apple-wins-patent-fight-with-s3-graphics-at-u-s-trade-agency.html">calls into question the rationale of the S3 acquisition</a> [Bloomberg report] and could put pressure on HTC stock shares. HTC said it may challenge the ruling in the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website], which specializes in patent law. This USITC ruling followed an earlier one in July which held that <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/usitc-rules-htc-infringed-two-apple-patents-htc-will-appeal.php">HTC infringed two Apple patents</a> [JURIST report] relating to the Android operating system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The statement was part of a presentation at the UN Human Rights Council session of his <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/A-HRC-19-60_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] on freedom of religion, belief and recognition issues. The report summarizes improvements that have been made since the last report was made and clears up issues concerning differing definitions of "recognition" of religion and beliefs. According to the report:<blockquote>In keeping with the universalistic understanding of human rights, States must ensure that all individuals can enjoy their freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief on the basis of respect for their self-understanding in this entire area. Respect for freedom of religion or belief as a human right does not depend on administrative registration procedures, as freedom of religion or belief has the status of a human right, prior to and independent from any acts of State approval.</blockquote>Bielefeldt urged states to "offer appropriate options and procedures for religious or belief communities to achieve a status of legal personality if they so wish."

<p>Controversy over separation of church and state and state recognition of religions is an issue for many countries. In August Hungarian churches <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hungary-urged-to-revoke-church-law.php">challenged a law</a> [JURIST report] that officially recognized only 14 of the 358 religious groups in the country.

The suspects are accused of attacking a ship and kidnapping 13 Iranian fisherman, all of whom the US Navy rescued. They will be tried in Seychelles' court <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/seychelles-announces-creation-of-un-backed-piracy-court.php">established in 2010</a> [JURIST report] to prosecute international pirates. US State Department Spokesperson Victoria Nuland said the US "appreciate[s] Seychelles' regional leadership on counter-piracy ... as well as their plans to host a regional intelligence coordination center to support future piracy prosecutions." Nuland was referring to Seychelles' plans to work with the UK to form the <a href="http://www.statehouse.gov.sc/index.php/2011-07-15-09-16-47/news-archive/909-seychelles-and-britain-partner-to-target-the-financiers-of-piracy">Regional Anti-Piracy Prosecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre</a> [press release] in its country to help combat the piracy problem.

<p>Although Seychelles has been a leader in the fight against <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=maritime+piracy">maritime piracy</a> [JURIST news archive], countries around the world have been making strides in helping to solve the problem. Italy ordered its <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/italy-court-orders-trial-for-accused-somali-pirates.php">first international piracy trial</a> last month against nine Somali pirates, while France began its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/france-to-prosecute-suspected-somali-pirates.php">first international piracy trial</a> [JURIST reports] in November. In October the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-security-council-resolution-urges-stricter-anti-piracy-measures.php">adopted a resolution</a> encouraging states to criminalize and punish piracy after maritime piracy reached an <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/maritime-piracy-at-all-time-high-somalia-waters-driving-explosion.php">all-time high</a> [JURIST reports] in April. The UN also <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-announces-93-million-in-donations-to-fund-piracy-courts.php">donated $9.3 million</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 to fund piracy courts in Seychelles and Kenya, the only two countries that have created such courts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was approved by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/virginia-house-passes-amended-version-of-bill-requring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">House of Delegates</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">Senate</a> [JURIST reports], and is a scaled-back version of a similar <a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?121+sum+SB484">bill</a> [SB 484] that was considered last month. The current version of the bill removes the requirement for a transvaginal ultrasound to be performed, but continues to require a traditional transabdominal ultrasound. Upon signing, McDonnell <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/news/viewRelease.cfm?id=1165">said</a> [statement:<blockquote>Women have a right to know all the available medical and legal information surrounding the abortion decision before giving legally effective informed consent. Informed consent is already required prior to an abortion being performed in Virginia, based on the longstanding health care concept that complete information about a medical procedure must be given to a patient before she can freely consent to a procedure. As difficult as an abortion decision is, the information provided by ultrasounds, along with other information given by the doctor pursuant to current law and prevailing medical practice, can help the mother make a fully informed decision.</blockquote>The legislation is set to take effect July 1.

<p>With the passage of this legislation, Virginia becomes the eighth state to require an ultrasound before an abortion, and similar rules have drawn various results when challenged in the court system. In January the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-sonogram-law.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">similar Texas law</a> [JURIST report], allowing the law to be enforced. In October a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010 the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2012/03/secretary-general-message-on-violence-and-discrimination-based-on-sexual-orientation-or-gender-identity.html">video address</a> [video; <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/sgspeeches/statments_full.asp?statID=1475">transcript</a>], UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] acknowledged that sexual orientation and gender identity are sensitive subjects, but said action needs to be taken because lives are at stake. He called the violation of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) individuals' rights "a monumental tragedy" and "a violation of international law." Reaching out to LGBT individuals the Secretary-General said:<blockquote>To those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, let me say: You are not alone. Your struggle for an end to violence and discrimination is a shared struggle. Any attack on you is an attack on the universal values the United Nations and I have sworn to defend and uphold. Today, I stand with you, and I call upon all countries and people to stand with you, too. A historic shift is underway.</blockquote>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11917&LangID=E">recognized</a> [text] that some "may argue that homosexuality and expressions of transgender identity conflict with local culture or traditional values ... or that they run counter to public opinion." Despite this, she encouraged to go forth with the fight against discrimination. Pillay presented her <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/A-HRC-19-41_en.pdf">study</a> [report, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-report-details-global-violence-against-lgbt-individuals.php">report</a>], the first-ever on the subject, which outlines findings of violence, discriminatory laws and practices based on individuals' sexual orientation and gender identity. Within the UN itself, however, there is opposition to this undertaking. The <a href="http://www.oic-oci.org/">Organization of Islamic Cooperation</a> [official website] (OIC) addressed the assembly and stated its opposition to the notion of sexual orientation. 

<p>Individuals face criminal sanctions due to their sexual orientation in approximately 76 countries, according to the UN. In September 2010 Ban called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2010 the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/">UN Economic and Social Council</a> [official website] voted 23-13 to accredit the <a href="http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home/index.html">International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy website] as a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/ecosoc-accredits-us-based-gay-rights-group.php">consultative non-governmental organization</a> [JURIST report]. In 2009 US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">endorsed a UN declaration</a> [JURIST report] calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality, reversing the decision of his predecessor. By doing so, the US joined 66 other nations in supporting the document that divided the UN General Assembly. Nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement, including China, Russia, members of the Islamic Conference and the Vatican.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Delivering closing arguments, Prosecutor Mathias Marcussen claimed that Seselj was responsible for tens of thousands of rapes, murders and unlawful detentions during the Balkan conflict. Seselj, who has maintained his innocence, did not call any witnesses or present a defense during his trial, claiming the prosecution is politically motivated. He has three days to deliver closing arguments next week.

<p>In January the ICTY announced that Seselj is suing them for USD $2.6 million in damages due to alleged <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icty-war-crimes-suspect-demands-compensation-for-trial-delays.php">unreasonable delays</a> [JURIST report] in his trial. His war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/serb-nationalist-leader-on-trial-at.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 after he was <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/ind/en/seslj3rdind071207e.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes and accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict. His trial was briefly <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 because of concerns witnesses were being intimidated. The trial resumed in 2010 after the delay, and was again ordered to continue in 2011 after Seselj sought to have the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/cis/en/cis_seselj_en.pdf">charges dismissed</a> [case sheet, PDF]. The trial recently resumed in January, after Seslj's <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/icty-sentences-seselj-to-18-months-for-contempt-of-court.php">third contempt conviction</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Moneim's defense lawyers argued that he was just attempting to protect himself and the police station. He had no intent to kill the protesters, and, due to the chaos of the situation, it was impossible to know truly who shot who. Moneim <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/08/199378.html">initially fled</a> [<em>Al Arabiya</em> report] and was convicted and sentenced to death, but then turned himself in and was retried. The court also ordered the procedures of a second trial, in which Moneim was sentenced to life in prison for the alleged attempted murder of two other protesters, to be examined. Two other police officers that worked at the same station as Moneim were also acquitted.

<p>Moneim had been the only Egyptian police officer convicted of killing protesters, despite the fact that <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/03/07/international/i123040S77.DTL">at least 846 protesters were killed</a> [AP report]. Last March three high ranking police officials were <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/egypt-police-officials-charged-with-murdering-protesters.php">charged with murder and attempted murder</a> [JURIST report] for their roles in a January 28 incident where police firing in Beni Suef resulted in 19 deaths and 300 injuries. Egypt was heavily criticized for the way it treated protesters during the Egyptian revolution. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] released reports that protesters had been <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-group-alleges-new-evidence-of-detainee-abuse-by-egypt-military.php">tortured</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/egypty-military-allowing-prisoner-abuses-hrw.php">improperly detained</a> [JURIST reports]. AI has also criticized the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast">Supreme Council of the Armed Forces</a> (SCAF) [NYT backgrounder], stating that human rights violations against protesters committed by the SCAF may be equal to those committed under former president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hungary requested financial aid from the EU and the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> [official website] <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/eu-hungary-must-answer-more-questions-aid-125910528.html">last year</a> [AP report]. The EU stated that laws which lowered the mandatory retirement age of judges and affected the independence of the country's data protection authority were not in compliance with EU law. The law affecting the retirement age of judges, which is expected to lead to the retirement of 274 judges and public prosecutors, violates EU laws on equal treatment in employment which prohibit age discrimination. The EU stated that a law which prematurely terminated the country's previous data protection supervisory authority and gives the president too much power to dismiss the data protection supervisor was also not in compliance with EU law. The memo further stated that the EU was also concerned independence of the judiciary, because the new constitution gives the president the power to designate a court for a given case and also transfer judges without consent, and the independence of the national central bank, because the government has been issuing press releases criticizing the central bank's policy and the Governor of the national central bank's wage regime potentially allows the government to pressure and influence him. Hungary has until February 17 to respond to the EU's concerns.

<p>Hungary's new constitution was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/hungary-parliament-approves-new-constitution.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] last April and went into effect on January 1. The measure was supported by and passed as a result of the ruling <a href="http://www.fidesz.hu/index.php">Hungarian Civic Party</a> [official website, in Hungarian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=fidesz">news archive</a>], which has controlled a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly since 2010. The constitution introduced several changes, including a cap on the country's debt, a reforming the Fiscal Council to give it the right to veto the budget and dissolve parliament for failure to pass an annual budget by the end of March, defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman and stating that the life of a fetus should be protected from conception. Critics of the constitution <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/tens-of-thousands-protest-hungary-constitution.php">protested</a> [JURIST report] and argue that the constitution is giving the government too much power over the media, economy and religion in violation of international human rights laws.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Supporters of the proposed legislation say that it will combat voter fraud, but opponents fear that it will disenfranchise poor, elderly and minority voters who may find it difficult to obtain a photo ID. The bill was approved by a vote of 26-23 and will now be sent to the <a href="http://www.house.state.pa.us/index.cfm">House of Representatives</a> [official website], which already approved a tougher version of the bill last year and is expected to pass this version. If approved by the House, the bill would go to <a href="http://www.governor.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/governor_pa_gov/20650">Governor Tom Corbett</a> [official website], who has already expressed his support of the measure, and would take effect by the November elections. The <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> [advocacy website] and Democratic senators have already pledged to challenge the measure in court.

<p>If this legislation is approved, Pennsylvania would become the sixteenth state to require photo ID at the polls. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=16602">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, but the issue remains controversial. Earlier this week a Wisconsin judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-voter-id-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] that state's voter ID law. Last month the Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-passes-voter-identification-bill.php">approved a voter ID law</a> [JURIST report]. Also in February South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/south-carolina-sues-federal-government-over-blocked-voter-id-law.php">filed suit</a> against the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over its ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/DOJ-rejects-new-South-Carolina-voter-ID-law.php">barred South Carolina</a> [JURIST reports] from enforcing its voter ID law. In November Mississippi voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mississippi-passes-voter-id-requirement.php">approved a ballot measure</a> [JURIST report] to implement a voter ID law. In June Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo identification at voting booth. Last March the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring voters to present one of six government-issued photo identifications in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The award may ultimately be split among any minority applicants who took the screening test in 1999 or 2002 and were not accepted for a position immediately after being put on an eligibility list. Some firefighters, who were eventually hired from that list, may also be compensated, with the pay they did receive being factored out of their award. In the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/01/federal-judge-rules-new-york-city.php">January 2010 ruling</a> [JURIST report] pre-dating the award judgment, Judge Nicholas Garaufis "concluded that the undisputed statistical evidence Plaintiffs put forward showed that black and Hispanic candidates disproportionately failed Written Exams 7029 and 2043, were ranked disproportionately lower on the eligibility lists the exams created, and that the standard deviation analysis offered showed a very small likelihood that any of the disparities occurred by chance." The <a href = "http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, who represented black fraternal firefighter organization the <a href = "http://www.vulcansocietyfdny.org/Home_Page.html">Vulcan Society</a> [advocacy websites] in the suit, <a href = "http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/court-rules-fdny-liable-$128-million-back-pay-black-and-latino-applicants">praised the ruling</a> [press release], stating that they are, "gratified that this case has finally forced the Fire Department and the City to reckon with the NYFD's decades-long legacy of discrimination and that it sends a strong message that access to the City's best jobs must be open to all." The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], a party to the suit, also accused the NYFD of using discriminatory screening exams and was influential in the award ruling. The DOJ estimates that up to 2,200 applicants may be eligible for compensation.

<p>In August, the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-african-american-firefighter-suit.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit filed by an African-American firefighter claiming the firefighter promotion exams used in the city of New Haven, Connecticut, are discriminatory. In 2003, the New Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) had refused to certify the results of the exam that made disproportionately more white applicants than minority applicants eligible for promotion. Applicants who qualified for promotions based on their test scores but were denied promotions filed a lawsuit against the city claiming disparate impact.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hood challenged these pardons, alleging that the governor's actions violated the requirements for clemency in the <a href = "http://www.mscode.com/msconst/">Mississippi Constitution</a> [materials]. The court ruled that Barbour's pardons were lawful, reversing the lower court's decision, which granted Hood's request for a temporary restraining order.

However, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href = "http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/efforts-arrest-joseph-kony-must-respect-human-rights-2012-03-08">cautioned</a> [press release] Friday that "[a]nyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights. It is also vital to make sure that any action ensures the protection of civilians in the surrounding areas." The Kony 2012 campaign initiative is a viral video by Invisible Children that calls for an international effort to arrest Kony, the leader of the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3462901.stm">Lord's Resistance Army</a> (LRA) [BBC backgrounder], so he may be prosecuted by the ICC:

Ocampo appears in the video and commended Invisible Children for energizing public support. AI has stressed that the arrest of Kony should be in respect to the international human rights. It further cautioned that any effort of an arrest might endanger civilians where LRA is present: "It is important to remember that many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment. Forces pursuing the LRA must seek to arrest the suspects in accordance with international law."

<p>The ICC issued an <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc97185.PDF">arrest warrant</a> [text, PDF] against Kony in 2005 on 33 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, sexual enslavement, rape and abduction. In 2009, ICC stated that it is <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icc-still-seeking-arrest-of-uganda-war.php">still seeking to arrest</a> [JURIST report] Kony. He <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/uganda-rebel-leader-wanted-by-icc.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the allegations against him. Despite ICC's <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/icc-calls-for-cooperation-in-arresting.php">calling for global cooperation</a> [JURIST report] after issuing the warrant to arrest Kony, he has remained at large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Currently, white children are three times more likely to be adopted than minority children because of the United Kingdom's standard of making an ethnic match. The country's current adoption law, the <a href = "http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/38/contents">Adoption and Children Act 2002</a> [text] requires consideration of matching prospective adopted children with parents on religion, race, ethnicity, language and culture. Cameron and the UK government are proposing several changes to the adoption process in order to achieve quicker adoptions. Local authorities will soon be required to reduce delay rather than wait for a "perfect match." If an adoptive match is not found within three months, local authorities are required to place the child on the national adoption register. Cameron's reforms also detail procedural and legal changes to lower the threshold for children to be fostered by people approved for adoption. The proposal was welcomed by various organizations including the <a href="http://www.nspcc.org.uk/">National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</a> (NSPCC) [advocacy website], but they also expressed concerns that if speed is the main key factor, it may lead to hasty decisions of adoption having only detrimental results to children. A more detailed version of the reform will be published next week by the <a href = "http://www.michaelgove.com/">Education Secretary Michael Gove</a> [official website].

<p>A similar reform was affirmed in Italy when the <a href="http://www.cortedicassazione.it/Cassazione/Cassazione.asp">Court of Cassation</a> [official website, in Italian] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/italy-high-court-rules-adoptive-couples-cannot-request-children-based-on-race-ethnicity.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in June that couples seeking a child to adopt based on race or ethnicity should be not even allowed to apply for adoption. It held that such practice was against the Italian Constitution. The issue of who could adopt was a recent issue in the UK. The UK <a href="http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/">Charity Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/uk-charity-commission-rules-adoption-agency-cannot-discriminate-against-gay-couples.php">ruled in August</a> [JURIST report] that Catholic social services agency <a href="http://www.catholic-care.org.uk/">Catholic Care</a> [advocacy website] could not discriminate against gay couples seeking to adopt. This holding reversed a prior decision by the UK High Court in March which <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/uk-high-court-rules-catholic-adoption.php">permitted</a> [JURIST report] the agency to refuse considering same-sex couples as candidates for adoption.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Efforts to transfer the Guantanamo prisoners are part of an overarching plan initiated by the Obama administration to peacefully negotiate with the Afghan government and Taliban leadership.

<p>Afghanistan authorities have been critical of US-run military prisons.

On Tuesday, Judge David Flanagan blocked enforcement of the law, saying that it was more restrictive than voter identification laws that have been upheld in other states. Wisconsin Assistant Attorney General Carrie Benedon <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/judge-will-rule-on-league-s-voter-id-lawsuit-monday/article_13efa57e-69ff-11e1-86db-0019bb2963f4.html">defended the state's voter identification law</a> [<em>Wisconsin State Journal</em> report], saying that the law was necessary to prevent voter fraud. Lester Pines, an attorney challenging the voter identification law, stated that regardless of Judge Niess's decision on Monday, Wisconsin appellate courts will have the final say in the matter.

<p>Wisconsin's voter ID law has been subject to numerous legal challenges. In December, the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.aclu-wi.org/">ACLU of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.nlchp.org/">National Law Center on Homelessness &#38; Poverty</a> [advocacy websites]<a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php"> filed a federal lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] challenging the Wisconsin law. Lawsuits have also been filed by the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-groups-bring-new-challenge-against-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">Advancement Project</a> and the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/womens-group-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">League of Women Voters</a> [JURIST reports]. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=16602">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In August, South Carolina's Senate Minority Caucus <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/south-carolina-democrats-protest-against-voter-id-law.php">filed an objection</a> [JURIST report] with the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website], asking it to reject the state's new voter identification law. In June, Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo identification at voting booths.

Kiai expressed particular disdain for the provision that would impose a fine of 100,000 Swiss Francs, or approximately $110,000, on anyone who protests without first obtaining authorization from the Swiss government or fails to comply with police injunctions. Kiai said the fines were excessive and would "have a chilling effect on the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of expression." Kiai also expressed his disappointment with the Swiss government, who had previously championed many peaceful assembly initiatives: <blockquote>The exercise of fundamental freedoms should not be subject to a previous authorization by the authorities. ... The State has the prime responsibility to protect peaceful assemblies, and cannot circumvent its duty by forcing organizers to provide security personnel. ... Switzerland is leading important initiatives with respect to the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. The proposed changes to the law on demonstrations in the canton of Geneva are not in consonance with these positive efforts.</blockquote> The proposed changes in Swiss law will be put to a referendum on Sunday.

<p>The UN, as well as human rights groups, have criticized nations' recent crackdowns on peaceful assembly. In December, a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/malaysia-bill-will-curb-peaceful-assembly-rights-un-experts.php">denounced a Malaysian law</a> [JURIST report] that limits citizens' freedom to protest. In November, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-report-syria-committing-human-rights-violations.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] condemning Syria for violating a myriad of human rights, including the right to peacefully assemble. Earlier in November, UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] urged Egyptian officials to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/un-rights-experts-urge-restraint-in-egypt.php">protect the right to assemble</a> [JURIST report]. That same month, <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/amnesty-international-criticises-uganda-human-rights-violations.php">accused the Ugandan government</a> [JURIST report] of infringing on citizens' freedom of speech and assembly rights.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gdKoOxS_8j_KFZXMC5q5DQdL3TTQ?docId=bafc524bc726441ea89beb6f880970a2">refused to find that the forced virginity tests occurred</a> [AP report] despite a prior court ruling and allegations from <a href="http://amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] quoting military generals. Military prosecutors brought the charges against Dr. Ahmed Adel after an <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/egypt-court-orders-stop-to-%20forced-virginity-tests.php">administrative court issued a ruling last December banning the tests</a> [JURIST report], which it found were performed on detained protestors. The allegations sparked uproar from many of the protestors who claim the tests show that the military regime still follows the oppressive practices of ousted President <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> [JURIST news archive]. Samira Ibrahim, one of the women claiming to have been submitted to the test, expressed displeasure with Sunday's ruling today on her <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SamiraIbrahim4">Twitter page</a> [Twitter, in Arabic]. Military authorities initially denied the tests occurred but an anonymous senior military official later <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/11/world/meast/egypt-virginity-tests/?hpt=hp_t3">admitted they were performed</a> [CNN report] to protect the military from accusations of sexual assault from the detained protestors. The military is scheduled to hand over power to civilian authorities by July 1, 2012. 

<p>Last week, an Egyptian police officer was also <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/egypt-court-acquits-police-official-charged-with-murdering-protesters.php">acquitted by a criminal court</a> [JURIST report] over allegations that he killed 20 protestors. The police officer's defense lawyers claimed he had no intent to kill protestors and was only attempting to protect himself and the police station. Last December, the Cairo Administrative Court ordered the Egyptian Army to end its practice of performing forced virginity tests on female detainees. Samira Ibrahim brought the case against the Egyptian Army after she was arrested during a protest and was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/12/20111227132624606116.html">forced to submit to a virginity test</a> [<em>Al Jazeera</em> report]. Judge Aly Fekry, head of the Court, delivered the order to stop the procedure of virginity tests on woman inside military prisons. The forced virginity tests have been condemned by human rights organizations including AI, which <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/egypt-admission-forced-virginity-tests-must-lead-justice-2011-05-31">called upon the Egyptian government</a> [AI report] to investigate the practice after other women protesters had come forward with allegations about forced virginity tests. AI has also accused Egyptian officials of <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/amnesty-report-egypt-military-rulers-abused-protesters-violated-human-rights.php">violating human rights</a>  [JURIST report] including abuse of protesters and journalists who voiced their dissatisfaction with the government. All of these acts stem from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/egypt-protesters-decry-ruling-military-council-clash-with-police.php">protest</a> [JURIST report] that took place in November in which over 50,000 people gathered to decry the military's contented rule over the nation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his address to the annual meeting of the NPC, Chief Justice Wang Shegjun <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/top-judge-says-china-needs-more-legal-reforms-still-problems-with-transparency/2012/03/11/gIQArKml4R_story.html">recommended</a> [AP report] that courts work to speed up civil cases and increase the transparency of trials. Shengjun discussed the achievements of the Chinese courts in the last year, including an increase in resolution of intellectual property cases, and a decrease in prosecutions of judges and court staff for corruption. He stressed that the courts must continue to resolve cases and eliminate corruption in order to create a "favorable legal environment." 

<p>The Chinese government has worked in recent years to reform their judicial system and combat corruption. Last May, the SPC <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/china-to-issue-harsher-penalties-including-death-for-food-safety-violations.php">issued a directive</a> [JURIST report] instituting new harsher penalties under the criminal law for violations of food safety crimes. In December 2010, a former Chinese corruption official was <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/china-official-executed.php">executed for accepting more than 4.7 million USD in bribes</a> in return for mining contracts and job promotions. In September 2010, a member of the NPC announced that the government <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/china-not-considering-eliminating-death-penalty-for-corruption.php">did not consider removing the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] as a punishment for corruption. That summer, the Chinese government <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/china-executes-top-judicial-official-for-corruption-rape.php">executed a top judicial official</a> [JURIST report] after it was revealed he accepted bribes and had been protecting a number of organized crime gangs. In March 2010, the Hebei Province People's High Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/china-appeals-court-upholds-life.php">upheld a life sentence</a> for former vice president of the SPC who had been <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-ex-vice-president.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of bribery and embezzlement. Earlier that month, the SPC president called for <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-top-judge-urges-increased-efforts.php">increased efforts to fight corruption</a> [JURIST report] in the country's court system. In January 2010, the SPC <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/china-high-court-announces-new-anti.php">announced new anti-corruption rules</a> [JURIST report] in an effort to increase public confidence in the rule of law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Governor Georgy Poltavchenko <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/st_petersburg_homosexuality_law/24512104.html">signed the bill on Wednesday</a> [RFE/RL report] despite complaints that it discriminated against the gay community. The bill, which was <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/st-petersburg-enacts-limits-on-gays/453877.html">passed by lawmakers</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] at the end of February, bans gay pride parades, and any activity in public which could influence children and that could be viewed as promoting a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) lifestyle. Individuals convicted under the law would be subject to <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/st-pete-may-fine-gays-who-are-open/447995.html">fines between 3,000 and 5,000 rubles ($100-$160 USD)</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report], while organizations could be fined up to 50,000 rubles for "promoting" homosexuality. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">introduced in November 2011</a> [JURIST report], and sponsors of the claim it is necessary because <a href="http://en.ria.ru/analysis/20111118/168818571.html">homosexual propaganda "threatens" Russia</a> [RIA Novosti report] and that "sexual deviation" negatively impacts Russian children. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on Poltavchenko to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/02/russia-block-st-petersburg-s-homophobic-law">veto the legislation</a> [news release], which they called a "discriminatory and dangerous initiative." According to legal scholars, the <a href="http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/constit.html">Russian Constitution</a> [text] may allow limitations to be placed on the rights of homosexuals due to the constitutional ability to balance the interests of society and limit rights of a social group if they infringe upon the rights of another social group. Enforcement of the law will begin 10 days after the date of signing. 

<p>Russia has long struggled with the acceptance of homosexuality. In 2008, several Russian gay rights activists were <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/moscow-gay-pride-advocates-arrested-for.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by police in Moscow for holding events commemorating the 1993 law that put an end to government prosecution for homosexual activity in Russia. It was the third consecutive year Moscow Pride held events around the city to elude officials attempting to <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/moscow-court-bans-gay-pride-parade.php">enforce a local ban on gay pride parades</a> [JURIST report] that was put in place due to fears of violence. The UN has attempted to pass resolutions aimed at ending sexuality discrimination worldwide, but has faced difficulty passing resolutions on gay rights issues. Last year, <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] passed the <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/HRC/RES/17/19&Lang=E">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF], which is the first resolution to call for an <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">end to sexuality discrimination worldwide</a> [JURIST report]. In 2010, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report]. A year earlier, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">passed a gay rights declaration</a> [JURIST report], which called on states to end criminalization and persecution of homosexuals. This declaration was recalled by the new resolution. Although <a href="http://geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/22/lgbtrights/">85 countries signed the declaration</a> [US Ambassador statement], 57 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, signed an opposing statement. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was divided over the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-divided-over-gay.php">issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [JURIST report] as 66 nations signed a statement calling for decriminalization, and nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The London charity <a href="http://www.reprieve.org.uk/">Reprieve</a> [advocacy website] and <a href="http://www.leighday.co.uk/Home">Leigh Day &#38; Co</a> [firm website] will sue Foreign Secretary William Hague at the High Court in London <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17335368">on behalf of Noor Khan</a> [BBC report] whose father was killed in a US drone strike on Pakistan. The accusing parties claim that Britain's electronic listening agency, GCHQ, may face liability for <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/uk-government-sued-helping-us-drone-strikes-103517632.html">secondary murder</a> [AP report] by assisting the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) [official website] in the drone attacks which killed more than 40 people. Leigh Day &#38; Co stated:<blockquote>Evidence suggests that drone strikes in Pakistan are being carried out in violation of international humanitarian law, because the individuals who are being targeted are not directly participating in hostilities and/or because the force used is neither necessary nor proportionate. This suggests that there is also a significant risk that GCHQ officers may be guilty of conduct ancillary to crimes against humanity and/or war crimes, both of which are statutory offences under the International Criminal Court Act 2001.</blockquote>UK officials have not commented publicly about the drone attacks in Pakistan.

<p>US targeted strikes on al Qaeda and other terrorist operatives outside Afghanistan and the border regions of Pakistan have triggered <a href="/forum/2012/02/laurie-blank-targeted-strikes.php">extensive debate</a> [JURIST op-ed] about the lawfulness of such strikes, the strategic effectiveness of drone strikes, the political and diplomatic ramifications, and other questions. In December, as part of its protest, Pakistan has demanded that the <a href="/forum/2011/12/sikander-shah-drone-strikes.php">US vacate the Shamsi Air Base </a> [JURIST op-ed] within 15 days. It is widely believed that the Shamsi base has been regularly used by the US for drone and associated surveillance flights. In July three Pakistani men filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/pakistanis-seek-arrest-of-ex-cia-legal-counsel-for-drone-attacks.php">complaint</a> [JURIST report] seeking to arrest former CIA legal counsel for authorizing unmanned predator drone strikes. The Obama administration has <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/state-department-legal-adviser-defends.php">defended</a> [JURIST report] its use of targeted killings, specifically those made by unmanned predator drone strikes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ethiopia's <a href="http://chilot.me/2011/02/02/charities-and-societies-proclamation-proc-no-6212009/">Charities and Societies Proclamation</a> (CSP) [text] blocks Ethiopian NGOs from accepting more than 10 percent of their funding from foreign sources and gives the government authority to appoint NGO leadership positions. The law also imposes strict and unregulated criminal and administrative penalties for violations. The report criticized the law and its effect on human rights in the county:<blockquote>In restricting human rights organizations from doing their legitimate and essential work, the law has significantly affected the promotion and protection of the rights of the Ethiopian people. Civil society organizations are essential to upholding human rights, equality and justice at all levels of society, and to holding governments to account for their performance and adherence to national and international human rights commitments.</blockquote>A government spokesman, Bereket Simon, said that AI's <a href="http://www.gazettebw.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12734:rights-works-in-ethiopia-crippled-by-law-amnesty&catid=17:world-news&Itemid=2">accusations are unfounded</a> [AFP report] and that the law serves the interests of both NGOs and citizens. AI and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] previously <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/ethiopia-proposed-ngo-law-may-undermine.php">issued reports</a> that <a href="/paperchase/2008/10/proposed-ethiopia-ngo-law-would.php">criticized the law</a> [JURIST reports] shortly after it was proposed in 2008. 

<p>AI claims that the CSP and other regulations such as the <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/procedural-law/criminal-procedure-law/special-procedures/318-anti-terrorism-proclamation-no-6522009.html">Anti-Terrorism Proclamation</a> [text] and the <a href="http://www.ethiopian-law.com/federal-laws/substantive-law-legislations/human-rights-and-governance/media-and-information/225-freedom-of-the-mass-media-and-access-to-information-proclamation-no-5902008.html">Mass Media Proclamation</a> [text], allow the Ethiopian government to limit freedom of speech and <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=19993">commit human rights violations</a> [AI press release]. In January, the <a href="http://www.fsc.gov.et/">Ethiopian Federal High Court</a> [official website, in Amharic] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/ethiopia-court-convicts-three-journalists-two-others-under-controversial-anti-terrorism-law.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] three Ethiopian journalists, a political opposition leader and a politician's assistant for conspiring to commit acts of terrorism in violation of the country's Anti-Terrorism Proclamation. HRW reported that the defendants had no access to legal counsel during their three months in pretrial detention and that the court did not investigate allegations of torture and mistreatment while in detention. Under the anti-terrorism law, conspiracy to commit terrorist acts carries a sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment or death. Last year, JURIST guest columnist and former executive director Abigail Salisbury argued that the Ethiopian government is using these regulatory laws to suppress journalists and opposition groups to <a href="/forum/2011/08/abigail-salisbury-ethiopia-terror.php">maintain its hold on power</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Habre served as president of Chad from 1982 to 1990 and has been residing in Senegal since rebels ousted him from power in 1990. <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2012/03/12/belgium-seeks-world-court-order-on-ex-chad-leader">Belgium alleges</a> [AP report] that, during that time, Habre was involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/senegal-rejects-belgium-request-to-extradite-chad-ex-president.php">murder or torture</a> [JURIST report] of more than 40,000 political opponents. When he was ousted in 1990, he sought refuge in Senegal where he has resided ever since. Belgium indicted Habre in 2005 for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture but has been unable to extradite him to Brussels to stand trial despite repeated requests to Senegalese authorities. Senegal placed Habre under arrest in 2005 after he was charged by Belgium.

<p>Senegal has been under pressure to send Habre to a country where he will face trial for his alleged war crimes committed during his rule of Chad. In January, a court in Senegal rejected a Belgian court's request to extradite Habre, the former president of Chad, on accusations that he killed and tortured opponents during his regime. In July of last year, Senegal <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/senegal-reverses-decision-to-deport-chad-ex-dictator.php">reversed</a> [JURIST report] its decision to send the former dictator back to Chad after UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay warned he could be tortured. The decision came after Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/un-rights-chief-urges-senegal-not-to-deport-chad-ex-president-habre.php">issued a plea</a> [JURIST report] not to return Habre to Chad, which has already sentenced him to death in absentia and where she fears he will be tortured.</p>]]></content:encoded>

About <a href="http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/swiss-vote-for-less-holiday-tougher-rules-on-protests_214018.html">55 percent of voters</a> [Expatica report] in Geneva agreed to allow the government to impose a fine of 100,000 Swiss Francs, or approximately USD $110,000, on anyone who protests without first obtaining authorization from the Swiss government or fails to comply with police injunctions. The UN, which is based in Geneva, opposes the law. Last week, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/AssemblyAssociation/Pages/MainaKiaibio.aspx">Maina Kiai</a> [official profile], the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, stated that the rights to speak freely and peaceably assemble are cornerstones of democracy and that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-expert-warns-of-switzerland-laws-chilling-effect-on-free-speech.php">proposed changes would unduly infringe</a> [JURIST report] on those rights. Kiai also said the fines were excessive and would "have a chilling effect on the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of expression." Supporters of the law argue that the stricter rules will <a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Swiss+vote+holidays+protests+restrictions+Agnes+Pedrero/6284895/story.html">help prevent violent protests</a> [AFP report] in the city. 

<p>The UN, as well as human rights groups, have criticized nations' recent crackdowns on peaceful assembly. In December, a group of UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/malaysia-bill-will-curb-peaceful-assembly-rights-un-experts.php">denounced a Malaysian law</a> [JURIST report] that limits citizens' freedom to protest.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontvotebutton.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] objected Monday to the recently passed Texas <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Text.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=SB14">voter identification law</a> [SB 14 materials]. In a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/85051426/DOJ-Letter-To-Texas-On-Voter-ID-Law">letter</a> [text] from Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, the DOJ claimed that the changes requiring voters to present a valid photo identification are unenforceable under Section 5 of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/voting_rights_act">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [Cornell LII backgrounder] because it would adversely effect Hispanic voters. According to the letter, Hispanic voters encompass 21.8 percent of registered voters within the state and are more than twice as likely not to have valid photo identification than non-Hispanic registered voters. The DOJ recognized that the state had a legitimate purpose in preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence, but noted there is no evidence that these issues are not already addressed by existing legislation. In addition, the DOJ argued that the proposed legislation shows no evidence that the Texas legislature sought alternative means to combat the problem that would not have retrogressive effects. Finally, Perez wrote, "Because we conclude that the state has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the proposed law will not have a retrogressive effect, we do not make any determination as to whether the state has established that the proposed changes were adopted with no discriminatory purpose." The State of Texas may request that the attorney general reconsider this objection or may seek a declaratory judgment from the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] that the legislation does not have a discriminatory purpose or effect.  

<p>There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id-state-requirements.aspx">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the poll, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial. In February South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/south-carolina-sues-federal-government-over-blocked-voter-id-law.php">filed suit</a> against the DOJ over its ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/DOJ-rejects-new-South-Carolina-voter-ID-law.php">barred South Carolina</a> [JURIST reports] from enforcing its voter ID law. Last year Missouri's Governor <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> a proposed photo ID law, and the Georgia Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld a law</a> [JURIST reports] requiring one of six government-issued photo IDs. In 2010, the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. Last month, Texas also issued <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-court-issues-new-texas-voting-district-maps.php">new voting maps</a> [JURIST report] for use in the 2012 elections after an "interim map" was challenged before the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], which <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-texas-redistricting-case.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in January. The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/obama-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-reject-texas-legislature-redistricting-maps.php">reject the interim maps</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision came after the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] filed an appeal arguing that the sentence was "substantively unreasonable." The court reasoned that the 22-year sentence was too lenient and was based on findings of the lower court that were erroneous. The DOJ argued that, according to federal guidelines, a 65-year sentence would be appropriate based on the severity of the crimes. The appeals court remanded the case to the district court for re-sentencing. 

<p>Rassam's sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-millennium.php">previously vacated and remanded</a> [JURIST report] by the Ninth Circuit in 2010. The court found that the district court failed to properly consider the sentencing guidelines, which would have required a minimum prison sentence of 65 years. The court also ordered that a different judge be assigned to the case. The prosecution offered Ressam a reduced sentence in exchange for his cooperation against other terrorist suspects, but, over time, Ressam failed to properly cooperate with US government officials. In December 2008, the US District Court for the Western District of Washington <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/millennium-bomber-re-sentenced-to-22.php">re-issued a sentence</a> [JURIST report] of 22 years in prison. In May 2008, the US Supreme Court voted 8-1 to <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-supreme-court-rules-on-repeat.php">uphold</a> [JURIST report] Ressam's conviction. The court <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/federal-appeals-court-rejects-22-year.php">reversed the judgment</a> [JURIST report] of the Ninth Circuit and ruled that Ressam could be convicted and sentenced under a law punishing the carrying of explosives while committing a felony even if the explosives were not related to the felony offense.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Justice William Charles <a href="http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/nicklinson-v-moj.pdf">ruled</a> [judgment, PDF] that a case brought by Tony Nicklinson, age 57, could proceed to hearing. Nicklinson is the victim of a paralyzing stroke and challenges the UK's definition of murder, seeking medical assistance in committing suicide. Nicklinson argues that British law <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/index.ssf/story/uk-court-to-rule-on-euthanasia-bid/2050922654f14d6890106d74961d5d69">hinders his rights</a> [AP press release] to private and family life as established in the <a href="http://www.hri.org/docs/ECHR50.html">European Convention of Human Rights</a> [text] for his decision is one of personal autonomy and dignity. The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice</a> [official website] argued that granting Nicklinson's request would change the law on murder and that was the job of the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/">Parliament</a> [official website].

<p>The <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=right+to+die">right to die</a> [JURIST news archive] has been a contentious issue around the world. The only European countries that allow euthanasia are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In 2011, an India high court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/india-high-court-rules-passive-euthanasia-permitted-under-certain-circumstances.php">ruled passive euthanasia was permitted</a> [JURIST report] under certain circumstances, but rejected a petition for a mercy killing. In 2010, a German court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/german-court-upholds-right-to-die.php">removing a patient from life support is not a criminal offense</a> [JURIST report] if the patient had previously given consent.  In 2009, the Italian president <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/italy-president-blocks-measure-to-stop.php">refused to sign an Italian government decree</a> [JURIST report] that would stop the euthanasia of comatose women because it would violate the separation of power overturning a previous court ruling. In 2006, a proposed bill that would legalize the option of assisted suicide in the UK was <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/uk-lords-put-aside-controversial.php">set aside by the House of Lords</a> following <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/british-doctors-reject-proposed.php">opposition from the public and two physician groups</a> [JURIST reports]. Also in 2006, the US Supreme Court upheld <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">Oregon's Death with Dignity Act</a> [JURIST report], the only American state law that allows physician assisted suicide. </p>]]></content:encoded>

While speaking to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Shaheed also stated that his concerns have increased because he has repeatedly requested to visit the country, but his requests have been denied. In the report, he states,"[T]he unwillingness to provide access to the country creates a void of information and only encourages the international community to imagine the worst, thereby intensifying the focus on the Government's human rights record." Shaheed said he has resorted to other sources in order to gain information about the alleged abuses, such as witness accounts. Shaheed voiced concern over 58 alleged violations of human rights including "the alarming increase in executions since 2003" and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/un-human-rights-investigator-finds-pattern-of-abuses-in-iran-says-requests-to-visit-denied/2012/03/12/gIQAPUWO7R_story.html">arbitrary arrests of journalists</a> [WP report].

<p>Corroborating Shaheed's concerns, Amnesty International released a report in February that <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/iran-executions-doubled-in-2011-amnesty.php">Iran executed twice as many people</a> [JURIST report] in 2011 as it did in the previous year. The report, entitled "'We Are Ordered to Crush You': Expanding Repression of Dissent in Iran," chronicles widespread international human rights violations that Iran's government has allegedly perpetrated over the past year. The AI report claims that the most common targets of Iran's crackdown on human rights are lawyers, rights activists, filmmakers, journalists and political leaders. Iran has recently been in other news when US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/obama-signs-order-imposing-stricter-sanctions-on-iran.php">signed an executive order imposing strict sanctions on Iran</a> [JURIST report] as part of an effort to enforce a bill he signed into law in December 2011. The bill, National Defense Authorization Act for 2012 (NDAA), allows for sanctions such as those ordered by Obama to be imposed on Iran. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Spotlighting the <a href = "http://www.tuzilastvobih.gov.ba/?opcija=sadrzaj&kat=2&id=4&jezik=e">Special Department for War Crimes</a> (SDWC) [official website], the report commended the nation's commitment to prosecuting crimes from the <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=bosnian+civil+war">Bosnian civil war</a> [JURIST news archives] and suggested that other nations could learn from BiH's experiences. HRW described some of the difficulties in war crimes tribunals, including nominating judiciary. In BiH's case, non-Bosnian prosecutors and judges were brought in temporarily from the beginning of the SDWC, but it has been difficult phasing into local justice due to ethnic tensions. The report also looked particularly on the effects of international judges on a war crimes trial.<blockquote>Overall, in any context, international judges should avoid trying to simply replicate their own national systems or the practices of international tribunals. While these systems may provide helpful insights, international judges should approach their role with an understanding of how the existing national judicial system works and be dedicated to preserving and enhancing functional parts of the system. This is important as an expression of respect for the national system and the experience of national colleagues. It can also help avoid inefficiencies.</blockquote>The report ultimately recommended that other nations create a coordinated effort to try war crimes using highly structured national courts aided by international advisers. It also highlighted the importance of responding to the public's desire for justice or closure after a conflict such as the Bosnian civil war.

<p>In January the <a href = "http://www.sudbih.gov.ba/?jezik=e">Court of BiH</a> [official website] <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/bosnia-war-crimes-court-upholds-31-year-sentence-for-srebrenica-massacre.php">upheld</a> the <a href = "/paperchase/2010/04/bosnian-serbs-sentenced-to-31-years-for.php">conviction</a> [JURIST reports] and 31-year sentence of Radomir Vukovic for his part in the 1995 <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Srebrenica">Srebrenica massacre</a> [JURIST news archive] during the Bosnian civil war. While Vukoic's appeal was denied, Zoran Tomic won his appeal on a lack of evidence. Earlier that month convicted Serbian <a href = "/paperchase/2012/01/radovan-stankovic-arrested-after-4-years-on-the-run.php">war criminal Radovan Stankovic</a> [JURIST report] was arrested in BiH after being on the run since May 2007 when he escaped from a Bosnian prison. Stankovic was <a href="/paperchase/2006/11/bosnia-war-crimes-court-sentences.php">convicted of multiple war crimes</a> [JURIST report] in 2006, including rape, enslavement and torture. In December the <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/us-extradites-bosnian-woman-suspected-of-war-crimes.php">US extradited Rasema Handanovic</a> [JURIST report], a woman accused of killing Bosnian Croat civilians during the Bosnian Civil War. A number of cases have been opened in relation to the Bosnian Civil War. The Court of BiH confirmed the <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ex-police-officer-indicted-for-role-in-srebrenica-massacre.php">indictment</a> [JURIST report] of former police officer Bozidar Kuvelja in March for his role in a 1995 massacre. In February, French authorities <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/france-authorities-arrest-srebrenica-massacre-suspect.php">arrested Milorad Momic</a> [JURIST report] under an international arrest warrant for his suspected involvement in war crimes.

Act 23 modified current voting laws by requiring a photo ID at the polls and a 28-day residency before the election and shortening the amount of time to file absentee ballots. Judge Richard Niess ordered a permanent injunction of the law, in favor of the <a href = "http://www.lwvwi.org/">League of Women Voters of Wisconsin</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/womens-group-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">report</a>], stating that Act 23 amounts to voter suppression:<blockquote>However, Act 23 goes beyond mere regulation of elections. Its photo ID requirements impermissibly eliminate the right of suffrage altogether for certain constitutionally qualified electors. As just one example, an individual who has incontrovertible and even undisputed proof at the polls that he/she is a qualified elector under Article III, but lacks statutorily acceptable photo ID then or by the following Friday, may not vote under Act 23. Thus, Act 23's photo ID requirements are unconstitutional because they abridge the right to vote. Regulation may not deny the right of suffrage, either directly or indirectly. This has been the law of Wisconsin since its birth: "an act of the legislature which deprives a person of the right to vote, although he has every qualification which the constitution makes necessary, cannot be sustained." Worded differently, as a matter of law under the Wisconsin Constitution, sacrificing a qualified elector's right to vote is not a reasonable exercise of the government's prerogative to regulate elections.</blockquote>The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin stated it was <a href = "http://www.lwvwi.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=PTLkIyAiSMk%3d&tabid=41&mid=399">delighted with the ruling</a> [press release, PDF]. Wisconsin <a href = "http://www.doj.state.wi.us/ag/">Attorney General JB Van Hollen</a> [official website] plans to <a href = "http://www.doj.state.wi.us/absolutenm/templates/template_share.aspx?articleid=2835&zoneid=1">appeal</a> [press release].

<p>This is only one of four challenges to Wisconsin's <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=voter+ID">voter ID</a> [JURIST news archives] law. The temporary injunction, issued last week by Circuit Court Judge David Flanagan, was in a suit filed in December by the <a href = "http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) [advocacy website]. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.aclu-wi.org/">ACLU of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.nlchp.org/">National Law Center on Homelessness &#38; Poverty</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> in December, as did the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-groups-bring-new-challenge-against-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">Advancement Project</a> [JURIST reports] in February. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=16602">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Five consent judgments were filed in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], detailing settlement agreements reached with <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/bank-of-america-consent-judgement.pdf">Bank of America Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/chase-consent-judgement.pdf">JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co.</a>, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/wellsfargo-consent-judgement.pdf">Wells Fargo &#38; Company</a>, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/citi-consent-judgement.pdf">Citigroup Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/residential-consent-judgement.pdf">Ally Financial Inc.</a> (formerly GMAC) [consent judgments, PDFs]. The servicers must fulfill their obligations within three-and-a-half years, and the agreement does not prevent civil suits by individual homeowners or criminal charges pursued by federal or state authorities. Last month, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a>, HUD <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD">Secretary Shaun Donovan</a> [official websites] and 49 state attorneys general <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-state-ags-reach-agreement-in-foreclosure-investigation.php">announced the agreement</a> [JURIST report], which is the largest joint federal-state settlement ever obtained. 

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/state-ags-to-investigate-foreclosure-practices.php">investigation began</a> [JURIST report] in October 2010 with the forming of a bipartisan group called the Mortgage Foreclosure Multistate Group (MFMG).

Journalists Ahmet Sik, Nedim Sener, Coskun Musluk and Sait Cakir <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/journalists-freed-after-375-days-behind-bars.aspx?pageID=238&nID=15872&NewsCatID=339">were released</a> [<em>Hurriyet Daily News</em> report], although nine other journalists remain in prison. The journalists were arrested in March 2011 and are accused of being part of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>], a secular group suspected of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">planning to overthrow</a> [JURIST report] the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. Prior to their release, the men testified at a hearing and asserted their innocence. The 13 journalists in the so-called OdaTV case claim that the charges are an attempt to silence opposition based on allegedly fabricated evidence. However, the government maintains that the charges are based solely on the defendants' criminal activities and not their writings as journalists. Their trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/turkish-journalists-on-trial-for-alleged-coup-plot.php">started in November</a> [JURIST report] but was adjourned after only four hours to await a decision from Turkey's high court on whether the presiding judge could continue to hear the case after the defense counsel accused the judge of showing bias. The case has sparked international concern over media rights in Turkey. On Tuesday, the <a href="http://www.osce.org/">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) [official website] Representative on Freedom of the Media, Dunja Mijatovic, <a href="http://www.osce.org/fom/88898">praised the Turkish court</a> [OSCE press release] for agreeing to release the journalists and emphasized the importance of freedom of the press for democracy. The next hearing date in the case is June 18.

<p>Approximately 400 individuals are currently on trial in connection with the alleged 2009 Ergenekon plot to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and delegitimize the ruling AKP government. Last month, an Istanbul criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/turkishretired-general-to-be-tried-in-lower-court.php">accepted an indictment</a> [JURIST report] against retired <a href="http://www.ilkerbasbug.com/">General Ilker Basbug</a> [official website, in Turkish], the highest ranking military officer to be indicted in connection with Ergenekon, after Basbug's request to have his case heard by the Supreme State Council, a faction of Turkey's <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Turkish], was denied. Basbug, who was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/turkish-general-arrested-for-alleged-connection-to-ergenekon-plot.php">arrested in January</a> [JURIST report], claims that he is innocent and lower-ranking military officials who have been indicted state that they were just acting within the chain of command. Critics of the Islam-rooted AKP ruling party contend that the Ergenekon investigation is intended to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">silence the party's opponents and impose Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report], but the government denies any such charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA37/003/2012/en/ebe85f43-3b61-4072-a8ab-a6e504da58e6/asa370032012en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] claims that detainees are subject to torture and even extrajudicial executions, often under laws designed to combat terrorism. AI claims that little has changed since the end of the government's 26-year civil war with the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive] in 2009:<blockquote>Sri Lankan authorities continue to arrest and detain suspects without minimal safeguards. Sri Lankan law permits police to remove prisoners from their cells and transport them from place to place for the purpose of investigation&#8212;a practice that has contributed to torture and custodial killings. Detainees have been held incommunicado and tortured in unofficial places of detention which have included private homes, repurposed schools, administrative buildings and warehouses. Torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions continue in Sri Lanka in part because of these arbitrary detention practices. The culture of impunity that was established in Sri Lanka during the course of the armed conflict continues to pervert the rule of law and hamper the provision of justice.</blockquote> In a corresponding <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/new-report-exposes-ongoing-illegal-detention-sri-lanka-2012-03-13">press release</a> [official press release], AI suggests that "since October 2011, 32 people have been "abducted" or  subjected to abduction-style arrests that may qualify as enforced disappearances." 

<p>The report comes as the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">United Nations Human Rights Council</a> [official website] prepares to vote next week on a resolution backed by the United States which US attempts to hold Sri Lanka accountable for war crimes and demands Sri Lanka authorities <a href="http://blog.unwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/Sri-Lanka-draft-res.pdf">"present a comprehensive action plan" </a> [resolution text, PDF] which would detail steps they will take to end war crimes in the nation, including unlawful detentions. Sri Lanka conducted some independent investigations into allegations of war crimes occurring during the civil war. In December, Sri Lanka's Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission released a report concluding that Sri Lanka's military <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/sri-lanka-report-says-military-did-not-target-civilians.php">did not intentionally attack civilians</a> [JURIST report] following the country's civil war. In November, Sri Lankan Secretary of Defence Gotabaya Rajapaksa stated that the government had begun counting the number of civilian deaths from its 26-year civil war with the LTTE. Also in November, a Sri Lankan army chief was sentenced to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-former-army-chief-sentenced-to-three-more-years-for-implicating-war-crimes.php">three additional years of imprisonment</a> [JURIST report], for implicating another Sri Lankan official in war crimes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, presented his report in front of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website]. In the report, Quintana praised recent political reform efforts by the government of Myanmar but stressed that elections in April will be a more true test of how far political reforms have progressed:<blockquote>The upcoming by-elections on 1 April 2012 will be a key test of how far the Government has progressed in its reform process. There is, however, a risk of backtracking on the progress achieved to date. At this crucial moment in the country's history, remaining human rights concerns and challenges should be addressed, and justice and accountability measures, as well as measures to ensure access to the truth, should be taken.</blockquote>Additionally, Quintana made several policy recommendations in the report. He called on the Myanmar government to release all political prisoners, ensure that new political reforms are implemented and guarantee that citizens are afforded freedoms of speech and assembly.

<p>Myanmar's nominally civilian government has implemented numerous political reforms since winning the first elections held in 20 years in March 2011. Last month, in addition to releasing political prisoners, Myanmar <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thein Sein</a> [BBC backgrounder] signed a clemency order that <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/myanmar-reduces-prisoners-sentences-on-allegedly-humanitarian-grounds.php">shortened sentences</a> [JURIST report] for many prisoners on humanitarian grounds. In December, Sein gave his official approval to a bill allowing the country's citizens to <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/myanmar-president-approves-peaceful-protest-bill.php">conduct peaceful protests</a> [JURIST report], if the protests are approved in advance. The Myanmar government also announced in December that the political party of opposition leader <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=suu+kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> [JURIST news archive] would be <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/suu-kyis-party-granted-legal-status-for-myanmar-elections.php">allowed to register</a> for the next elections, a move that would allow Suu Kyi to run for parliament after being <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/myanmar-officials-release-suu-kyi.php">detained under house arrest</a> [JURIST reports] for nearly eight years. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ban-ki-moon-to-visit-myanmar-praises-ongoing-reforms.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] the country's strive toward democracy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The identity of the US sergeant accused of the shootings has not been released, but the sergeant is alleged to have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/13/world/asia/afghanistan-shooting/?hpt=hp_c1">gone on a shooting spree</a> [CNN report] in a village in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan, which resulted in the deaths of nine children, three women and four men. Following the shootings, the suspect <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9139758/US-soldier-accused-of-killing-16-Afghans-could-be-executed-says-Leon-Panetta.html">returned to his base</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] and turned himself in. According to Panetta, the suspect will be tried under the US <a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ucmj.htm">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> (UCMJ) [text], which does allow for the death penalty. Panetta also indicated that targeted killing of civilians could warrant the death penalty under the military's code. The Afghanistan <a href="http://www.parliament.af/">Parliament</a> [official website] on Monday demanded that the solider be put on trial before the Afghan public, while Afghan <a href="http://president.gov.af/ps">President Hamid Karzai</a> [official website, in Pashto] also denounced the attack. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] called the killing of innocent civilians unacceptable and indicated that anyone responsible for such attacks will be held accountable. The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] has also stressed that the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=67512">military will be responsible</a> [press release] for the prosecution of the solider. 

<p>US military courts have previously dealt with the prosecution of soldiers accused of killing civilians in Afghanistan. In November, a US military court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/us-army-soldier-convicted-of-murdering-afghanistan-civilians.php">convicted an army squad commander</a> [JURIST report] of three counts of premeditated murder for leading a "kill team" in Afghanistan that targeted unarmed civilians and collected body parts as war trophies. <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/calvin_gibbs/index.html">Sgt. Calvin Gibbs</a> [NYT profile], 26, was given a life sentence for 15 convictions including murder, assault and conspiracy connected to the killing of three men not long after he took over the Fifth Brigade of the <a href="http://www.usarmy.com/">US Army</a> [official website] Second Division in Afghanistan's Kandahar province in November 2009. Gibbs admitted to cutting and keeping fingers from the corpses as trophies, but claimed that he was merely returning enemy fire and was not motivated to kill. Prosecutors, however, relied on Gibbs' own likening of collecting amputated body parts to the antlers of a deer to characterize the platoon leader as a hunter who killed Afghans "for sport." While Gibbs was given a life sentence, the court also granted the possibility of parole after less than 10 years. </p>]]></content:encoded>

During the interactive dialogue in Geneva, an updated version of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session19/A-HRC-19-69_en.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] of the International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic was provided. According to the report, more than 500 children have been killed since March 2011. It alleged that snipers and other State forces were responsible for killing or wounding children including those were 10 years of age or younger. Pinheiro criticized the Syrian government in limiting access to humanitarian organizations and called for an "unimpeded humanitarian access" which would allow investigation to the situation in Syria. Until then, these organizations can only rely on documents and other sources the government provides which are not enough and cannot replace first-hand investigations. Pinheiro also pointed out that force used by the government against armed forces did not resolve the problem but rather heightened the level of violence and often affected civilians through collective punishment. Syria, on the other hand, rejected the validity of the report alleging that it was biased and contained baseless accusations. It also noted that the increased violence was due to external parties that armed different groups in Syria and encouraged them to go against each other. On Tuesday <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/portal/las_ar/home_page/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gXy8CgMJMgYwODEH8zA08jD5cgP0M_YwsvY6B8JB55QwK6gxOL9MNBduI3AyRvgAM4Guj7eeTnpuoX5EZUeOo6KgIA1RJ3BA!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/">Arab League</a> [official website, in Arabic] Secretary General <a href="http://www.arableagueonline.org/wps/portal/las_en/inner/!ut/p/c5/vZPLcoJAEEW_xQ9IzcDwcklEBAV5DQhsqEHJAD5AISJ8fbAqi2w0G8u-y1u3z110gxiMOpFrQUlbVCdyACGIhUSZOm7AuQhK3nwKdVbRLXPFstBCox899iXxn_QGhJBLvLKv9WE_uOXgLjE2ES7NzlTmPcbBqp3fjGbf3fBlba73VJ3llCyCy5kfqvOK6nJqq1pJJxPgZadxX_yMeO9z9-GDkSGIQCz-yfMqA3XHk5zPxYzVAxbgFzZ-ylKZN7LQ-1gBfClrCWJ6qNLxUjfGlopKo3eqHLot8bh0J7RCVtYwl0mPFg21vC9JtjTk7yLix5ou2iaeBr281TbsNSfcd95_2tvIp6FhCcn4AuH5gkqHJ87HGXfCrvbFzGityJgxt4TO2SJIGNsNrthOEx52YtHmCy5SfNjwjTN2W2vVMQP10b8WrsT8ClF5MvkBEmvpFA!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/?pcid=4ef73f00425e2a9fb9d3f9c0e4251219">Nabil al-Arabi</a> [official profile] called for an international inquiry into the situation in Syria after Syrian human rights groups reported that numerous civilians were killed in the towns of Homs and Idlib in western Syria.

<p>Syria has been subject to frequent criticism for human rights violations in the past few months. In February the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-accuses-syria-of-human-rights-violations.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] Syria of human rights violations after the commission of inquiry found that Syrian forces were engaging in torture and killing.

The judges sentenced Pedro Pimentel Rios, a former special forces solider whom the US extradited last July, to 30 years in prison for each of the 201 deaths, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j7b19kTSq5Iy8a-arhYb3gu6wnAg?docId=10535d0d6f3d40c0899f3ee13d2fcc12">plus 30 years for crimes against humanity</a> [AP report]. The sentence is primarily symbolic since, under Guatemalan law, a convict can serve a maximum of 50 years in prison. Before his extradition, Pimentel had been living in California <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17349774">working in a sweater factory</a> [BBC report]. Pimentel was one of about 20 Guatemalan soldiers that invaded a small Guatemalan village in 1982, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/13/us-guatemala-sentence-idUSBRE82C09R20120313">raping and killing men, women and children</a> [Reuters report]. The incident has become known as the Dos Erres massacre, named for the village in which it occurred. Pimentel is the fifth former soldier to be convicted in connection with the Dos Erres massacre.

<p>The Guatemalan civil war, which <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1215811.stm">lasted from 1960-1996</a> [BBC timeline] resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala's large indigenous Mayan population. According to a <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/spanish/toc.html">UN report</a> [text, in Spanish] released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. Earlier this month a Guatemalan judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/former-guatemala-dictator-denied-amnesty.php">denied amnesty</a> [JURIST report] to former dictator Effan Rios Montt, who was in power during the Dos Erres massacre. In February, JURIST guest columnist and Director of the Guatemala Human Rights Commission Kelsey Alford-Jones <a href="/hotline/2012/02/kelsey-alford-jones-montt.php">opined</a> [JURIST op-ed] that prosecuting Rios Montt was necessary to bring justice to his victims, as well as strengthen the Guatemalan judiciary. In August a Guatemalan court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/guatemala-court-sentences-ex-soldiers-to-6000-years.php">sentenced four former soldiers</a> [JURIST report] to over 6,000 years in prison on war crimes charges related to the Dos Erres massacre.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontunhumanrights.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Torture/SRTorture/Pages/SRTortureIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez</a> [official website] last week <a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2012/03/12/A_HRC_19_61_Add.4_EFSonly-2.pdf">formally accused</a> [text, PDF] the US government of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment towards <a href="http://www.bradleymanning.org/">Pfc. Bradly Manning</a> [advocacy website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=%22Bradley+Manning%22">news archive</a>], the US soldier held in solitary confinement for nearly a year based on his alleged involvement in <a href="http://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> [official website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=wikileaks">news archive</a>], the largest intelligence leak in US history. In assessing information that Manning was held in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day for about 11 months, Mendez stated that "solitary confinement is a harsh measure which may cause serious psychological and physiological adverse effects on individuals regardless of specific conclusions." Ultimately, Mendez <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/12/bradley-manning-cruel-inhuman-treatment-un?newsfeed=true">found</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that imposing such seriously punitive conditions of detention on a person who has not been found guilty of any crime is a violation of his right to physical and psychological integrity as well as his presumption of innocence. Depending on the conditions, he added, confinement may amount to a breach of the torture and degrading treatment prohibitions under Article 7 of the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm">International Convention on Civil and Political Rights</a> [text], and it may also qualify as "torture" under Article 1 of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> [text]. Although the US government has previously tried to justify Manning's confinement by calling it "prevention of harm watch," the military has not yet offered any details as to what actual harm was being prevented.

<p>The UN Special Rapporteur's formal allegations against the US government come after a 14-month investigation into the treatment of Manning since his arrest in May 2010. He was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-soldier-formally-charged-for-leaking-information-to-wikileaks.php">formally charged</a> [JURIST report] in February with 22 counts, including aiding the enemy, under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-37">Espionage Act</a> [text], and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. In May 2011, <a href="http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/">General Counsel for the US Department of Defense</a> [official website] wrote Mendez a <a href="http://spcomms.ohchr.org/Docs/01ComRepSep2011/Rep/2010_12coms/PR_USA_19.05.11_(20.2010).pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] in response to various UN inquiries explaining that Manning's treatment in confinement had been satisfactory and in accordance with "all other pretrial detainees." Prior to this, in January 2011, the <a href="http://geneva.usmission.gov/">US mission to the UN in Geneva</a> [official website] <a href="http://spcomms.ohchr.org/Docs/01ComRepSep2011/Rep/2010_12coms/PR_USA_27.01.11_(20.2010).pdf">wrote</a> [text, PDF] to Mendez stressing that the US would continue its commitment to protecting human rights both at home and abroad, and that the US values the work of the special rapporteur. The US, however, conceded that further coordination would need to be made before responding to Mendez's concerns involving Manning's treatment, which he made clear in his opening <a href="http://spcomms.ohchr.org/Docs/01ComRepSep2011/Com/2010_12/UA_USA_30.12.10_(20.2010).pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] to the US government in December 2010. Manning was <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/us-soldier-charged-for-releasing-classified-video-docs.php">initially charged</a> [JURIST report] in June 2010 for releasing a classified video and documents. Controversy surrounding his confinement drew quick and ongoing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/10/bradley-manning-legal-scholars-letter">criticism from US legal scholars</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], including Harvard law professor <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=74">Laurence Tribe</a> [official profile], the man who taught <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] constitutional law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A 2007 UN <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/sc7158.doc.htm">Security Council Resolution</a> [Resolution 1337 text] requires member states to freeze the assets, funds and economic resources of entities and their subsidiaries that are determined to be "engaged in, directly associated with or providing support for Iran's proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems." <a href="http://www.mellibank.co.uk/">Melli Bank</a> [corporate website], which is registered in the UK and regulated by the UK Financial Services Authority, was included on the list of entities subject to the freezing of assets by the EU, due to being a wholly owned subsidiary of BMI. The ECJ ruled that the lower court did not err in determining that EU law required the freezing of funds of any entity "owned or controlled" by an entity identified as engaged in nuclear proliferation. The ECJ concluded that Melli Bank did not itself have to be engaged in the nuclear proliferation, and it was enough that the parent-company BMI was engaged in such activity. The ECJ also concluded that freezing of Melli Bank's funds is an appropriate measure to be taken in order to attain the "legitimate objective of preserving international peace and security." According to the court:<blockquote>[W]here the funds of an entity identified as engaged in nuclear proliferation are frozen there is a not insignificant danger that that entity may exert pressure on the entities it owns or controls in order to circumvent the effect of the measures applying to it. In such circumstances, the freezing of the funds of entities owned or controlled by an entity engaged in nuclear proliferation is necessary and appropriate in order to ensure the effectiveness of the measures adopted against the latter and to ensure that those measures are not circumvented.</blockquote>The ECJ also upheld the lower court finding that no appropriate alternative measures existed to achieve the same objective. In addition to financial sanctions, the EU is scheduled to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-13/iran-s-bank-melli-loses-eu-court-challenge-to-unfreeze-funds.html">ban oil imports</a> [Bloomberg report] from Iran beginning on July 1. 

<p>The international community continues to urge Iran not to seek a nuclear weapons program. In February UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] called for Iran to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-calls-for-openness-in-irans-nuclear-program.php">prove its commitment</a> [JURIST report] to not seeking nuclear weapons after giving <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocus/sgspeeches/statments_full.asp?statID=1460">remarks</a> [text] at an event marking the fifteenth anniversary of the <a href="http://www.ctbto.org/fileadmin/content/treaty/treaty_text.pdf">Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty</a> (CTBT) [text, PDF]. Also in February the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/obama-signs-order-imposing-stricter-sanctions-on-iran.php">US began imposing strict sanctions on Iran</a> because of its nuclear program. Iran claims that <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-threatens-iaea-withdrawal-if.php">its nuclear rights are being taken away</a> [JURIST reports], but there are those who argue the <a href="http://www.iaea.org/">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [official website] has a <a href="/forum/2011/11/dan-joyner-iaea-report.php">legal right to regulate nuclear weapons</a> [JURIST op-ed]. There has also been a continued international response from the UN with <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-security-council-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iran.php">new sanctions being imposed in June 2010</a> to increase the restrictions placed on Iran from the <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/un-security-council-imposes-nuclear.php">first set of sanctions in 2006</a> [JURIST reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Pustay's request comes just over a year after the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/supreme-court-rules-against-government-in-freedom-of-information-case.php">ruled 8-1</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15843878805582897986&q=Milner+v.+Department+of+the+Navy&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39">Milner v. Department of the Navy</a> [opinion; Cornell LII <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/09-1163">backgrounder</a>] that the government may not withhold certain information under FOIA, and her request seeks to "protect the vital interests that have been left exposed by the Supreme Court's <span class="casename">Milner</span> opinion". The Court ruled that under USC &#167; 552(b)(2) (Exemption 2), which permits a government agency to keep secret only documents related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency, must be strictly construed to preclude the "High 2" expansion created by some circuits but rejected by others, which included information beyond personnel records such as infrastructure data and practices. In her remarks, Pustay said:<blockquote>For three decades, agencies had protected under "High 2" homeland-security and critical infrastructure information, law enforcement procedures, audit criteria, and other information that, if disclosed, would risk circumvention of the law.  Although it limited the scope of Exemption 2 to matters related solely to internal personnel rules and practices, the Supreme Court was sympathetic to the policy concerns raised by the government concerning the need to protect information when its disclosure risked harm. ... The Court acknowledged that it might be necessary for the Government to "seek relief from Congress."</blockquote>Pustay is the Director of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/index.html">Office of Information Policy</a> of the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official websites], the lead federal agency in the implementation of FOIA. Her remarks come during <a href="http://www.sunshineweek.org/">Sunshine Week</a> [official website], a national initiative sponsored by news organizations and advocacy groups that supports open government and freedom of information.

<p>Glen Scott Milner lived near Indian Island, a small island in the state of Washington that houses a naval magazine in which the Navy maintains non-nuclear explosives. In 2003 and 2004, Milner submitted two FOIA requests to the navy, seeking, among other things, explosive safety quantity distance (ESQD) information for the naval magazine. The Navy disclosed most of the documents that Milner requested but withheld the ESQD information on the grounds that it could threaten the naval magazine and surrounding community's safety and security. In its opinion in <span class="casename>Milner</span>, the court held that the plain meaning of the term "personnel rules and practices" in Exemption 2 encompassed only records relating to issues of employee relations and human resources, and that the explosives maps and data requested by Milner did not qualify for withholding under that exemption. This ruling exposed a large class of infrastructure and security data to possible disclosure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law is an amendment to China's Criminal Procedure Law and allows for the arrest and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=secret+detention">secret detention</a> [JURIST news archive] of those suspected of threatening the ruling <a href="http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/index.html">Communist Party of China</a> (CPC) [official website]. The law also includes a provision that requires officials to alert the relatives of a suspect who has been detained within 24 hours of such detention. The bill passed in the NPC with a vote of 2,639 delegates in favor of the legislation and <a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/afp/china-adopts-controversial-detention-law/504649">only 160 delegates opposing</a> [AFP report] the controversial measure. In a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/12/china-don-t-legalize-incommunicado-detentions">statement</a> [text] released prior to the NPC vote, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] urged China not pass the new law because it is "a clear danger for government critics and human rights activists, and ... [places China in] clear contravention of [its] international obligations."

<p>China's detention policies for those suspected of subversion have long been criticized, particularly in regard to the arrest and detention of political dissidents. In January Chinese authorities on <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/china-court-sentences-rights-activist-to-prison-for-subversion.php">sentenced prominent rights activist Li Tie</a> [JURIST report] to 10 years in prison for subversion, marking the third such sentence in a month. <a href="http://chrdnet.com/">Chinese Human Rights Defenders</a> [advocacy website] rejected the decision and said that such harsh sentences would do nothing to prevent or curb the social unrest. Another activist, <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-court-setences-dissident-to-10-years-in-prison.php">Chen Xi was sentenced to 10 years</a> [JURIST report] in late December 2011 for publishing political essays online. In that same month a court sentenced <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/china-court-sentences-dissident-to-nine-years-in-prison.php">Chen Wei to nine years in prison</a> [JURIST report]. In early January dissident Zhu Yufu was charged with subversion for writing and publishing a poem on the Internet that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16597830">urged people to act in support of freedom</a> [BBC report]. Two longer sentences for subversion convictions belong to Nobel Laureate <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11492131">Liu Xiaobo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Liu+XIaobo">news archive</a>], who has been <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/china-appeals-court-upholds-11-year.php">serving an 11-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] since 2009, and Liu Xianbin, who was jailed for 10 years in March 2011.<br />

The action comes following the <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/13/2692028/mexico-acts-to-toughen-law-against.html">deaths or disappearances of almost 50 journalists</a> [<em>Miami Herald</em> report] over the last five years. Most threats against journalists purportedly come from local and federal officers and law enforcement authorities. The Mexican government has taken heat in recent years from organizations such as the <a href="http://www.cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ) [advocacy website] for not protecting journalists. The organization released a <a href="http://www.cpj.org/reports/cpj_mexico_english.pdf">report</a> [PDF] in September 2010, which detailed the crimes against journalists and recommended ways to prevent future incidents, including the federalization of such crimes. In September 2011, <a href="http://en.rsf.org/">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) [advocacy website] released a statement condemning attacks on journalists in the country. They cite that <a href="http://en.rsf.org/mexico-woman-newspaper-editor-beheaded-in-26-09-2011,41057.html">almost 80 journalists were targeted in the last decade</a> [press release]. With the unanimous approval of the Senate the legislation now must pass 17 of 31 state legislatures for it to become law. 

<p>The passage of the law comes only days after the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/SRHRDefendersIndex.aspx">United Nations Special Rapporteur Margaret Sekaggya</a> [official website] outlined the risks and challenges faced by <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11905&LangID=E">human rights journalists and media workers</a> [press release], and <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/human-rights-defenders-journalists-need-protection-un-expert.php">called for additional protection</a> [JURIST report] of those workers. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] voiced concerns in October regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/un-urges-probe-into-mexico-journalist-deaths.php">growing number of journalists killed in Mexico</a> [JURIST report] and called for Mexican authorities to investigate these crimes and bring those responsible to justice. In May, RSF released its <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/middle-east-leaders-among-annual-list-of-threats-to-press-freedom.php">annual list of predators of press freedom</a> [JURIST report], which included the heads of state of several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as Mexican drug cartels. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The three-judge Trial Chamber I found that Prosecutor <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] established beyond a reasonable doubt that Lubanga, former president of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC), coordinated and actively supported the enlistment of child soldiers into his Patriotic Force for the Liberation of the Congo (FPLC) militia, the military wing of the UPC believed to have committed large-scale human rights abuses in Congo's violent Ituri district. Lubanga and his co-perpetrators designed to build an army for the purpose of establishing and maintaining political and military control over Ituri, a plan which resulted in boys and girls under the age of 15 being conscripted and used to participate actively in hostilities in 2002 and 2003. The court determined that Lubanga's contribution was essential to the common plan, that Lubanga personally used children below the age of 15 as his <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17364988">bodyguards, sex slaves and fighters</a> [BBC report] and that he regularly saw guards of other UPC/FPLC staff members who were below the age of 15. Lubanga requested a separate sentencing hearing under article 76(2) of the Rome Statute, and he is entitled to appeal his conviction within 30 days. He faces life imprisonment.

<p><a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/LubangaENG.pdf">The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo</a> [ICC information sheet] is a landmark case for the ICC. Not only is the trial verdict the first issued by the court since its inception 10 years ago, but Lubanga was the <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/congo-militia-leader-makes-first.php">first suspect taken into its custody</a> [JURIST report]. Furthermore, the case represents the first international trial focusing on the use of child soldiers. While other international criminal courts such as the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/ictr.php">news archive</a>] and <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website; JURIST <a href="/currentawareness/icty.php">news archive</a>] have limited territorial jurisdiction over a set period and will be wound up upon completion of their mandates, the ICC is a permanent body and its decision in the case could for the first time set international legal precedent for others accused of similar crimes. Lubanga was <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/icc-receives-first-war-crimes-suspect.php">taken into ICC custody</a> [JURIST report] in March 2006, becoming the first DRC war crimes defendant to appear before the ICC. Lubanga was <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/international-criminal-court-lays.php">charged</a> with enlisting child soldiers in his militia, and his trial began in January 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/icc-reluctantly-stays-trial-of-congo-ex.php">after being delayed for evidentiary reasons</a> and was then halted soon afterward when one of the child witnesses <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/lubanga-war-crimes-trial-resumes-after.php">recanted his testimony</a> [JURIST reports] that Lubanga had recruited him for the militia. The prosecution <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/prosecution-concludes-case-in-trial-of.php">concluded its case</a> [JURIST report] in July 2009 after presenting 22 weeks of testimony. Lubanga has <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/congo-ex-militia-leader-lubanga-pleads.php">maintained his innocence</a> [JURIST report] regarding the charges against him.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Secretary-General's call for the <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] to investigate comes just days after the International Commission of Inquiry on Libya released its <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/03/09/141334/un-report-international-commission.html">report</a> [text] on war crimes and crimes against humanity in Libya. The report alleged that abuses were committed by both sides during the conflict&#8212;supporters of Gaddafi and opponents of his regime alike. The report also concluded that <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) [official website] forces did not deliberately bomb civilians during the uprising in Libya. 

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/libya-leaders-abusing-torturing-gaddafi-supporters-ai.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] accused the ruling NTC of allowing the abuse and torture of supporters of the former leader by unofficial militias. In January the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-human-rights-chief-addresses-alleged-torture-of-libyan-detainees.php">addressed </a>[JURIST report] the <a href="http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] expressing concern over alleged current human rights violations in Libya. Earlier that month <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/middle-east-rights-groups-allege-human-rights-violations-in-libya.php">Middle East rights groups alleged human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] and that all parties involved, including NATO, committed acts ranging from use of excessive force against protesters to cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners during detention. In October of last year AI alleged that Libyan forces arrested nearly 2,500 people who face <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-officials-urged-to-stop-prisoner-abuse.php">ongoing torture and detainment</a> [JURIST report] without formal charges. In September the NTC vowed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses after <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">AI published a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the Libya conflict are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate these allegations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The colonel, Sebastiao Curio Rodrigues de Moura ("Curio") was considered to be a ruthless major who oversaw the Amazon section of the country after the military dictatorship came to power. He is being charged with the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/14/us-brazil-dictatorship-charges-idUSBRE82D08H20120314">torture and killing of five guerrillas</a> [Reuters report]. Many members of the military involved in the dictatorship have not been prosecuted due to an <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat.nsf/6fa4d35e5e3025394125673e00508143/732f5619b4eb3346c1257044005c5ee8/$FILE/Amnesty%20decree.Brazil.PORT.pdf">Amnesty Law</a> [text, PDF, in Portuguese] that was enacted before democracy was restored to the country. While the law has not been repealed, <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/">Inter-American Court of Human Rights</a> (IACHR) [official website] ruled in November 2010 that this amnesty law <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/brazil-urged-to-revoke-amnesty-law.php">should not prevent the investigation and prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of human rights violations that occurred during the dictatorship. In December 2010 the IACHR ruled the law was invalid because it was incompatible with the <a href="http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/treaties/b-32.html">American Convention on Human Rights</a> [text]. <a href="http://www.hrw.org/home">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] commended the prosecutors' move calling it a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/13/brazil-human-rights-prosecution-landmark-step">"landmark step for accountability"</a> [press release]. The charges are expected to be filed later this week. JURIST Guest Columnist Caio Abramo also believes that the country has a <a href="http://jurist.org/dateline/2012/02/caio-abramo-brazil-dictatorship.php">duty to prosecute</a> [JURIST op-ed] perpetrators of the crimes. 

<p>Brazilian <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11446466">President Dilma Rousseff</a> [BBC profile] in November <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/brazil-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-human-rights-abuses.php">signed a law</a> [JURIST report] establishing a truth commission to investigate human rights abuses perpetrated by the military from 1946 to 1988.

Other Latin American countries have recently taken steps to end amnesties for their military dictatorships. In March, AI <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/rights-group-urges-el-salvador-to.php">urged government officials in El Salvador</a> [JURIST report] to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/el-salvador-urged-repeal-amnesty-law-2010-03-23">repeal</a> [press release] a 1993 amnesty law that <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/el-salvador-defends-amnesty-laws.php">prevents any investigation</a> [JURIST report] into killings committed during the country's <a href="http://www.pbs.org/itvs/enemiesofwar/elsalvador2.html">12-year civil war</a> [PBS backgrounder], including the killing of respected Catholic Archbishop <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4376733.stm">Oscar Romero</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=oscar+romero">news archive</a>].

The report, entitled, "'I wanted to die' Syria's torture survivors speak out," catalogs testimony from Syrian civilians who have allegedly survived torture, detention or other harsh treatment at the hands of Syrian authorities. In addition to chronicling claims of widespread torture perpetrated by Syrian authorities, AI makes policy recommendations for both the Syrian government and the international community. The report calls on Syria to end the systematic use of torture and to stop arbitrarily arresting and isolating people who peacefully protest against the government. The report also urges governments around the world to investigate and prosecute alleged crimes against humanity that Syrian authorities have committed.<blockquote>According to the many testimonies gathered and received by Amnesty International over the past year, people are almost invariably beaten and otherwise tortured and ill-treated during arrest, often during the subsequent transportation to detention centres, and routinely upon arrival at the detention centres and afterwards. Among the victims are children aged under 18. The torture and other ill-treatment appear intended to punish, to intimidate, to coerce "confessions" and perhaps to send a warning to others as to what they may expect should they also be arrested. In almost all cases the detainees are held in incommunicado detention, often for lengthy periods, with no access to visits from their families or lawyers in conditions which all too often amount to enforced disappearance.</blockquote>AI concludes from the aggregate of individual testimonies that Syrian officials' torture and ill treatment of detained citizens is purposeful and systematic.

<p>Human rights groups have harshly criticized the Syrian government since crackdowns against protesters began last year. On Tuesday a UN expert on Syria declared that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/syria-rights-situation-worsening-un-expert.php">human rights situation in Syria is worsening</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in March the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-human-rights-council-denounces-syria-crackdown.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing Syrian officials' crackdown on human rights. The resolution came on the heels of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-immediate-cease-fire-in-syria.php">demand for a cease-fire</a> [JURIST report] by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] in late February. Earlier in February, the UN-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria accused the government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-accuses-syria-of-human-rights-violations.php">violating international human rights law</a> [JURIST report] after finding that Syrian forces are engaging in torture and killings under orders from high level government officials. Also in February, Pillay and <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">called for an end to the violence</a> in Syria, with Pillay asking the UN Security Council to <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST reports] to the International Criminal Court (ICC).</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Supreme Court unanimously <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17360739">affirmed</a> [BBC report] the lower court's ruling which allowed a 15-year-old girl to obtain an abortion after she was sexually assaulted by her stepfather. In its decision, the court adopted a broad interpretation of  Section II, Article 86 of the <a href="http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/15000-19999/16546/texact.htm">Argentine Penal Code</a> [text, in Spanish], which outlaws abortion except to save the life of the mother or where "the pregnancy [results] from a rape or indecent assault committed on a female idiot or insane." In the past, courts have interpreted the provision to require that the rape victim suffer from a mental disability in order to qualify for the Article 86 exception. The court determined, however, that a proper reading of the entire article supports the interpretations that all rape victims may legally seek abortions. The decision stated that future rape victims would not be required to seek judicial approval in order to obtain the procedure. The case, however, caused backlash among the Argentinian population due to the amount of time it took for the court to render a verdict. 

<p>Recently, activists have called for the reformation of laws involving reproductive rights in Argentina. In 2010 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] published a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2010/08/10/illusions-care">report</a> [text; <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2010/08/10/argentina-guarantee-women-s-access-health-care">press release</a>] on the state of reproductive rights in Argentina. The report criticized, among other things, the lack of access to safe abortions, indicating that over 20 percent of obstetric deaths are attributable to unsafe abortions, making them the leading cause of maternal mortality in the country. Abortion is a controversial issue in Latin America. Abortion remains controversial in predominately Catholic Latin America. Last year the Supreme Court of Mexico <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/mexico-high-court-allows-state-anti-abortion-amendment.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a state right-to-life constitutional amendment that says life begins at conception. The amendment effectively bans abortions in Mexico's northern Baja California state. In 2008 Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/dnp-uruguay.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would have partially decriminalized abortion in the country. In countries such as <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/colombia-high-court-legalizes.php">Colombia</a> [JURIST report] and <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/photos/2005/argentina0605/html/argentina.htm">Argentina</a> [HRW report], criminal penalties may be decreased when the mother's life is at risk. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Marvin Aspen issued an <a href="http://www.personalpac.org/-/pdf/personal-pac-lawsuit-2.pdf">injunction</a> [order, PDF] against the <a href="http://www.elections.il.gov/Default.aspx">Illinois State Board of Elections</a> (ISBE) [official website] from enforcing &#167; 5/9-8.5(d) prohibiting any political action committee (PAC) from accepting individual contributions over $10,000 and &#167; 5/9-2(d) prohibiting any person from maintaining or establishing more than one PAC. The non-profit, pro-choice organization <a href="http://www.personalpac.org/">Personal PAC</a> [advocacy website] brought the <a href="http://www.personalpac.org/-/pdf/personal-pac-lawsuit.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the ISBE last month, seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction against the two provisions so the abortion rights group could create an independent-expenditure PAC and take unlimited contributions. The court agreed that together the election code sections violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt1afrag1_user.html">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] under the US Supreme Court's decision in <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-205">Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/supreme-court-eases-restrictions-on.php">report</a>], finding that government interest in preventing corruption cannot justify restriction on independent expenditures, and the Seventh Circuit's ruling in <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/11-2623/11-2623-2011-12-12-opinion-2011-12-12.pdf?1323718564">Wisconsin Right to Life v. Barland</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-wisconsin-campaign-finance-law.php">report</a>], finding no valid government interest sufficient to impose restrictions on contributions to independent-expenditure-only PACs such as Personal PAC. In his opinion Aspen stressed his ruling is a narrow one, applicable only to restrictions on independent expenditures&#8212;money used to advocate for or against a specific candidate without coordination with any public official, candidate, or political party&#8212;and that the lawsuit did not contest restrictions on contributions made directly to political candidates.

<p>Illinois campaign contribution restrictions were passed in 2009 as part of election reform efforts following the indictment of former governor <a href="http://www.thepublicityagency.com/rod-blagojevich/index.htm">Rod Blagojevich</a> [personal website; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=blagojevich">news archive</a>], who was <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 on corruption charges including allegations that he conspired to sell the Senate seat left vacant by US President Barack Obama. Blagojevich was convicted in June on 18 counts of corruption. He was previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">found guilty of making false statements to the FBI</a> [JURIST report], but the jury in that trial remained deadlocked on the 23 other charges. The prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dropped some of the charges</a> [JURIST report] to simplify the case for retrial, including some for racketeering. The Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office in January 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bill was passed earlier Wednesday in the <a href = "http://www.house.state.pa.us/index.cfm">House of Representatives</a> [official website] by a vote of 104-88. Supporters of the proposed legislation say that it will combat voter fraud, but opponents fear that it will disenfranchise poor, elderly and minority voters who may find it difficult to obtain a photo ID. Unlike the current trend of voter ID laws, however, Pennsylvania's allows voters to vote without an ID as long as they verify their identity within six days of voting. Absentee ballots will also only require identification by Social Security number. On the passage of the bill, Corbett said, "I am signing this bill because it protects a sacred principle, one shared by every citizen of this nation. That principle is: one person, one vote. It sets a simple and clear standard to protect the integrity of our elections." The <a href = "http://www.aclupa.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania</a> [advocacy website] is <a href = "http://www.aclupa.org/issues/votingissues/voterid.htm">preparing a legal challenge</a> [press release].

<p>There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/?tabid=16602">32 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, but the issue remains controversial. Earlier this week a Wisconsin judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-voter-id-law-ruled-unconstitutional.php">permanently enjoined</a> [JURIST report] that state's voter ID law. Last month the Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-passes-voter-identification-bill.php">approved a voter ID law</a> [JURIST report]. Also in February South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/south-carolina-sues-federal-government-over-blocked-voter-id-law.php">filed suit</a> against the US Department of Justice (DOJ) over its ruling that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/DOJ-rejects-new-South-Carolina-voter-ID-law.php">barred South Carolina</a> [JURIST reports] from enforcing its voter ID law. In November Mississippi voters <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/mississippi-passes-voter-id-requirement.php">approved a ballot measure</a> [JURIST report] to implement a voter ID law. In June Missouri <a href="http://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/missouri-governor-vetoes-voter-ID-legislation.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring persons to present photo ID at voting booth. Last March the <a href="http://www.gasupreme.us/index.php">Georgia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring voters to present one of six government-issued photo IDs in order to vote. In contrast, a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/ninth-circuit-strikes-down-arizona-voter-registration-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a portion of Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration in October 2010.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The suit, filed in the <a href = "http://www.mad.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Massachusetts</a> [official website] on behalf of the Ugandan rights group <a href = "http://www.smug.4t.com/">Sexual Minorities Uganda</a> (SMUG) [advocacy website], is the first to allege lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) harassment as a violation of the <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Statute</a> [text], which allows survivors of human rights abuses to file suit against American citizens who perpetrated them in violation of US treaties. CCR and SMUG charge that Lively aided in drafting and publicizing the <a href = "http://nationalpress.typepad.com/files/bill-no-18-anti-homosexuality-bill-2009.pdf">Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill</a> [text, PDF], colloquially known as the "kill the gays bill," which aims to sentence open homosexuals to life in prison or the death penalty. The complaint alleges that generally, Lively's goals have been to perpetuate abuse against the LGBTI community:<blockquote>In large part due to defendant Lively's contributions to the conspiracy to persecute LGBTI persons in Uganda, plaintiff SMUG, as an entity, as well as its individual staff-members and member organizations, have suffered severe deptivations of fundamental rights. Their very existence has been demonized through a coordinated campaign, which Lively has largely initiated, instigated and directed, to attribute to the "genocidal" "gay movement" an irrepressible predilection to commit rape and child sexual abuse. ... [T]hey have endured severe discrimination in virtually every meaningful aspect of their civil and political lives; their association has been criminalized; their advocacy on issues central to their health and political participating has been suppressed and punished; and they have been subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. As a result, many individual members of SMUG and its constituent organizations live in persistent fear of harassment, arbitrary arrest and physical harm, including death.</blockquote>The complaint also alleges collusion with Ugandan Minister of Ethics and Integrity James Buturo and Member of Parliament David Bahati. After the suit was announced, <a href = "http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/03/protest_march_supports_lawsuit_against_springfield_minister_scott_lively.html">protests began</a> [MassLive report] both supporting and against Lively. Lively stated he will <a href = "http://www.defendthefamily.com/pfrc/newsarchives.php?filter=&index=0&displaycount=15&topic=0&inhouse=0&search=&displaymode=detail">defend against the suit</a> [press release].

<p>Uganda's growing anti-LGBTI actions have been internationally scrutinized since the murder of prominent gay rights activist <a href = "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12299786">David Kato</a> [BBC report] last January. Kato was the advocacy officer of SMUG. In November, the Ugandan High Court sentenced a man to <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/uganda-man-sentenced-to-30-years-for-killing-gay-rights-activist.php">30 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for Kato's murder. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a statement last month <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/Uganda-must-end-antigay-human-rights-violations-AI.php">condemning the recent anti-gay actions</a> [JURIST report] by the government. Minister for Ethics and Integrity Simon Lokodo shut down an LGBT workshop that month by advocacy group Freedom and Roam, declaring it illegal and trying to arrest the leader. That incident occurred shortly after the <a href = "http://www.parliament.go.ug/">Parliament of Uganda</a> [official website] brought back the aforementioned <a href = "/paperchase/2012/02/uganda-reintroduces-legislation-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">anti-gay bill</a> [JURIST report]. In February 2010, US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/obama-congress-denounce-uganda-anti-gay.php">publicly denounced the proposed legislation</a> and the month before, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/un-rights-chief-criticizes-proposed.php">warned that it could harm Uganda's reputation</a> [JURIST reports] internationally. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a HREF="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/03/14/11-35661.pdf">rejected</a> [opinion text, PDF] a law suit on Wednesday brought by conservation groups trying to preserve federal endangered species protections for wolves. The groups were trying to preserve the protected status of the Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf following an amendment to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.epa.gov/lawsregs/laws/esa.html">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA) [materials] which removed the wolf from the list. The plaintiffs claimed that the amendment was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers doctrine. This ruling gives approval to wolf hunts currently underway in <a href="http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/hunt/?getPage=121">Idaho</a> and <a href="http://fwp.mt.gov/hunting/planahunt/huntingGuides/wolf/default.html">Montana</a> [materials]. Following the ruling, wolf expert Michael Robinson from the <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2012/wolves-03-14-2012.html">condemned the ruling</a> [press release]: <blockquote>Congress set a terrible precedent by passing this backdoor rider that took away protection from wolves. Scientists, not politicians, need to decide which species need protection. That&#8217;s the law. And that&#8217;s what makes sense if we&#8217;re going to save animals and plants from extinction. We will continue to fight the good fight on behalf of wolves across the country. These incredible animals deserve a shot at recovery beyond just the few pockets where they eke out a living today.</blockquote>Jay Tutchton, a lawyer for one of the conservation groups involved in the lawsuit, <a href="http://www.wildearthguardians.org/site/PageServer">WildEarth Guardians</a> [advocacy website], indicated that the plaintiffs may still chose to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, though they are more likely to campaign to Congress to get the wolves re-listed.

<p>Three environmental groups <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/environmental-groups-file-emergency-injunction-to-halt-wolf-hunts.php">filed an emergency motion</a> [JURIST report] with the Ninth Circuit court in August requesting that the court halt the wolf hunt. However, the US <a href= "http://www.fws.gov/">Fish and Wildlife Services</a> [official website] gave control of the wolf population only to state governments in Montana and Idaho, restricting the wolves in Wyoming under Federal guidelines. Days earlier, a judge for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Montana</a> [official website] <a target="_blank" href="http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/missoulian.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/e5/4e5a103c-be2e-11e0-80fc-001cc4c03286/4e39e3b35598e.pdf.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that Congress' removal of the gray wolf from the ESA, not through amending it but through attaching a "wolf rider" to an appropriations bill, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/montana-judge-allows-congress-to-remove-wolves-from-endangered-species-list.php">was legal</a> [JURIST report]. In August 2010, Judge Malloy ruled that it was improper to remove restrictions in one jurisdiction and not another, and put the wolves back on the ESA entirely.

The legislation calls for the expansion of the telecommunications infrastructure in Uganda, as well as an increase in the presence of military forces in the region. House members <a href="http://mcgovern.house.gov/">Jim McGovern</a> (D) and <a href="http://royce.house.gov/">Ed Royce</a> (R) [official websites] introduced the bipartisan legislation after the Kony 2012 campaign initiative, a viral video by <a href="http://www.invisiblechildren.com/">Invisible Children</a> [advocacy website] that calls for an international effort to arrest Kony, sparked international interest in Kony's apprehension. Last year, McGovern and Royce introduced the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:h2478:">Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act</a> [text] which made it the official policy of the US to stop Kony and his commanders. That legislation was signed into law last year and resulted in the deployment of a small group of military advisers to the region to assist in finding Kony. 

<p>The Kony 2012 campaign has renewed interest in the search for the alleged Ugandan war criminal. Last week, <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court </a>(ICC) [official website] chief prosecutor <a href="http://icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/Structure+of+the+Court/Office+of+the+Prosecutor/Biographies/The+Prosecutor.htm">Luis Moreno-Ocampo</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/kony-2012-icc-supports-while-ai-cautions.php">expressed his support</a> [JURIST report] for the campaign by Invisible Children to capture Kony. The ICC <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc97185.PDF">issued an arrest warrant</a> [text, PDF] against Kony in 2005 on 33 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, sexual enslavement, rape and abduction. In 2009, ICC stated that it is still <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/icc-still-seeking-arrest-of-uganda-war.php">seeking to arrest Kony</a> [JURIST report]. He has <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/uganda-rebel-leader-wanted-by-icc.php">denied the allegations</a> [JURIST report] against him. Despite ICC's <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/icc-calls-for-cooperation-in-arresting.php">calling for global cooperation</a> [JURIST report] after issuing the warrant to arrest Kony, he has remained at large.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The verdict comes in a case brought by the parents of two female students who were shot by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6564653.stm">Seung-Hui Cho</a> [BBC profile] in the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=virginia+tech">2007 massacre</a> [JURIST news archive]. The parents alleged that their daughters' <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/15/tagblogsfindlawcom2012-decided-idUS241785121820120315">lives could have been spared</a> [Reuters report] had the University Police not jumped to conclusions about Cho's motivations after the bodies of his first victims were found. The police believed those shootings were the result of a jealous boyfriend and failed to notify students of a gunman on the loose. When they finally did, it was too late and Cho had begun the second phase of his killing-spree that left 32 victims and the gunman dead. The state of Virginia, as well as Virginia Tech officials, have always claimed that they did everything they could, and, based upon the evidence, it was reasonable to conclude that the first incident was isolated. The <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gV3g4sFWi6QAMUR5yRzEkODjKBJw?docId=b21c7c30a9f249c79443a76cf89e907e">jury did not agree</a> [AP report] with that defense and awarded the families of Julia Pryde and Erin Peterson $4 million each. That number is expected to drop, because the state of Virginia has a law that caps such awards at $100,000. The lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/judge-denies-immunity-claim-in-virginia-tech-wrongful-death-lawsuit.php">initially held up</a> [JURIST report] as the defense asserted an immunity claim that was overruled in November 2010. In 2009 the families of all of the victims were awarded an $11 million settlement, but the Pryde and Peterson families <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/families-of-virginia-tech-shooting.php">chose to opt out</a> [JURIST report] and pursue their wrongful death action. The state is expected to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/jury-in-wrongful-death-trial-virginia-tech-negligent-for-delayed-response-to-07-shootings/2012/03/14/gIQAIes6CS_story.html">appeal</a> [AP report] the decision in the next few days. 

<p>Virginia Tech has faced several lawsuits over the shooting incident. In June 2008 24 of the 32 victims' families agreed to the <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/judge-approves-11-million-virginia-tech.php">$11 million dollar settlement</a> [JURIST report]. The settlement gave each family $100,000 plus medical expenses and provided for meetings with Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and Virginia Tech administration and police officials. Many of the families had considered wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits against the state of Virginia after an independent state panel reported that different school policies could have avoided some of the deaths, but the settlement terms required the families to release their claims. In December 2007 Congress <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/congress-passes-bill-closing-gun.php">passed by voice vote</a> an act that closes a <a href="/paperchase/2007/04/virgina-tech-gunman-prohibited-by.php">loophole</a> [JURIST reports] that allowed Cho to purchase firearms despite a court order mandating psychiatric treatment. The Virginia Tech shootings left 33 people dead and 25 wounded in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/vatechshootings/?sid=ST2008061701801">deadliest shooting incident in US history</a> [WP backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

In his closing remarks, Seselj said the UN-created ICTY does not have jurisdiction over him, and that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/serbian-war-crimes-suspect-seselj-says-his-trial-was-political/2012/03/14/gIQA2asCCS_story.html">his trial was political</a> [AP report]. Seselj is <a href="http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ses-remdamdi070329.pdf">charged</a> [indictment, PDF] with three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes and is accused of establishing rogue paramilitary units affiliated with the ultranationalist <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6296601.stm">Serbian Radical Party</a> (SRS) [BBC backgrounder], which are believed to have massacred and otherwise persecuted Croats and other non-Serbs during the Balkan conflict.

No date has been set for the verdict. 

<p>In January the ICTY announced that Seselj is suing them for USD $2.6 million in damages due to alleged <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/icty-war-crimes-suspect-demands-compensation-for-trial-delays.php">unreasonable delays</a> [JURIST report] in his trial. His war crimes <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/serb-nationalist-leader-on-trial-at.php">trial began</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 after he was charged with crimes against humanity and  war crimes. His trial was briefly <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/icty-delays-seselj-trial-over-witness.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 because of concerns witnesses were being intimidated. The trial resumed in 2010 after the delay, and was again ordered to continue in 2011 after Seselj sought to have the <a href="http://www.icty.org/x/cases/seselj/cis/en/cis_seselj_en.pdf">charges dismissed</a> [case sheet, PDF].

In a statement, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Defenders/MARGARETSEKAGGYA_CV.pdf">UN special rapporteur Margaret Sekaggya</a> [CV, PDF], along with rapporteurs <a href="http://www.srhrdafrica.org/mrs-reine-alapini-gansou-0">Reine Alapini-Gansou</a> [official profile] and <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/defenders/mandate/composition.asp">Jose de Jesus Orozco Henriquez</a> [official profile], <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11957&LangID=E">claimed</a> [press release] that such government reprisals occur in various forms, and that enhanced monitoring of these situations can help safeguard the collaboration between civil society and international human rights mechanisms that is necessary to respect UN, ACHRP, and IACHR rules that prohibit reprisals by States and non-State actors. Read the statement:<blockquote>These reprisals against individuals and/or groups engaging directly with the UN, the ACHPR and the IACHR, or otherwise providing information on particular countries human rights situations, take the form of smear campaigns, harassment, intimidation, direct threats, physical attacks and killings.

<p>Such steps towards full accountability for reprisals are an important preventive measure that should be combined with those that facilitate, rather than deter, civil society's safe and unimpeded access to the UN and the regional human rights institutions.</blockquote>The rapporteurs also expressed their support for the recent initiative by <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/HRCPresident6thcycle.htm">President Laura Dupuy Lasserre</a> [official profile], who called on governments to put an end to harassment and intimidation of individuals and groups attending the ongoing session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

<p>Sekkagya <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11534&LangID=E">reported</a> [press release] in October that <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/human-rights-defenders-still-threatened-un-expert.php">human rights defenders are still being harassed</a> [JURIST report], attacked and killed despite the international declaration adopted for their protection more than a decade ago. In her fourth <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G11/175/06/PDF/G1117506.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] on the right to defend human rights, issued in December 2011, the UN rapporteur stressed that implementing the 1998 <a href="http://olddoc.ishr.ch/hrdo/documents/DeclarationHRD.pdf">UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders</a> [text, PDF] is essential to allowing the defenders to carry out their work, and that failing to implement these international standards creates an undermined, ineffective process.

The "Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act" is based off of Arizona's <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf">SB 1070</a> [text, PDF], which has been the subject of national debate and <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">federal litigation</a> [JURIST news archive]. As originally introduced, the Mississippi legislation would have required public schools to check the status of enrolling students and allowed for police officers to check the status of individuals pulled over in traffic. The version that was approved excludes those provisions but does require police to check the immigration status of anyone arrested and prohibits illegal aliens from entering into business transactions. The bill will now be sent to the Senate for approval, where it is expected to pass. Governor Phil Bryant has already expressed his support for the measure.

<p>The Mississippi law comes on the heels of other controversial immigration reforms proposed in many states following the Arizona law. Similar legislation has passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-legislature-approves-new-version-of-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports]. Last week the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eleventh-circuit-defers-ruling-on-alabama-georgia-immigration-laws.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] to challenge immigration legislation recently passed in Alabama and Georgia, but the court postponed its ruling until after the Supreme Court decides on the Arizona law. In December the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether Arizona's controversial immigration law is <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">preempted by federal law</a> [JURIST report]. In November the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-urges-supreme-court-not-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-appeal.php">urged the Supreme Court not to hear</a> [JURIST report] Arizona's appeal. In what many view as an indication of how the Supreme Court may rule, the court ruled in May in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that Arizona's controversial employment-related immigration law is <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">not preempted by the Immigration Reform and Control Act</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The report states that the Sinhala majority is encroaching on Tamil land, and the government maintains an excessive military presence in the province. A 25-year civil war between Sri Lanka and the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=tamil+tigers">Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</a> (LTTE) [JURIST news archive], a rebel group fighting for an independent Tamil state, ended in 2009. The report expresses concern the Sri Lankan government's current practices may threaten the possibility of long-term peace and risk inciting violence:<blockquote>Deepening militarisation of the province presents a threat to long-term peace and stability. Far in excess of any legitimate need to protect against an LTTE revival, the militarisation of the north is generating widespread fear and anger among Tamils: indeed, the strategy being executed runs the risk of inadvertently resurrecting what it seeks to crush once and for all - the possibility of violent Tamil insurrection. The construction of large and permanent military cantonments, the growing involvement of the military in agricultural and commercial activities, the seizure of large amounts of private and state land, and the army's role in determining reconstruction priorities are all serious concerns.</blockquote>The report concludes that the Tamil population is currently "exhausted" by war, but, if the Sri Lankan government does not begin to include the Tamil population in governance and respect their needs, there may be violence in the future.

<p>Controversy has surrounded both the actions of the Sri Lankan government towards the Tamil population and the LTTE during the civil. Earlier this week <a href="http://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] released a report <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/rights-group-details-claim-of-sri-lanka-detention-abuses.php">detailing the use of unlawful detentions</a> [JURIST report] by the Sri Lankan government. The report also states that the LTTE commonly used abductions and torture during the civil war as well. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] is set to vote next week on a resolution backed by the US to hold Sri Lanka accountable for war crimes and demand Sri Lankan authorities <a href="http://blog.unwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/Sri-Lanka-draft-res.pdf">"present a comprehensive action plan"</a> [resolution text, PDF] which would detail steps they will take to end war crimes in the nation, including unlawful detentions. Last month thousands of Sri Lankans <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/thousands-in-sri-lanka-protest-proposed-un-war-crimes-resolution.php">gathered to protest</a> [JURIST report] the proposed resolution. In December Sri Lanka's <a href="http://www.llrc.lk/">Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission</a> [official website] released a report announcing that the <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/sri-lanka-report-says-military-did-not-target-civilians.php">Sri Lanka military did not target civilians</a> [JURIST report]. In November a former Sri Lankan army chief was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-former-army-chief-sentenced-to-three-more-years-for-implicating-war-crimes.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to an additional three years in prison for his comment to a local newspaper that the Sri Lankan government ordered the killing of surrendering rebel leaders during the civil war. In April a UN report <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">accused both the Sri Lankan government and rebels of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] during the final stages of the country's civil war with the LTTE.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge George Daniels found <a href="http://www.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-arabia-remain-out-of-9-11-damages-case-450167.html">no sufficient basis to grant the plaintiffs' motion</a> [Reuters report], noting that such a motion was already presented to SDNY and rejected in 2005 by Judge Richard Conway Casey, who <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">dismissed Saudi Arabia as a defendant</a> [JURIST report] at that time. For grounds to reopen the case, the plaintiffs cited a November <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/eb476ec6-877e-4ffd-801e-2a072b931916/3/doc/09-4958-cv_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/eb476ec6-877e-4ffd-801e-2a072b931916/3/hilite/">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] of the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] that allowed a similar claim to proceed against Afghanistan, but Daniels stated that decision does not allow the claim against Saudi Arabia to be reinstated because the <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-dismisses-911-lawsuit.php">case was closed years ago</a> [JURIST report] and the recent Second Circuit decision has no bearing. The plaintiffs nevertheless plan to appeal the dismissal. Lawyers for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia noted the claim has already lost on appeal of the 2005 rejection, and the US Supreme Court at that time reviewed but declined to hear the case. The plaintiffs originally sued over 200 entities and governments&#8211;about 100 are still listed as defendants, and active litigation concerns less than 10.

<p>The claim against Saudi Arabia was <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/second-circuit-dismisses-911-lawsuit.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] in 2008 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit because there was insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes had actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the 9/11 attacks. Even after 10 years, cases brought by victims of the 9/11 terrorist attack against other governmental entities did not come to an end. In December, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/index_2011_12_25.php#39790">denied the allegations</a> [JURIST report] that it was actively involved in the terrorist attack after a <a href="http://information.iran911case.com/Havlish_Order_of_Judgment_Signed_12_22_11.pdf">default judgment</a> [text, PDF; <a href="http://information.iran911case.com/Havlish_Findings_of_Fact_and_Conclusions_of_Law_Signed_12-22-11.pdf">findings of facts and conclusions</a>, PDF] in <a href="http://www.iran911case.com/">Havlish v. Bin Laden</a> [case materials]. In June Judge Daniels <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/new-york-district-judge-dismisses-cases-against.php">dismissed 49 other terrorism lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] based on lack of evidence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Working Group, a panel of five independent human rights experts, found a "chronic pattern of impunity demonstrated by the absence of effective investigations in cases of enforced disappearances." In their <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G11/174/92/PDF/G1117492.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] on the situation of enforced detention in Mexico, the Working Group examined the legal and institutional framework of criminal justice in Mexico and discussed the current security situation and citizen's rights to truth and justice. The Working Group also explored the realities "faced by particularly vulnerable groups, such as migrants, women, human rights defenders and journalists." The report outlined 33 recommendations for areas of improvement including a call for more investigations, stronger sanctions, reparations for victims and increased attention for the protection of vulnerable groups. The Working Group warned that the issue should be addressed because the "victims of enforced disappearances do not trust the justice system or the Public Ministries." The report was not completely negative. The Working Group did express appreciation for the openness of the Mexican government and recent human rights positive constitutional changes made by the same. Additionally, the Working Group acknowledged "the challenges posed by the current complex public security situation in the context of the fight against organized crime."

Instead, the legacy of the Papuan Congress crackdown will be five unjust convictions, while those responsible for the violence go unpunished.</blockquote>The five convicted men <a href="http://tapol.gn.apc.org/statements/Treasontrialstatement120109.pdf">released a letter</a> [text, PDF] when the trial began, rejecting the law under which they were being charged and reaffirming their right to free expression. They each received five-year prison sentences for their actions at the October protest, at which at least three people were killed and more than 90 injured. Eight police officers involved with the shooting of the protesters were let off with a warning.

<p>The convictions come as part of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981">ongoing tension</a> [BBC backgrounder] between the Indonesian government and the Papuan separatist movement, on which HRW published a report in 2007.

Judge David Flanagan said that the state did not produce enough evidence to show that the injunction will cause it irreparable harm. He ruled that it is more likely removal of the injunction will cause irreparable harm to voters:<blockquote>It is the essence of what has been persuasively shown thus far in this case that a vital interest of the public will be harmed if the injunction is not maintained. The public interest is served by the temporary injunction, not harmed.</blockquote>The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the <a href="http://www.milwaukeenaacp.org/">Milwaukee National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons</a> [advocacy website] challenging the law's constitutionality under the <a href="http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/wisconst.pdf">Wisconsin Constitution</a> [text, PDF]. The case is set to go to trial April 16. Wisconsin Attorney General JB Van Hollen said the state has <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/absolutenm/templates/template_share.aspx?articleid=2839&zoneid=19">already filed for an appeal</a> [press release] of this ruling. He said they are hoping to have it reviewed before the April 3 spring election and presidential primary.

<p>The Dane County Circuit Court ruled in a separate case Tuesday that <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-voter-id-law-ruled-unconstitutional.php">Act 23 is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] and issued a permanent injunction against it. The state attorney general said that this decision has also been appealed. There have also been two other challenges to the law. One <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">challenge was filed</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.aclu-wi.org/">ACLU of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.nlchp.org/">National Law Center on Homelessness &#38; Poverty</a> [advocacy websites] in a federal district court in December, claiming that it deprives citizens of voting rights in violation of the US Constitution. The <a href="http://www.advancementproject.org/">Advancement Project</a> [advocacy website] also <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-groups-bring-new-challenge-against-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a federal suit</a> [JURIST report] in February on the grounds that the law is racially discriminatory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The presidential election, to be held on Sunday, comes after Guinea-Bissau's former president Malam Bacai Sanha died in January. Pillay's <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41558&Cr=Bissau&Cr1=">concerns for a fair election</a> [UN News Centre report] stem from the country's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/search/news/guinea-bissau">history</a> [BBC news archive] of being ridden with coups and unruliness after breaking away from Portugal and gaining independence in 1974. Pillay also applauded the people in Guniea-Bissau for their peaceful participation is the election process so far. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also issued a <a href="http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sgsm14161.doc.htm">statement</a> [text] calling on the country to maintain order during the elections. Nine people are reportedly candidates for the presidency. 

<p>Guinea-Bissau's reputation of unrest and violence has been in the news before.

The ruling is expected to force the country's government officials to reconsider Italy's <a href="http://dalje.com/en-world/italian-court-addresses-same-sex-marriage/424851">ban on same-sex marriage</a> [UPI report]. The ban on same sex-marriage has been controversial, but a 2010 attempt to overturn it was unsuccessful. After hearing arguments from same-sex couples, Italy's Constitutional Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/italy-high-court-upholds-same-sex.php">upheld the ban</a> [JURIST report]. In 2007, Italy's Cabinet <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/italy-cabinet-approves-same-sex-rights.php">approved a controversial proposal</a> [JURIST report] to grant a number of legal rights to unmarried couples, including those of the same sex. The proposal, harshly criticized by the country's <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/italy-justice-minister-opposes.php">justice minister</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2007/01/top-italian-bishop-denounces-same-sex.php">bishop</a> [JURIST reports], ultimately failed. Italy is one of few Western European nations that does not offer legal recognition to same-sex couples.

<p>Italy is not the only European country that has been in the news regarding same sex-marriage. In June 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled 4-3 that the European Convention on Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/europe-court-finds-no-right-to-same-sex-marriage.php">does not mandate that member states recognize same-sex marriages</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June 2010, the Icelandic Althingi unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/iceland-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. In May 2010, Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva signed a bill that <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/portugal-president-ratifies-same-sex-marriage-law.php">legalizes same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report] but stops short of allowing same-sex couples to adopt. The bill was approved by the Portuguese Parliament in January and found to be constitutional by the Constitutional Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Pillay focused on three issues: impunity for certain individuals, insecurity and violence, and rights of indigenous peoples. Pillay commended Guatemala for ratifying the <a href="http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/romefra.htm">Rome Statute</a> [text] and bringing some human rights violations to justice, such as the <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/former-guatemala-soldier-sentenced-to-6060-years-in-prison-for-role-in-1982-massacre.php">Dos Erres massacre</a> [JURIST report], but said additional reform was still needed before courts were truly independent and impartial. Pillay urged the government to continue fighting against crime, without using the high crime rate as an excuse to operate outside the law, by addressing the root causes of crime. Finally, Pillay stated that indigenous peoples must be allowed to participate in government decisions and be allowed to defend their rights.

<p>The Guatemalan civil war, which <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1215811.stm">lasted from 1960-1996</a> [BBC timeline] resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, mostly among Guatemala's large indigenous Mayan population. According to a <a href="http://shr.aaas.org/guatemala/ceh/report/spanish/toc.html">UN report</a> [text, in Spanish] released in 1999, the military was responsible for 95 percent of those deaths. Earlier this month a Guatemalan judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/former-guatemala-dictator-denied-amnesty.php">denied amnesty</a> [JURIST report] to former dictator Effan Rios Montt, who was in power during the Dos Erres massacre. In February, JURIST guest columnist and Director of the Guatemala Human Rights Commission Kelsey Alford-Jones <a href="/hotline/2012/02/kelsey-alford-jones-montt.php">opined</a> [JURIST op-ed] that prosecuting Rios Montt was necessary to bring justice to his victims, as well as strengthen the Guatemalan judiciary. In August a Guatemalan court <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/guatemala-court-sentences-ex-soldiers-to-6000-years.php">sentenced four former soldiers</a> [JURIST report] to over 6,000 years in prison on war crimes charges related to the Dos Erres massacre.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The judge, however, ordered his release because of his age so that he could receive proper care while the verdict was being appealed.

The detainees documented in the new report were allegedly sent to this facility after July, when NATO and US forces were supposed to have stopped sending prisoners there due to torture allegations. US officials have not commented on the new report, but are cited in it as denying transfers of prisoners to the NDS Kandahar facility.

<p>After release of the UN report in October, Afghan officials <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/afghanistan-government-denies-un-torture-allegations.php">denied the torture allegations</a> [JURIST report], saying there was no basis for the UN's findings. Afghanistan has a history of criticism for human rights abuses. In September, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] alleged that the Afghan Local Police had been committing <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/afghanistan-police-committing-serious-abuses-hrw.php">serious human rights violations</a> [JURIST report], including rape, murder, abduction, forced land seizures and illegal raids. Last March, the UN released a report alleging that the Afghan government's corruption and short-term security goals were <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/afghanistan-rights-abuses-leading-to.php">intensifying the country's poverty issues</a> [JURIST report]. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay also delivered a report earlier that month saying that the government was <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/un-rights-chief-warns-afghanistan.php">stalling human rights progress</a> [JURIST report] through abuse of power and violence against women.</p>]]></content:encoded>

According to AI's report, entitled, "Libya: The forgotten victims of NATO Strikes," numerous civilians were either injured or killed in the strikes, and NATO has failed to conduct investigations or contact survivors. AI called on NATO to investigate the strikes and provide reparations for those injured and the families of victims. AI seeks a determination as to whether the deaths of Libyan civilians were a result of violations of international law and, if so, claims the perpetrators should be brought to justice. AI reported:<blockquote>The four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their two Additional Protocols of 1977 are among the principal IHL [International Humanitarian Law] instruments. Many of the specific rules included in these treaties form part of customary IHL and are thus binding on all parties to any type of armed conflict, including on armed groups. Violations of many of these rules can constitute war crimes. All of the principles and rules cited in this briefing are part of customary international law and are binding on all parties to an armed conflict.</blockquote>According to the report, many of the civilian casualties were the result of strikes on private homes and no evidence demonstrated that these houses were used for military purposes. 

<p>Allegations of war crimes and human rights violations have been widespread during the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">Libya conflict</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. Last month AI released a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/libya-leaders-abusing-torturing-gaddafi-supporters-ai.php">report</a> [JURIST report] accusing the ruling <a href="http://www.ntclibya.org/english/">National Transitional Council</a> (NTC) [official website] in Libya of allowing the abuse and torture of supporters of former leader Gaddafi by unofficial militias. In January AI reported the recent deaths of several Libyan detainees who were apparently <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/libya-torture-causing-prisoner-deaths-ai.php">tortured while in custody</a> [JURIST report]. The deaths came amid allegations of widespread torture and ill-treatment of detainees accused of being pro-Gaddafi loyalists and fighters during the Libyan conflict last year. In October of last year AI alleged that Libyan forces arrested nearly 2,500 people who face <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/libya-officials-urged-to-stop-prisoner-abuse.php">ongoing torture and detainment</a> [JURIST report] without formal charges. In September the NTC vowed to investigate allegations of human rights abuses after AI <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/both-sides-in-libya-conflict-committed-war-crimes-ai-report.php">published a report</a> [JURIST report] alleging that both sides of the Libya conflict are responsible for human rights abuses and warning the NTC to act quickly to investigate these allegations. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Respondent Ernest Valencia Gonzales's counsel initiated federal habeas proceedings and filed an exhaustive petition seeking relief, but several years later asserted that Gonzales was incompetent to communicate rationally and the proceedings should be indefinitely stayed pending possible restoration of competency. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/10/20/08-72188.pdf">agreed</a> [opinion, PDF], holding that "although Gonzales's exhausted claims are record-based or legal in nature, he is entitled to a stay pending a competency determination."

<p>In a similar case, <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/11-218.htm">Tibbals v.

International Co-Investigating Judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet said that he faced ongoing resistance from National Co-Investigating Judge You Bunleng concerning investigations relating to ECCC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7002629.stm">Khmer Rouge</a> [BBC backgrounder] cases <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/286">003</a> and <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/case/topic/98">004</a> [materials] and that the dispute had created a "dysfunctional situation" at the court. Kasper-Ansermet, who will step down on May 4, is the second judge to resign from the UN-supported war crimes tribunal. He took over for Judge Siegfried Blunk who <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/germany-judge-resigns-from-cambodia-genocide-tribunal.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] in October due to Cambodian political interference with the court. Also on Monday, former Khmer Rouge leader <a href="http://www.eccc.gov.kh/en/articles/all-you-need-know-about-duch-appeal-judgment">Kaing Guek Eav</a> [ECCC materials], also known as "Duch," testified before the ECCC and <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/352103/second-judge-in-khmer-rouge-trial-quits-over-row-about-new-cases/">agreed to cooperate with the court</a> [AFP report] in the ongoing trials of three other senior leaders accused of crimes against humanity. Kaing is the only former Khmer Rouge leader to be <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ex-khmer-rouge-leader-sentenced-to-life.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] by the ECCC for crimes against humanity and violation of the <a href="http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/CONVPRES?OpenView">1949 Geneva Conventions</a> [materials].

<p>Last month, the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> [advocacy website] reported that the continuing dispute between Cambodia and the UN over the appointment of Kasper-Ansermet to the ECCC <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/cambodia-genocide-tribunals-legitimacy-threatened-by-judge-dispute-rights-group.php">threatened the legitimacy of the court</a> [JURIST report]. A week later, Dr. Mark Ellis, executive director of the <a href="http://www.ibanet.org/Default.aspx">International Bar Association</a> (IBA) [official website], reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/credibility-of-cambodia-genocide-tribunal-questioned.php">legitimacy of the ECCC had been undermined</a> [JURIST report] and that criticism of the court's failure to meet international standards was necessary to promote international justice. In January, the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.shtml">UN</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-refuses-to-replace-eccc-judge-in-khmer-rouge-trial.php">refused to replace</a> [JURIST report] Kasper-Ansermet, who was tasked with investigating two possible suspects believed to be involved in the deaths of around 1.7 million people, after Cambodia attempted to block him. ECCC judges have been criticized for allegedly failing to conduct impartial investigations. Cambodia has argued that the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders is a Cambodian issue and should not be a matter of international concern.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Natasa Kandic, director of the <a href="http://www.hlc-rdc.org/?page_id=14406&lang=de">Humanitarian Law Center</a> (HLC) [advocacy website], <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/serbia-rights-group-alleges-war-crimes-by-new-military-chief.php">accused Dikovic of war crimes in January</a> [JURIST report], pointing to evidence uncovered during the trial of former Serbian president Milan Milutinovic by the <a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website]. HLC noted that Dikovic was in command of the 37th Motorized Brigade, in whose zone of control the ICTY found a "number of heavy and massive war crimes committed." The HLC alleged that, although Dikovic had a responsibility to prevent the war crimes, he did not act.

You can <a href="/supportjurist">read all the details on these pages</a>, but the most direct answer is that it all comes back to budget cuts. Due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.

Capato</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">report</a>] on whether a child who was conceived after the death of a biological parent, but who cannot inherit personal property from that biological parent under applicable state intestacy law, is eligible for child survivor benefits under <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sup_01_42_10_7_20_II.html">Title II of the Social Security Act</a> [42 USC &#167; 401 et seq.]. The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href = "http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Capato_ex_rel_BNC_v_Commissioner_of_Social_Security_631_F3d_626_3">ruled</a> [opinion] that the Social Security Act must provide for claimants' children who were born after their death. Attorney for the Commissioner of Social Security appealed, arguing that the court must defer to state intestacy law, regardless of whether the Social Security Act's definition of child is ambiguous. The attorney representing the Capato family, including twins who are trying to obtain benefits, argued that the federal definition "child" makes clear that children conceived via <A href = "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007279.htm">in vitro fertilization</a> (IVF) [Medline backgrounder] would be included, because it relies on the objective standard of "child." Justice Elena Kagan challenged that assumption by asking, "I'm sorry, you can't point to anything because it's so clear?" The attorney responded, "In a sense, that's right. If everyone knew what the word&#8212;the word 'child' was used to define, I think, the category that people would have had in mind when they thought of a child in the legal sense." There is a <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-denies-benefits-for-child-conceived-after-fathers-death.php">circuit split</a> [JURIST report] on the issue.

<p>The Supreme Court also heard oral arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-94.pdf">Southern Union Co v. United States</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-criminal-fines-sentencing.php">report</a>] on whether the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment">Fifth</a> and <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text] principles that the Supreme Court established in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-478.ZS.html">Apprendi v. New Jersey</a> [opinion] and its progeny apply to the imposition of criminal fines. <span class="casename">Apprendi</span> requires that "any fact" other than that of a prior conviction "that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt." In this case, a fine was determined based on the number of days an environmental violation occurred. The jury only returned a verdict of guilty, without determining the number of days. The judge later doled out a fine. The attorney for Southern Union Co. argued that when the judge fined his client an $18 million penalty rather than a statutory guideline of $50,000 for one day of violation, the court violated the "fundamental principle" of <span class="casename">Apprendi</span> by not allowing the jury to act as fact-finder: "every fact necessary to increase the punishment beyond that which is otherwise maximally provided for must be presented to the jury and must be decided by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt." The Solicitor General stated that since this type of case never required a jury finding of the number of days, there can be no "encroachment" on the jury function. He argued "with respect to fines, restitution and forfeiture, the jury was never given a substantive role at common law."</p>]]></content:encoded>

USA</a> [JURIST report] that graphic <a href = "/jurist_search.php?q=cigarette+label">cigarette label warnings</a> [JURIST news archive] are constitutional. The court decided unanimously that the portions of the <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1256">Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act</a> (FSPTCA) [HR 1256 text] designed to limit the tobacco industry's ability to advertise to children, including a ban on distributing clothing and goods with logos or brand names, as well as sponsorship of cultural, athletic and social events requiring cigarette packaging and advertisements, is a valid restriction of commercial speech. Two of the justices also upheld a portion of a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/default.htm">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website] <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=FDA-2010-N-0568-0251">regulation</a> [text], enacted through the FSPTCA, that requires cigarette packaging and advertisements to display more <a href="http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/CigaretteWarningLabels/default.htm">prominent graphic health warning labels</a> [materials] struck down in an earlier ruling.<blockquote>The textual warnings in this case provide undisputed factual information about the health risks of using tobacco products. Similarly, for the reasons outlined above, there are myriad graphic images that would also provide such factual information. The health risks of smoking tobacco have been uncovered through scientific study. They are facts. Warnings about these risks&#8212;whether textual or graphic&#8212;can communicate these facts. In contrast, what constitutes a sexually explicit video game is a matter of personal taste and sexual morals that is necessarily based on opinion, as enshrined in the very definition of "sexually explicit" that <span class = "casename">Blagojevich</span> examined. A required disclosure announcing that the game is sexually explicit communicates the government&#8217;s opinion that the game is sexually explicit. Blagojevich and the standards it articulates are inapplicable here.</blockquote>The dissent argued that "[the government] has not adequately shown that the inclusion of color graphic warning labels is a properly or reasonably tailored response to address that harm. It appears, from the government's own evidence, that the color graphic warning labels are intended to create a visceral reaction in the consumer, in order to make a consumer less emotionally likely to use or purchase a tobacco product." In response to the dissent's point, the majority countered, "Facts can disconcert, displease, provoke an emotional response, spark controversy, and even overwhelm reason, but that does not magically turn such facts into opinions."

<p>Earlier this month, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the FDA regulation recommending warning labels is <a href = "/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-rules-tobacco-warning-label-requirements-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report], issuing a permanent injunction. US <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/obama-signs-tobacco-regulation-bill.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the FSPTCA into law in 2009, granting the FDA certain authority to regulate manufactured tobacco products. The legislation heightens warning-label requirements, prohibits marketing "light cigarettes" as a healthier alternative and allows for the regulation of cigarette ingredients. The proposed implementation of new tobacco warning labels has also drawn criticism abroad. In Australia, Philip Morris has <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/philip-morris-sues-to-block-new-australia-tobacco-label-requirements.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] to block <a href="http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/tobacco-label-images#.T0-TLnKXT5g">new graphic warning label requirements</a> [AUS Health Dept. backgrounder] recently enacted in that country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Raymond Ranjeva, who served as an ICJ judge from 1991 to 2009, and his daughter, Riana Ratsisalovanina, appeared in court on charges of planning a coup against <a href="http://www.madagascar-presidency.gov.mg/president/">President Andry Rajoelina</a> [official profile, in French; BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7943820.stm">profile</a>]. Military officers marched into the capital city and <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/madagascar-faces-coup-attempt-during-constitutional-referendum.php">tried to seize power</a> [JURIST report] during the country's November 2010 constitutional referendum, but the plot failed. Ranjeva, who had stated previously that he would be inclined to participate in a new government, was <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE6AQ02R20101127?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">charged</a> [Reuters report] shortly after the attempted takeover and released on bail. Prosecutors claim to have found documents linking Ranjeva to the coup, but Ranjeva <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/ex-icj-judge-s-trial-opens-in-madagascar-1.1259864">denies the accusations</a> [SAPA-AFP report]. 

<p>Madagascar has faced <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE6AG1X920101117?pageNumber=1">ongoing political unrest</a> [Reuters timeline], and much of the international community has refused to recognize Rajoelina's regime. In November 2010, days after the attempted coup, voters in Madagascar <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/madagascar-voters-approve-new-constitution.php">approved a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] that lowered the minimum age requirement for presidential candidates. Then 36-year-old Rajoelina, who <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/madagascar-court-approves-president.php">came to power</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 after ousting former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1866530.stm">Marc Ravalomanana</a> [BBC profile], <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/17/madagascar">organized the national referendum</a> [Guardian report] to change the president's minimum age requirement from 40 to 35 years of age. The change secured Rajoelina's ability to run in the next presidential election. In August 2010, a Madagascar court <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/madagascar-ex-president-sentenced-over-protester-deaths.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Ravalomanana to life in prison with hard labor for ordering the killing of opposition protesters in February 2009.

Ryan</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] on a defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Luis Mariano Martinez was convicted on two sexual assault counts related to the alleged rape of his stepdaughter and is serving consecutive sentences of 35 to life. During the pendency of his direct appeal, his counsel brought a collateral attack against his conviction by filing a petition for post-conviction relief. The petition did not raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial despite mistakes by Martinez's counsel including a failure to object to expert witness testimony that was inadmissible under state law. Under Arizona law, the post-conviction relief petition was the first place Martinez could raise such a claim. Martinez brought a second action for post-conviction relief, but the Arizona state courts found the claim to be procedurally barred because of a failure to raise it in the first petition. Martinez is seeking federal review of whether he can bring a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel against his appeal counsel for failure to raise the same claim against his trial counsel. Martinez argues that since the right to effective assistance of counsel extends to the first tier of review, he should be able to challenge his post-conviction relief petition because that was the first opportunity for him to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court held:<blockquote>Where, under state law, claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding, a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if, in the initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective.</blockquote>The ruling reversed a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which  <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Martinez-CA9-Opinion.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that since there is no right to appointment of counsel during a defendant's post-conviction relief petition there is no right to effective assistance of counsel. Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-error-in-a-death-penalty-case-right-to-counsel.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in October. Martinez's attorney argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling deprived his client of his constitutional right to counsel and that counsel should be extended to any "first-tier review issue," especially considering that evidence of attorney negligence could present itself years after the trial. The state of Arizona brought up the costs and impracticality of the rule: "This Court has never&#8212;has never said that every claim that can only be raised for the first time entitles someone to&#8212;to counsel. And that exception, that would&#8212;that would swallow the rule."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UNJHRO investigated claims of election-related killings, arrests and disappearances in the capital city Kinshasa between November and December 2011. According to the report, 33 people were allegedly killed, 83 wounded, and more than 265 arrested and tortured in prison by members of the presidential guard, the National Congolese Police (PNC) and the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). The report accuses the military forces of violating the <a href="http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/DRC%20-%20Congo%20Constitution.pdf">Congolese Constitution</a> [text, PDF] and calls on the Congolese judiciary to bring guilty parties to justice:<blockquote>Members of the Congolese defense and security forces have thus breached the international standards concerning the rights to life, physical integrity, liberty and security of person and in particular have violated Articles 16, 17 and 18 of the Congolese Constitution. ... The competent judicial authorities must ensure that members of the defense and security forces who are allegedly responsible for such violations be brought for their acts before the relevant authorities.</blockquote>The UNJHRO urged the DRC government to immediately release individuals detained after the elections and to prosecute military officers suspected of involvement. The Congolese Minister of Justice and Human Rights has started an investigation into the human rights abuses.

The ultrasound bill's purported goal is to ensure that a woman's "consent to an abortion is truly informed consent." The bill requires an abortion provider to describe the physical characteristics of the fetus to the woman at two-week intervals along with photographs of the fetus. Opponents of the bill assert that it will force women to undergo an invasive vaginally administered procedure in many circumstances. The ultrasound bill will now go to the Idaho House of Representatives, where it is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/idaho-senate-votes-require-pre-abortion-ultrasound-012135610.html">expected to pass</a> [Reuters report]. Idaho <a href="http://gov.idaho.gov/">Governor CL "Butch" Otter</a> [official website] has not yet indicated whether he will sign the bill. 

<p>If the ultrasound bill becomes law, Idaho will become the ninth state to require an ultrasound before an abortion. Two weeks ago, Virginia <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/virginia-governor-signs-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">signed a hotly contested ultrasound bill into law</a> [JURIST report]. In January the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-sonogram-law.php">lifted an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on a <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/texas-governor-signs-law-requiring-sonogram-before-abortion.php">similar Texas law</a> [JURIST report], allowing the law to be enforced. In October a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010 the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878, DOC] imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/assets/iachr_sabar_petition.pdf">petition</a> [text, PDF], which is an equivalent of an international legal complaint, alleges that, during their time of detainment between 2003 and 2004, the six men were subjected to <a href="https://www.aclu.org/human-rights-national-security/summaries-victims-abuse-and-injuries-petition-inter-american">inhumane and degrading treatment</a> [press release] including beatings, cutting with knives, sexual assault, mock executions and prolonged restraint in excruciating positions. States the petition:<blockquote>The US government's own reports document that the torture and inhumane treatment that Petitioners were subject to...was widespread and systemic throughout the US-run detention facilities in two countries. These same reports also document that the torture and inhumane treatment of detainees were the direct result of policies and practices promulgated and implemented at the highest levels of the US government.</blockquote>Asserting that the US government has failed to properly investigate the matter and prosecute those responsible for committing the alleged acts, the ACLU contends that the US should be held accountable on the world stage to ensure the government's respect of basic human rights. The US government has yet to respond to the allegations.

<p>Originally filed in federal court against former US Secretary of Defense <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Inauguration/story?id=122155">Donald Rumsfeld</a> [ABC news backgrounder], the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] in March 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/federal-judge-dismisses-rumsfeld.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] allegations of torture and inhumane treatment by US military personnel against Afghan and Iraqi detainees. There, the court upheld a long-established principle that government officials are immune from lawsuits stemming from actions taken within the scope of their official duties. This rationale was <a href="http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/07-5178/07-5178-1314239-2011-06-21.pdf?1308689287">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] in <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-dismissal-of-rumsfeld-torture-suit.php">dismissing the case on appeal</a> [JURIST report].

Sea-Land Services</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/33/chapter-18">Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act</a> (LHWCA) [text], an employee is "newly awarded compensation" for the purposes of the act when he first becomes disabled and entitled to the disability benefits, regardless of when the compensation order was issued. The calculation for compensation is based on several factors, including the national average wage. Petitioner Dana Roberts was disabled for a period between 2002 and 2005, but his claim was not adjudicated until 2007. Roberts argued that the national average wage when his claim was first adjudicated in 2007 should be used, as opposed to the national average wage from 2002 when he was injured, because he was not "awarded compensation in a formal order" until 2007. In an opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court held that in order to support an administrable rule "that will result in equal treatment of similarly situated beneficiaries and avoids gamesman ship in the claims process," an employee must be "'newly awarded compensation' when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits under the Act, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his behalf." The court further concluded that:<blockquote>[A]pplying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA's purpose to compensate disability, defined as "incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury." Just as the LHWCA takes "the average weekly wage of the injured employee at the time of the injury" as the "basis upon which to compute compensation" it is logical to apply the national average weekly wage for the same point in time.</blockquote>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a separate opinion in the case, concurring in part and dissenting in part. 

<p>The court's ruling affirmed the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/11/10/08-70268.pdf">decision</a> [text, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which ruled that Roberts misinterpreted the phrase "those newly awarded compensation during such period" and held that his compensation should be calculated based on the 2002 national average. The <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-state-immunity-disability-compensation.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] focused on the ambiguity of the word "award," which counsel for the petitioner maintained was the compensation resulting from an administrative compensation order. The state argued that it would not make sense to compensate an employee who has not received an administrative order differently that one who has.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the letter, HRW urged members of the opposition not to commit the same human rights violations that Assad's forces have committed: <blockquote>Human Rights Watch has repeatedly documented and condemned widespread violations by Syrian government security forces and officials, including disappearances, use of torture and forced televised confessions, arbitrary detentions, indiscriminate shelling of neighborhoods, and deaths in custody under torture. Now, in the face of evidence of human rights abuses by armed opposition members, Human Rights Watch calls on the leadership of leading opposition groups including the Syrian National Council (SNC) and its Military Bureau to condemn such practices by the armed opposition and to work to prevent such unlawful practices.</blockquote>Leaders of Syrian opposition groups have not yet responded to HRW's letter. 

<p>Human rights groups have closely scrutinized the situation in Syria since the government began its crackdown against protesters last year. Last week, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] asserted that the Syrian government has <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/syria-has-systematically-tortured-detained-citizensAI.php">systematically tortured its citizens</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier last week, a UN expert on Syria declared that the <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/syria-rights-situation-worsening-un-expert.php">human rights situation in Syria is worsening</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in March the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-human-rights-council-denounces-syria-crackdown.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing Syrian officials' crackdown on human rights. The resolution came on the heels of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-immediate-cease-fire-in-syria.php">demand for a cease-fire</a> [JURIST report] by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] in late February. Earlier in February, the UN-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria accused the government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-accuses-syria-of-human-rights-violations.php">violating international human rights law</a> [JURIST report] after finding that Syrian forces are engaging in torture and killings under orders from high level government officials.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Specifically, in a <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/fileadmin/documents/La_CNIL/actualite/questionnaire_to_Google-2012-03-16.pdf">letter</a> [text, PDF] dated March 16, the CNIL asked <a href="http://www.google.com/about/company/execs.html#larry">Google CEO Larry Page</a> [Google backgrounder] to answer a questionnaire entailing what Google will do with user data it collects, how long it will store the data and whether the data will be linked to the user's identity. Additional issues within the 69 questions include whether Google will track people using mapping or smartphone searches, and whether the company will collect phone-specific information, such as address book contacts. The CNIL also asked Google to provide a legal basis for its new policy provisions in 21 of the questions.

<p>Google's new privacy policy took affect on March 1 despite the claim by EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/justice/index_en.htm">Justice Commissioner Vice-President Viviane Reding</a> [official website] that the policy <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eu-official-google-privacy-changes-are-in-breach-of-eu-law.php">violates European law</a> [JURIST report]. The policy aspects receiving criticism include data collection sharing among Google services like YouTube, G-mail, Google Maps and Blogger, as well as the personalizing of advertisements based on an individual's search history. EU data authorities are chiefly concerned about this sharing of personal information and its compliance under <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/newsroom/data-protection/news/120125_en.htm">European data protection legislation</a> [EC materials]. In addition to its international criticism, Google's new privacy policy has also been scrutinized by some in the US. In February, the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit filed by consumer privacy group <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website] asking the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to block Google's then-proposed changes. Also in February, the <a href="http://www.naag.org/">National Association of Attorneys</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/state-attorneys-general-concerned-about-google-privacy-policy.php">sent a letter</a> of concern to Google, and three US Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-congressmen-petition-ftc-to-investigate-google-privacy-practices.php">asked the FTC to investigate</a> [JURIST reports] the new privacy policy. These concerns were raised despite the company issuing a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/google-defends-privacy-policy-in-response-to-concerns-from-us-lawmakers.php">letter in January</a> [JURIST report] in response to similar consumer privacy concerns raised by other members of Congress. Like the CNIL, US Representatives sent Google CEO Larry Page a <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/us-lawmakers-request-information-on-new-google-privacy-policy.php">questionnaire</a> [JURIST report] entailing the effects of the new privacy policy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Prometheus Laboratories, Inc.</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that patents obtained under <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxl_35_U_S_C_101.htm">35 &#167; 101</a> [text] that correlate the body's biological reaction to different dosages of a certain type of drug are invalid because they incorporate laws of nature. Respondent <a href="http://www.prometheuslabs.com/">Prometheus Labs</a> [corporate website] patented the tests doctors use for determining the appropriate dosage of drugs for treating Crohn's disease and other autoimmune diseases. Petitioner Mayo Collaborative originally purchased the tests produced by the respondent, but then announced that they would attempt to market their own, somewhat different, diagnostic test. Prometheus Labs sued for infringement of their patents. Mayo argued that the tests look at "natural phenomenon" and that doctors violate the patents simply by mentally recognizing the correlation, regardless of what the doctors do with this knowledge. In an opinion authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court acknowledged that "all inventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas." The court, however, concluded that because the processes patented by Prometheus Labs did not transform the "unpatentable natural laws into patent-eligible applications of those laws," the processes could not be granted patent protection. 

<p>The court's ruling reversed the <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Prometheus_Labs_Inc_v_Mayo_Collaborative_Servs_628_F3d_1347_97_US">decision</a> [text, PDF] of the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. During <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-biological-patents-title-to-riverbeds.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in December, petitioner Mayo Collaborative argued that the respondent's patent attempts to protect a "law of nature" instead of the "application of a law of nature," which restricts doctors' ability to make treatment judgments based on patients' reactions to drugs. Respondent Prometheus Labs argued that the courts have permitted similar patents in the past, that the current patent involves only a narrow range of drugs and that it will not prevent future improvements in the field. The Supreme Court accepted a case on this issue before in <a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/publiclaw/supremecourtonline/labvmet.html">Laboratory Corp. of America v. Metabolite Laboratories</a> [Duke Law case backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2006/03/supreme-court-hears-patent-case.php">report</a>] but dismissed it as "improvidently granted" because the petitioner had not adequately preserved the question.</p>]]></content:encoded>

HRW claims that a significant number of civilians are subject to abuses due to the conflict between Myanmar's armed forces and the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8528985.stm">Kachin Independence Army</a> (KIA) [BBC backgrounder]. The report showed through interviews that Myanmar's army attacked Kachin villages, razed homes, pillaged properties and displaced civilians. The army also reportedly utilized torture and threatened civilians in order to obtain information about KIA. On the other hand, HRW reports that the KIA has also been involved in the abuses against civilians including recruiting and using children as soldiers. The report estimated that around 75,000 people have fled from their homes since June 2011, at which time Myanmar's army engaged in armed conflict with the KIA after 17 years of ceasefire. HRW reports that conditions are in violation of international humanitarian law:<blockquote>International humanitarian law, commonly referred to as the laws of war, imposes legal obligations upon parties to an armed conflict to reduce unnecessary suffering and to protect civilians and other non-combatants. All armed forces involved in an armed conflict, including non-state armed groups such as the KIA, are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law. Individuals who deliberately or recklessly commit serious violations of international humanitarian law can be prosecuted in domestic or international courts for war crimes.</blockquote>
The report urged various parties to take measures so that they are in compliance with the international humanitarian law, to assist independent investigations to the alleged crimes, to demobilize child soldiers and to provide the needed aid for civilians. 

<p>This is not the first time that Myanmar's army has been criticized for abuses against civilians. In November, Human rights group <a href="http://www.partnersworld.org/index.html">Partners Relief and Development</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/myanmar-soldiers-may-be-committing-war-crimes-rights-group.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://partnersworld.org/usa/images/stories/crimes_in_northern_burma/crimes_in_northern_burma.pdf">report</a>  [text, PDF, graphic content] which alleged that the army may be committing war crimes including torture and forced labor against ethnic communities in Kachin state. Earlier of that month, however, <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/ban-ki-moon-to-visit-myanmar-praises-ongoing-reforms.php">congratulated</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12358204">President Thien Sein</a> [BBC backgrounder] on the country's ongoing reforms toward democracy. In August, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-rights-expert-urges-myanmar-to-probe-abuses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Myanmar to investigate human rights abuses and improve its rights record.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Petitioners Evan Miller and Kuntrell Jackson were represented by the same attorney, who argued for the court to extend its holding in <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-strikes-down-life-sentences-for-juveniles-facing-non-homicide-charges.php">Graham v. Florida</a> [JURIST report] where the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishments prohibited the imprisonment of a juvenile for life without the possibility of parole as punishment for the juvenile's commission of a non-homicide offense. His basic argument was that "to equate the failings of a child and an adult would be cruel." In <span class="casename">Jackson</span> he argued, "the differences between children and adults, these internal attributes, if you will, these deficits in judgment are not crime specific."

<p>One of the concerns advanced by the justices regarded the age limit upon which to base a ban against mandatory life sentences. In <span class="casename">Miller</span>, Justice Antonin Scalia asked, "What's the distinction between 14 and 15? ... How are we to know where to draw those lines?" Later, Miller's attorney said, "I would hold that children are categorically prohibited from being subjected to [life] sentences," to which Justice Alito questioned, "what's the definition of a child for that purpose?" Miller's attorney called for 18 to be the minimum age needed to impose a life sentence, and pointed out that most of the jurisdictions that have considered the issue in a legislative context have adopted an age 18 minimum for mandatory life sentences. He offered that those jurisdictions that permitted the imposition of mandatory life-sentences did so through a regime that transferred juveniles to the adult criminal justice system where they are exposed to mandatory life sentences, not because of the express will of the people or their legislators to impose mandatory life sentences on juvenile offenders. He indicated that roughly 80 percent of life sentences imposed on juveniles were a result of mandatory sentencing regimes. In <span class="casename">Jackson</span> the attorney argued that Jackson had no intent to kill, and thus, that lower level of culpability could be used as a line by which to bar juvenile mandatory life sentences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Stanford was convicted of defrauding victims in America and in Latin America. Monday's decision overturned a lower court decision that found the lawsuits violated the <a href="http://securities.stanford.edu/research/reports/19981001slusa.html">Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act</a> (SLUSA) [materials]. District Judge David Godbey had ruled against the suits because they related to securities fraud and therefore could not be brought in state court. The appeals court overturned that decision citing that the possible defendants misrepresented the security of CDs as well as the soundness of Stanford's bank:<blockquote> Our conclusion that the allegations do not amount to being "in connection with" transactions in covered securities is bolstered by the distinction between the present cases and the Madoff feeder fund cases. Therefore, we find that the fraudulent schemes ... are not more than tangentially related to the purchase or sale of covered securities and are therefore not sufficiently connected to such purchases or sales to trigger SLUSA preclusion.</blockquote>As these class action suits push forward, Stanford is awaiting sentencing after being <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/financier-stanford-convicted-in-ponzi-scheme.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month. He could receive more than 20 years in prison for his crimes.

<p>Stanford's trial began in January after a judge ruled in December that he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-rules-financier-stanford-competent-to-stand-trial.php">mentally competent</a> [JURIST report] to stand trial. His lawyers were unsuccessful in arguing that he suffered from retrograde amnesia and diminished mental capacity as a result of head injuries sustained during a 2009 assault while in prison. Last year Stanford filed a <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/financier-stanford-sues-federal-agents-over-civil-rights-violations.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] accusing federal agents of violating his constitutional rights. The suit named 12 defendants, including members of the FBI, the SEC and the Department of Justice. Stanford alleged that the defendants used "abusive law-enforcement methods" to pursue a <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/sec-charges-financier-in-8-billion.php">frivolous civil suit</a> [JURIST report] against him in order to gather evidence for his criminal prosecution. In June 2009 Stanford <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-pleads-not-guilty-in.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 21 charges of fraud, conspiracy and obstruction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bouterse seized control of Suriname during a military coup in 1980, five years after the country achieved independence from the Netherlands. He stepped down in 1987 in the face of international pressure and briefly seized power in 1991. Bouterse was <a href="http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/archives/07/19/breaking-news-bouterse-elected-suriname-president-by-parliament/">elected President of Suriname</a> [Reuters report] in a parliamentary vote in 2010. Bouterse, who faces up to 20 years in prison, has staunchly denied his involvement.

<p>Bouterse's trial has been ongoing since 2008. In April 2008, a military tribunal in Suriname <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/suriname-tribunal-backs-charges-against.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that all suspects involved in a 1982 massacre must stand trial, including Bouterse.

In 2009, the <a href="/paperchase/2009/02/suriname-ex-dictator-trial-resumes-as.php">trial of the former dictator resumed</a> [JURIST report] with testimony by a former prison warden that he brought a leader of a 1982 military coup to an army barracks for execution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontvotebutton.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] Judge Richard Neiss refused Tuesday to halt his ruling that Wisconsin's <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/23">voter identification law</a> [text, PDF] is unconstitutional. Neiss had <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-voter-id-law-ruled-unconstitutional.php">previously ruled the law was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] and the attorney general requested the law be enforced while they await appeal of his decision. The law requires a voter to display photo ID when entering a polling place to vote. Neiss's ruling earlier this month found that the law was unconstitutional because it went against the very idea of suffrage by preventing citizens from exercising their constitutional right to vote. Neiss's decision came after another Wisconsin judge issued a temporary injunction on the law. In his ruling, Judge David Flanagan found that Wisconsin's law was <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-voter-id-law.php">more restrictive</a> [JURIST report] than new voter identification laws in other states. When Neiss <a href="http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20120320/GPG0101/120320146/Wisconsin-voter-ID-law-ban-motion-judge">struck down the motion</a> [<em>Green Bay Press Gazette </em> report] he said he did so because when he found the law unconstitutional it is like "it never existed." He does not see any justification in enforcing the law. 

<p>This is one of four challenges to Wisconsin's voter ID law.

Prosecutors in the case argued that a preface accompanying a 1968 translation of the text written by the founder of the <a href="http://news.iskcon.com/">International Society for Krishna Consciousness</a> (ISKC) [official website], commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement, was hostile to other faiths. They argued that the translation was in violation of Russian anti-extremism laws. The court disagreed, upholding the decision of a lower court to reject the call to ban the text. The decision comes just days before days before Russian <a href="http://eng.medvedev.kremlin.ru/biography">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official profile] is scheduled to visit India. Indian officials have strongly criticized the attempted banning of the Bhagavad Gita. Last year, <a href="http://meaindia.nic.in/mystart.php?id=3001">Indian External Affairs Minister SM Krishna</a> [profile] <a href="http://news.iskcon.com/node/4081">characterized the case</a> [ISKC report] as "patently absurd" stating that "we have treated this matter seriously and the Embassy of India is closely monitoring this legal case."

<p>In 2007, the Russian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2007/07/russia-lower-house-approves-expanded.php">approved legislative amendments</a> [JURIST report] to change the prevailing definition of extremist crime in Russian law to include activities taken for "political or ideological hatred." Since its approval, the Russian anti-extremism law has been used to ban allegedly offending materials in the country, including numerous websites. In July 2010, a Russian court <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/russia-court-bans-youtube-for-extremist-content.php">made public a ruling banning access to five websites</a> [JURIST report], including the video-sharing network <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube </a>[website], for what it called extremist elements. The decision came after a video entitled "Russia for Russians," also a Russian extremist slogan, was posted on YouTube. Other sites were <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/youtube-banned-by-a-far-east-court/411266.html">blocked</a> [<em>Moscow Times</em> report] for containing excerpts of Adolf Hitler's book <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/373362/Mein-Kampf">Mein Kampf</a> [Britannica backgrounder], which was banned by the <a href="http://www.genproc.gov.ru/">Russian Prosecutor General's Office</a> [official website, in Russian] in March 2010 after it was found in violation of laws against extremism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Court of Appeals of Maryland</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] on the abrogation of states' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt11_user.html#amdt11_hd4">Eleventh Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] sovereign immunity by the self-care leave provision of the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/">Family and Medical Leave Act</a> (FMLA) [DOL backgrounder]. Petitioner Daniel Coleman was terminated from his job and filed suit under Title VII and the FMLA seeking money damages, alleging that his employer, the Maryland Court of Appeals, violated the FMLA by denying him self-care leave. The FMLA's "self-care provision" entitles an employee to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave per year for the employee's own serious health condition when the condition interferes with the employee's ability to perform at work. The FMLA also creates a private right of action for equitable relief and damages "against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court." In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court held:<blockquote>[Lawsuits] against States under this provision are barred by the States' immunity as sovereigns in our federal system. ... To abrogate the States' immunity from suits for damages ... Congress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations and tailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the documented violations. It failed to do so when it allowed employees to sue States for violations of the FMLA's self-care provision.</blockquote>The judgment affirmed a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which had affirmed a district court's dismissal on sovereign immunity grounds and <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Coleman_v_Maryland_Court_of_Appeals_626_F3d_187_4th_Cir_2010_Cour">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the self-care provision was not directed at an identified pattern of gender-based discrimination and was not congruent and proportional to any pattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia filed separate concurring opinions. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Stephen Breyer and in part by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elana Kagan.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-state-immunity-disability-compensation.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in January. Coleman argued that Congress passed the self-care leave provision in an effort to protect women from employment discrimination by giving all employees, men included, equal right to leave. The state of Maryland asserted that the self-care leave provision's purposes are not sufficiently in line with the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Equal_protection">Equal Protection Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] to overcome states' sovereign immunity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Utah waiting period law closely mirrors a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/south-dakota-approves-3-day-abortion-waiting-period.php">South Dakota law passed last year</a> [JURIST report] that imposes a 72-hour waiting period for women who wish to obtain an abortion. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-blocks-south-dakota-abortion-law-with-72-hour-waiting-period.php">blocked the South Dakota law</a> [JURIST report] in July, saying that it imposed an undue burden on women. Though the Utah and South Dakota laws are similar in many respects, the Utah law allows the 72-hour waiting period to begin after the woman's <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/21/us-usa-abortion-utah-idUSBRE82K05Z20120321">initial consultation with any health professional</a> [Reuters report], while the South Dakota law requires that the health professional be an abortion doctor. The Utah waiting period law is scheduled to take effect on May 7. 

<p>Many states have recently passed laws restricting abortions. On Monday, the Idaho State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/idaho-senate-approves-abortion-ultrasound-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring a woman who is seeking an abortion to first receive an ultrasound. Earlier this month, Virginia <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/virginia-governor-signs-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">signed a similar ultrasound bill into law</a> [JURIST report].

In July, the North Carolina state legislature <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">overrode a governor's veto</a> [JURIST report] to pass a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period for a woman seeking an abortion.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

The case involved a French woman who was denied her request to adopt her civil partner's child, who was conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF). She argued the adoption denial violated articles 8 and 14 of the Convention on Human Rights, which protect against invasion of family privacy and discrimination, respectively. In its decision, the court found that the denial did not discriminate against same-sex couples, because opposite sex couples in civil partnerships are equally denied a right to adoption. The court reiterated that the European Convention on Human Rights does not require its members to legalize same-sex marriage. 

<p>The rights of same-sex couples have been an ongoing issue in France and across Europe. Last June, the <a href="http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/">French National Assembly</a> [official website, in French] voted to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/france-lawmakers-reject-same-sex-marriage-bill.php">reject a bill seeking to legalize same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST report]. In January, France's <a href="http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/">Constitutional Council</a> [official website, in French] ruled that the country's <a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/code_civil_textA.htm#CHAPTER%20I%20-%20OF%20THE%20QUALIFICATIONS">same-sex marriage ban</a> [French Civil Code text] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/france-court-upholds-same-sex-marriage-ban.php">does not violate the constitution</a> [text]. Same-sex marriage is recognized in several European countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, <a href="/paperchase/2005/06/spain-legalizes-same-sex-marriage.php">Spain</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/sweden-parliament-passes-same-sex.php">Sweden</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/iceland-parliament-approves-same-sex-marriage-legislation.php">Iceland</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/norway-parliament-approves-same-sex.php">Norway</a> [JURIST reports], while several other countries, including the UK, France and Germany, recognize civil unions between same-sex partners.

The act does not create a "duty" to test, but allows state employers to dismiss or discipline employees the first time they test positive for drugs. State employers can conduct the tests as frequently as every 90 days. In a <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/index.cfm?action=viewRelease&emailAlertID=3971">statement</a> [text], Executive Director of the <a href = "http://aclufl.org/">American Civil Liberties Union of Florida</a> (ACLU-FL) [advocacy website] Howard Simon criticized the law and expressed an interest in raising a legal challenge: <blockquote>It's amazing that the Governor and the Legislature would move ahead with a law that so clearly violates the Constitutional protections against invasive government searches without suspicion&#8212;especially while a legal challenge on precisely the same issue is pending in the federal court. No one should be surprised if this latest effort ends up in court&#8212;just as the Governor's past efforts to impose urine testing on applicants for government benefits and his Executive Order for state employee testing are now before the courts.</blockquote> Simon said he expects that a court presented with the law would strike it down. A  spokesman for the governor saidthe new policy is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/20/us-usa-florida-drug-tests-idUSBRE82J1A120120320">no different than drug-testing measures adopted by employers in the private sector</a>  [Reuters report]. 

<p>The Florida government is currently facing a legal challenge to a different drug-testing law. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Florida</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-florida-welfare-drug-testing-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] a new Florida law that had required welfare applicants to pass a drug test before receiving benefits. Judge Mary Scriven said that the law might violate applicants' <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment04/">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] protection against unreasonable search and seizures. The ACLU-FL and the <a href="http://www.floridajusticeinstitute.org/">Florida Justice Institute</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/florida-aclu-challenges-mandatory-drug-screening-for-state-welfare-applicants.php">filed the challenge</a> [JURIST report] in September. The complaint notes that the US Supreme Court has held that suspicionless drug testing by the government is an unreasonable search that violates the Fourth Amendment, the only exceptions being for substantial public safety concerns and students in the public school system.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Environmental Protection Agency</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that landowners can bring a suit directly against the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] challenging the agency's order not to build on residential property that is protected wetlands. This case gives citizens the right, under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/part-I/chapter-5">Administrative Procedure Act</a> (APA) [text], to sue the EPA before the agency enforces the order. The decision, authored by Justice Antonin Scalia, allows Idaho landowners to challenge the EPA's order under the <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> (CWA) [text, PDF] to stop development on a parcel of property designated as wetlands. The Supreme Court overturned the lower court's ruling that the Idaho couple had to wait for a court review at the option of the EPA before challenging the order. The opinion reads: <blockquote>The APA's presumption of judicial review is a repudiation of the principle that efficiency of regulation conquers all. And there is no reason to think that the Clean Water Act was uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of opportunity for judicial review&#8212;even judicial review of the question whether the regulated party is within the EPA's jurisdiction. Compliance orders will remain an effective means of securing prompt voluntary compliance in those many cases where there is no substantial basis to question their validity.</blockquote>The court did not indicate whether the plaintiffs could win their case against the EPA, but merely ruled that they had the right to sue.

<p>The Sacketts own land near Priest Lake, Idaho, on which they intended to build a house. After purchasing the property and obtaining local permits, they began to grade the land for construction of a house. They received an EPA Administrative Compliance Order that said the grading of the land was in violation of the CWA and imposed harsh civil penalties for non-compliance. The Sacketts disagree that their property is a wetland under the meaning of the CWA. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/17/08-35854.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] the dismissal of their suit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Frye</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel applies during "all 'critical' stages of the criminal proceedings," including considerations of plea offers that lapse or are rejected. Respondent Galin Frye was offered two deals by prosecutors during proceedings for driving with a revoked license, but Frye's attorney never informed his client about the offers and Frye pleaded guilty. The Missouri Court of Appeals held that the attorney's failure to inform his client about the plea offers amounted to unconstitutional ineffective assistance of counsel. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy agreed that the constitutional protection applies during plea deal proceedings: <blockquote>The reality is that plea bargains have become so central to the administration of the criminal justice system that defense counsel have responsibilities in the plea bargain process, responsibilities that must be met to render the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth Amendment requires in the criminal process at critical stages ... [I]t is insufficient simply to point to the guarantee of a fair trial as a backstop that inoculates any errors in the pretrial process.</blockquote>The court remanded the case, however, so that the appeals court could determine under the <a href = "http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/466/668/case.html">Strickland v. Washington</a> [opinion text] standard for ineffective counsel whether the plea deal would have been held to by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court. If so, the court could make a finding that the defendant was prejudiced by his counsel's failure to inform him of the plea deals. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, suggesting that, because Frye ultimately pleaded guilty, his counsel deprived him "only of the opportunity to accept a plea bargain to which he had no entitlement in the first place."

<p>The court also <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-209.pdf">ruled 5-4</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday in a related case, <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lafler-v-cooper/?wpmp_switcher=desktop">Lafler v. Cooper</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder], that <span class = "casename">Strickland</span> is a "but-for" test to apply where a defendant claims his counsel's ineffective advice led him to a reject a plea offer and ultimately stand trial. The court held that a defendant could prevail on such a claim if a court finds that but-for the ineffective assistance of counsel there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to and accepted by the court, and that the conviction, sentence, or both, would have been less severe under the plea deal than those actually imposed. Anthony Cooper was charged with assault with intent to murder for shooting a woman in her thigh and buttocks. His attorney advised him to not take a plea offer in the belief that there could be no finding of the requisite intent. Cooper was tried in a full and fair jury trial, found guilty and sentenced to a punishment harsher than the sentence offered during the plea deal. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/10a0281n-06.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the attorneys advice amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court agreed that Cooper had satisfied the test, and also indicated that a proper remedy would be for the prosecutor to re-offer the plea deal, after which a judge could decide to accept the deal or uphold the conviction. The court heard <a href = "/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-ineffective-assistance-of-counsel.php">arguments</a> [JURIST report] in both cases in October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You can <a href="/supportjurist">read all the details on these pages</a>, but the most direct answer is that it all comes back to budget cuts. Due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.

United States</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-criminal-fines-sentencing.php">report</a>] on whether the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit violated the Supreme Court's precedent on harmless error. Alexander Vasquez was convicted on drug-related charges on a considerable amount of untainted evidence. However, the prosecution submitted tapes, and the court held they could be heard as to the truth of the situation, where Vasquez's wife stated that Vasquez's attorney said Vasquez would lose the case and should plead guilty. Due to the weight of the untainted evidence, the Seventh Circuit ruled this a harmless error, while Vasquez's attorney believes whether or not the error was prejudicial should be the first step in harmless error analysis.<blockquote>Before the harmless-error analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent the error. And so the question doesn't require any consideration of the error. And the conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the error. They do not address the error or its impact at all, despite a robust dissent which set forth the extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error. They don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't address it at all.</blockquote>Vasquez's attorney also contended that the Seventh Circuit violated Vasquez's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial by determining that he should have been convicted without considering the effects of the district court's error on the jury that heard the case. The Solicitor General argued that if the court focuses on the entirety of the evidence on its face, justice will prevail: "And the reason that I believe that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what the evidence should be saying to a rational jury. But the ultimate question is the rational jury."

<p>The court also heard arguments in <a href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-262.pdf">Reichle v. Howards</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-qualified-immunity-case.php">report</a>] on the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity">qualified immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of <a href = "http://www.secretservice.gov/">US Secret Service</a> [official website] agents. The agents arrested the respondent, Steven Howards, following an encounter with then-US vice president Dick Cheney. Petitioners had probable cause to arrest Howards, who in violation of <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_18_00001001----000-.html">18 USC &#167; 1001</a> [text], falsely denied making unsolicited physical contact with the vice president. Howards later brought a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text] retaliatory arrest claim against petitioners. The court heard arguments on whether the existence of probable cause to make an arrest bars a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim as well as specific matters to secret service members' constitutional rights and responsibilities when protecting the president and vice president. The attorney for the secret service argued the fairness of the treating secret service members as second-class law enforcement agents, when: "Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable cause to make an arrest." Howards' attorney argued that the rarity of suits against secret service members makes setting a new standard a non-issue as well as contending his client did not assault the Vice-President: "I have done, not a scientific search, but I can take credit for a little bit of science involved in determining how many such cases arise. And at page 13 of our brief, we cite in footnote 8 that a search with no time limitations whatsoever going back in LEXIS with the words 'Bivens' or '1983,' 'retaliatory arrest,' not limited to protective details, shows 15 reported Federal appellate cases, with no time limitations whatsoever. So we had a solution, but we really don't have a problem. The only Secret Service case that this Court has ever heard that I'm aware of involving anything remotely like this is <span class = "casename">Hunter v. Bryant</span>. So this is not a significant problem. This also factually is probably not the best case for them to be making their argument that we need some sort of special rules that apply to the Secret Service, given the facts of this case, where Mr. Howards by all accounts walked over to the Vice President, looked at him and said: 'I just want you to know I think your policies in Iraq are disgusting.'"</p>]]></content:encoded>

The law required prospective renters to attest to being in the country legally, and landlords who knowingly allowed aliens to rent property faced the possibility of having their rental licenses revoked. The appeals court held that the ordinance is designed simply to burden aliens and does not serve any legitimate city interest. The court concluded: <blockquote>Because the sole purpose and effect of this ordinance is to target the presence of illegal aliens within the City of Farmers Branch and to cause their removal, it contravenes the federal government's exclusive authority over the regulation of immigration and the conditions of residence in this country, and it constitutes an obstacle to federal authority over immigration and the conduct of foreign affairs.</blockquote>The court affirmed the decision by the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/index.html">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] to <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/federal-judge-strikes-down-texas-city.php">issue</a> [JURIST report] a <a href="http://aclutx.org/files/32410FBOpinion.pdf">permanent injunction</a> [opinion, PDF] against the ordinance in 2010, finding this to be "a national problem, needing a national solution."

<p>In 2008, a <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/federal-judge-blocks-dallas-suburb.php">temporary injunction was issued</a> [JURIST report] against the enforcement of the ordinance. In the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/pdfs/immigrants/farmersbranch_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/dallas-suburb-faces-lawsuit-over.php">filed earlier in 2008</a> [JURIST report], several landlords and a former City Council member challenged the constitutionality of Ordinance 2952, alleging it denied immigrants equal protection and due process rights. The city <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/dallas-suburb-approves-new-rental.php">passed the ordinance</a> after a <a href="/paperchase/2008/05/us-federal-court-strikes-down-law.php">previous law was struck down</a> [JURIST reports] by a US district judge in 2007 as an infringement of federal supremacy in the area of immigration. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Carol Jackson heard a case brought by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] against the city of Cape Girardeau, Missouri after a resident was cited with Flag Desecration in accordance with a Missouri statute banning the practice that has been on the books since 1980. The ACLU hailed the result in a <a href="http://www.aclu-em.org/pressroom/2012pressreleases/032012courtdeclaresmissour.htm">public statement</a> [text] saying:<blockquote>A law directed at the communicative nature of conduct must, like a law directed at speech itself, be justified by the substantial showing of need that the First Amendment requires. ... Here the State does not, and likely could not, articulate an interest that would justify restricting expression."</blockquote>The court's decision permanently enjoins the state from enforcing the flag burning statute in the future.

<p>Though the statute has never been removed from the state's code, it had not been enforced since 1989 when the US Supreme Court ruled in <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=texas+v.+johnson&hl=en&as_sdt=2,39&case=2084618710761560217&scilh=0">Texas v Johnson</a> [opinion] that flag burning was protected under the First Amendment. Since that landmark decision, the issue of flag burning has been a contentious legal issue which has received a large amount of legislative attention. In 1995, 2000, and 2006 the US Senate has <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/judiciary-committee-sends-flag-burning.php">voted on amending</a> [JURIST report] the Constitution to ban flag burning. The closest these efforts came to fruition was in 2006 where the measure failed by <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/flag-desecration-amendment-fails-by.php">one vote</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

Article 12 of the EU's <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:108:0021:0032:en:PDF">Authorisation Directive</a> [text, PDF] contains specific rules for member nations regarding the administrative charges a state can impose on telecommunication network and service providers. Hungary introduced its "crisis taxes" in 2010 in an effort to improve the country's budget revenues. The Commission maintains that these taxes are illegal because member nations are not permitted to implement such taxes for the purpose of raising revenues to reduce the national deficit. Furthermore, the Commission indicated that "increasing the financial burden of telecoms operators could have an impact on consumers' bills, distort competition and impede investment" in the telecommunications sector. The Commission also alleges that Hungary's failure to consult with interested parties prior to implementing the taxes constitutes a violation of EU law. 

<p>This is not the first time the European Commission has referred a nation to the ECJ for imposing unlawful taxes. The Commission referred Spain and France to the ECJ for similar violations in March 2011. That same month, the Commission <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/308&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">began proceedings against Hungary</a> in relation to the tax and <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1108&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">formally asked Hungary to abolish the taxes</a> [EU press releases] in September. The <a href="http://www.parlament.hu/">National Assembly of Hungary</a> [official website, in Hungarian] passed a bill in November 2010 limiting the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court on state budget and taxation matters, effectively <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/hungary-parliment-restricts-constitutional-courts-powers.php">eliminating the court's ability to examine the "crisis taxes"</a> [JURIST report] imposed on banks, energy companies, foreign retail and telecommunication firms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Malaysia's <a href="http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%202/Act%2082.pdf">Internal Security Act of 1960</a> (ISA) [text], which allowed the imprisonment of individuals deemed to be national security threats for up to two years without trial, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/malayasia-pm-initiates-repeal-of-security-laws.php">repealed</a> [JURIST report] last year. In a speech given at a joint press conference with Malaysian <a href="http://www.1malaysia.com.my/about/about-najib-razak/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official profile] in Kuala Lumpur, the secretary-general called for the Malaysian government to "ensure that the replacement laws will be in full compliance with international human rights standards." Razak is <a href="http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/international/malaysia-security-laws-must-uphold-rights-un-chief-says/506561">expected to announce the replacement</a> [AFP report] security act soon, possibly as early as next month. 

<p>The prime minister had <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/malaysia-to-repeal-strict-laws-allowing-detention-without-trial.php">originally announced the repeal of two of the country's strict security laws</a> [JURIST report], including the ISA, as well as a review of other laws dealing with freedom of the press, in September 2011. The <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/detention/">UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-group-urges-malaysia-to-amend-internal-security-laws.php">recommended</a> [JURIST report] last year that Malaysia repeal or amend its internal security laws. These efforts have been made in response to criticism for alleged rights violations, although the changes have not relieved scrutiny of the country's laws in other areas. In November 2011, Malaysia introduced legislation that will <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/malaysia-introduces-stricter-regulations-on-protests.php">enforce new restrictions on public demonstrations</a> [JURIST report], including a ban on street protests and other rules that opposition leaders believe are too repressive. Lim Chee Wee, President of the <a href="http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/bar_council.html">Malaysian Bar</a> [advocacy website], criticized the new public demonstration legislation, stating that "[i]n its present form, the Bill is more restrictive than present law, and must be improved."</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new school policy requires that students who participate in extracurricular activities submit to random, suspicionless drug tests. As a result of her refusal to submit to the test, the girl cannot participate in orchestra or chorus until she submits to the test. The ACLU-PA believes that the <a href="http://www.aclupa.org/pressroom/acluofpasuessolancoschoold.htm">test violates a Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruling</a> [press release] from 2003 that requires school districts to justify such suspicionless tests. The group also believes that the testing violates the ruling because the school district has provided no evidence to indicate why it is necessary to institute such a policy among the students.<blockquote> At no point prior to the passage of Policy 227.2 did Solanco analyze drug use by sixth through twelfth grade students involved in school activities, or the efficacy of a policy of randomly drug testing only active and involved students as a way to address any district-wide drug concerns. In fact, the Policy and statement by school officials indicate that Solanco School District has structured its drug policy to force as much of the student body as possible into the random drug testing pool without considering why particular groups or activities should be included.</blockquote>The ACLU-PA has requested that the law be deemed unconstitutional and is seeking permanent injunctive relief to prevent the school district from implementing the policy. 

<p>Drug testing policies have come under fire in recent years. Earlier this week Florida Governor Rick Scott <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/florida-governor-signs-law-to-drug-test-state-employees.php">signed the Drug-Free Workplace Act</a> [JURIST report], which allows state employers to randomly test up to 10 percent of their workforce. In 2011 Florida passed a law requiring people who receive welfare to submit to drug test. That law was <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-florida-welfare-drug-testing-law.php">temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] in October 2011 and is currently on appeal. In 2004 a <a href="/paperchase/2004/12/fl-court-bars-firing-government.php">court banned</a> [JURIST report] the Department of Juvenile Justice in Florida from requiring its employees to submit to random drug tests. The court there found that the drug testing policy could continue, but only in regards to suspicious employees. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The indictment charges the companies and a number of their executive officers with environmental crimes, as well as charges of damage to public property. A <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/11/23/brazil-chevron-oil-spill/">2,400 barrel oil spill</a> [Global Voices backgrounder] off the coast of Brazil in the Campos Basin in November prompted the filing of these charges. Federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos de Oliveira <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCABRE82K0PL20120321">alleges</a> [Reuters report] that the oil spill "affected the entire maritime ecosystem, possibly pushing some species to extinction, and caused impacts on economic activity in the region. ... The employees of Chevron and Transocean caused a contamination time bomb of prolonged effect." In a <a href="http://www.chevron.com/fraderesponse/">statement</a> [press release], Chevron denied the charges arguing that "[t]here is no technical or factual evidence demonstrating any willful or negligent conduct by Chevron or its employees associated with the incident."

<p>It was announced in January that <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/chevron-officials-to-face-criminal-charges-in-brazil-for-oil-spill.php">federal prosecutors planned to file criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against Chevron officials over the Campos Basin spill. An $11 billion civil law suit has also been filed against Chevron in connection with this oil spill. Chevron is also currently <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/chevron-appeals-ecuador-courts-18-billion-fine.php">appealing an $18 billion fine</a> [JURIST report] for pollution in the Amazon jungle. The judgment against Chevron was upheld in January by a three-judge panel of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. The $18 billion fine, one of the largest in the history of environmental contamination suits, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/ecuador-judge-orders-chevron-to-pay-86-billion-in-pollution-case.php">originally set at $8.6 billion</a> [JURIST report] but was more than doubled for Chevron's refusal to pay "moral reparations" to the Ecuadorian government, as required by the original ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The appeal to the <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> argued that the <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District Court of Washington</a> [official websites] <a href="http://www.wawd.uscourts.gov/documents/HomePageAnnouncements/C07-5374%20Opinion.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] should be overturned for focusing on religious opposition to certain medications, specifically <a href="http://www.planbonestep.com/">Plan B</a> [product website; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/jurist_search.php?q=plan+b">news archive</a>] and other emergency contraception. The DOH seeks to fully reinstate a <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=246-869-010">Washington law</a> [WAC &#167; 246-869-010) requiring pharmacies to deliver and distribute lawfully prescribed medications, devices and drugs lawfully approved by the US <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website]. The state argues that these requirements are legal because they apply neutrally to all pharmacies and serve a government interest. The pharmacies countered, and the district court agreed, that the true goal was to suppress religious objections and violated the pharmacists constitutional right to freedom of religion.

<p>In 2007, a district court decision <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/federal-judge-blocks-washington.php">blocked the law</a> [JURIST report] ruling that it violated pharmacies' and pharmacists' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights. That decision was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/ninth-circuit-upholds-washington-rule.php">overruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 by the Ninth Circuit because the injunction was over broad. Plan B has been the subject of considerable legislative and judicial activity since the FDA approved access to the drug in 2006. Last December, a federal judge for the <a href="http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-revives-lawsuit-over-plan-b-contraception.php">revived a six-year-old lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the Plan B contraceptive. In March 2009, a federal judge in New York <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/federal-judge-orders-fda-to-review.php">overturned an FDA policy</a> [JURIST report] that limited the nonprescription availability of the drug to women over the age of 18. In March 2008, a federal judge in the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court of the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit brought by a physicians' group against the FDA seeking to overturn approval of the over-the-counter sale of Plan B. In October 2007, Illinois pharmacists <a href="/paperchase/2007/10/settlement-proposed-in-illinois.php">considered a settlement</a> [JURIST report] to a dispute over a state law that would have required them to dispense the Plan B pill regardless of their moral obligations to the contraception.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>IACHR: Chile wrong to revoke custody of children based on woman&#039;s sexual orientation</title>

Karen Atala, a Chilean judge, was stripped of custody of her three daughters by the country's high court in 2004 after announcing that she was a lesbian. As the IACHR <a href="http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/comunicados/CP-03-11_Esp_.pdf">found</a> [press release, PDF, in Spanish], however, the court's decision to revoke custody violated Article 24's "equality before the law" clause and Article 1.1's "obligation to respect and guarantee" clause of the <a href="http://www.oas.org/dil/access_to_information_American_Convention_on_Human_Rights.pdf">American Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF], an international agreement to which Chile is a party. The court reasoned that these violations via the discriminatory treatment of Atala had a detrimental impact on her daughters, namely that they were not able to live with their mother for a period of eight years. Explaining that "the interest of the child is a guiding principle for the development of standards and their application in all areas relating to the child's life," the court ordered Chile to pay USD $60,000 to Atala and $12,000 for legal fees. The IACHR's decision marks its first time affirming that discrimination based on sexual orientation violates international law.

<p>Prior to its ruling, the IACHR received an <a href="http://www.madre.org/images/uploads/misc/1332343202_Atala%20Brief%20Final%20ENGLISH%20PDF.pdf">amici curiae brief</a> [text, PDF] filed on behalf of Atala by a host of international advocacy organizations, including <a href="www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a>, the <a href="ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> and the <a href="www.iglhrc.org/">International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission</a> [advocacy websites]. In her <a href="http://www.cidh.oas.org/demandas/12.502ENG.pdf">application</a> [text, PDF] to the court, Atala argued that the allegations made during her children's custody hearing on January 15, 2003 regarding her sexual identity had nothing to do with her function and role as a mother. Ultimately, she asserted that "sexual choice [does] not extend to parental relationships," which was the subject of that proceeding. Before the IAHCR accepted her arguments, Atala's plea was rejected  in May 2004 in a three-to-two decision by Chile's Supreme Court of Justice, which reasoned that Atala's decision to live with a same-sex partner was not in the best interest of her three daughters, as the girls could become confused regarding their sexual roles and could be subject to discrimination in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Sri Lanka's <a href="http://www.llrc.lk/">Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca201112/FINAL%20LLRC%20REPORT.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] in December concluding that <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/sri-lanka-report-says-military-did-not-target-civilians.php">Sri Lanka's military did not intentionally attack civilians</a> [JURIST report] following the country's civil war, but still recommended possible punishment for misconduct and compensation to those injured in specific situations. The UNHRC voted in favor of a US-backed <a href="http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/LTD/G12/115/97/PDF/G1211597.pdf?OpenElement">resolution</a> [text, PDF] urging the country to implement those recommendations and continue "credible and independent" investigations into the alleged abuses. The UNHRC also asked the Sri Lankan government to present a plan for its approach to implementing the recommendations and detail steps they will take to end war crimes in the nation, including unlawful detentions, summary executions and kidnapping. 

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war in 2009. In November, the Sri Lankan government was subjected to criticism for its <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">failure to investigate</a> [JURIST report] issues of torture for past human rights violations and to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] in September <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">sent a report</a> [JURIST report] to the UNHRC accusing Sri Lankan troops of killing tens of thousands of civilians during clashes with the LTTE. In April, a UN panel of experts on Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/un-report-accuses-sri-lanka-government-of-war-crimes.php">found credible allegations of war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed during the country's war with the LTTE, warranting further investigation. In June 2010, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/un-human-rights-commissioner-calls-for-international-inquiry-into-sri-lanka-conflict.php">called for an international inquiry</a> [JURIST report] into the conduct of the Sri Lankan government during its civil war. The LLRC was created by the Sri Lankan government in 2010 to investigate 2009 events in which civilians were killed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The 47-member panel voted <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12009&LangID=E">41-3</a> [press release] for the resolution with two abstentions. The resolution deplores the escalation of violence that has resulted in an ongoing human rights crisis and may rise to the level of crimes against humanity. The UNHCR condemned:<blockquote>The sharply escalating widespread, systematic and gross violations of human  human rights and fundamental freedoms perpetrated by the Syrian authorities, such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters, refugees, human rights defenders and journalists, including recent deaths of Syrian and foreign journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, including of adolescents and children; ...  The attacks against civilians in cities and villages across the country ... by units of the Syrian armed forces and diverse security forces; ... The extensive violations of children's rights committed by the Syrian authorities, including the killing of children during demonstrations and the widespread practice of arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment; [t]he sexual violence committed by the Syrian authorities, including against male detainees and children; [and] The deliberate destruction of hospitals and clinics, the obstruction and denial of medical assistance to the injured and sick, and the raids and killing of wounded protesters in both public and private hospitals.</blockquote>The UN-sanctioned resolution urges Syrian authorities to put an immediate end to the violence and all human rights violations. It further recommends that the main bodies of the UN take appropriate action to address human rights violations, as well as crimes against humanity that may have been committed. The resolution also states that the widespread and systematic use of violence violates international criminal law and necessitates that offenders must be brought to justice. 

<p>The UN has continued to call for an end to the violence in Syria. Earlier this month, the UNHRC <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-human-rights-council-denounces-syria-crackdown.php">voted to pass</a> [JURIST report] a non-binding resolution condemning Syrian authorities for continued bloodshed and violations of human rights. This official condemnation from the rights body came on the heels of a <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-rights-chief-calls-for-immediate-cease-fire-in-syria.php">demand for a cease-fire</a> [JURIST report] by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/newhc.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] in late February. Also in February, the UN-appointed Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria accused the government of <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-accuses-syria-of-human-rights-violations.php">violating international human rights law</a> [JURIST report] after finding that Syrian forces are engaging in torture and killings under orders from high level government officials. In the same month, both Pillay and <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-secretary-general-urges-Syria-to-stop-alleged-crimes-against-humanity.php">called for an end to the violence</a> in Syria, with Pillay asking the UN Security Council to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/un-human-rights-chief-again-urges-referral-of-syria-to-icc.php">refer the situation in Syria</a> [JURIST reports] to the International Criminal Court. Pillay urged an investigation of Syrian government and military officials for possible crimes against humanity. The OHCHR reports that more than 5,000 people have died since anti-government protests began last March. The increasing unrest in Syria has garnered international attention and has sparked controversy in America about <a href="/forum/2012/02/amos-guiora-syria-intervention.php">what its role should be</a> [JURIST op-ed].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The DOJ filed on behalf of the defendants in <a href="http://pdf.countyofdane.com/court/11CV5492.pdf">NAACP v. Walker</a> and <a href="http://pdf.countyofdane.com/court/DCcase_2011CV4669.pdf">League of Women Voters v. Walker</a> [opinions, PDF]. Judge Richard Neiss <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-judge-refuses-to-allow-enforcement-of-voter-id-law-pending-appeal.php">refused to lift</a> [JURIST report] the injunction on Tuesday after the DOJ requested that the law be enforced while an appeal is pending. Neiss previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-voter-id-law-ruled-unconstitutional.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the new law is unconstitutional because it impermissibly eliminates the right of suffrage for constitutionally qualified voters. This holding followed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-voter-id-law.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] of the Wisconsin law by Circuit Court Judge David Flanagan who said that the law was more restrictive than similar laws that have been upheld in other states.

<p>Since Wisconsin's <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=voter+ID">voter ID</a> [JURIST news archives] law was first introduced, there have been four challenges to it, with Thursday's appeal focusing on two of them. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.aclu-wi.org/">ACLU of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.nlchp.org/">National Law Center on Homelessness &#38; Poverty</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> in December, as did the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-groups-bring-new-challenge-against-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">Advancement Project</a> [JURIST reports] in February. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id-state-requirements.aspx">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge David Hittner did not provide any reason for his ruling. The order came just one day after Stanford's lawyers argued that their client was deprived of his Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial. Stanford's lawyers argued that the Houston community was prejudiced due to the publicity of his case via newspapers such as the <em>Houston Chronicle</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal</em> as well as Internet-based social media networks including Twitter, which affected the jurors to the detriment of their client. In addition, the lawyers argued that they were not given adequate time to review evidence to prepare defense.

<p>On Wednesday the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-appeals-court-allows-class-action-for-stanford-ponzi-scheme-victims.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the victims of Stanford's $7 million Ponzi scheme would be allowed to pursue a class action. Earlier this month Stanford was <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/financier-stanford-convicted-in-ponzi-scheme.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of defrauding victims in the US and Latin America. He was convicted on 13 of 14 charges, including conspiracy to commit wire or mail fraud, conspiracy to obstruct a <a href="http://sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] investigation, obstruction of an SEC investigation and conspiracy to commit money laundering in addition to five counts of wire fraud and five counts of mail fraud. He was acquitted on one charge of wire fraud. He may face 20 years of imprisonment. The trial against Stanford began in January after a judge ruled that he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/federal-judge-rules-financier-stanford-competent-to-stand-trial.php">competent</a> to stand trial, overruling a previous <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-deems-financier-stanford-incompetent-to-stand-trial.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] to the contrary. In February 2011 Stanford <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/financier-stanford-sues-federal-agents-over-civil-rights-violations.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] several federal agents of having deprived his constitutional rights by using abusive law-enforcement methods. Stanford was first <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/financier-stanford-indicted-in-7.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] in 2009.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website] adopted the resolution on Thursday urging Sri Lanka to probe war crimes, to implement the recommendations of a <a href="http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/Current_Affairs/ca201112/FINAL%20LLRC%20REPORT.pdf">domestic inquiry into the war</a> [report, PDF] and to seek UN help for reconciliation efforts with its minority ethnic Tamil community.

Regardless of the rejection, Pillay called for an end to activist vilification and warned that threats of violence against activists must cease. The anger over the passage of the resolution follows weeks of anti-US and pro-government demonstrations in the nation's capital city of Colombo.

<p>The Sri Lankan government has faced various allegations of human rights violations and war crimes by civil rights organizations and the UN since the end of its civil war in 2009. A report released earlier this month detailed how <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/sri-lanka-government-threatens-peace-with-minority-group-rights-group.php">current government policies may make it difficult to maintain peace</a> [JURIST report] with minority groups. <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/rights-group-details-claim-of-sri-lanka-detention-abuses.php">released a report the same week</a> [JURIST report] alleging unlawful detentions and torture. In November, the Sri Lankan government was <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/sri-lanka-urged-to-enforce-laws-against-torture-ill-treatment.php">subjected to criticism</a> [JURIST report] for its failure to investigate issues of torture and past human rights violations, and its failure to enforce laws against continued torture and ill-treatment by government officials against civilians. UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml">Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official profile] in September sent a report to the UNHRC accusing Sri Lankan troops of <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/un-sg-refers-sri-lanka-war-crimes-report-to-rights-body.php">killing tens of thousands of civilians</a> [JURIST report] during clashes with the LTTE.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE82M0A620120323?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0">lawsuit</a> [Reuters report] claims Shell is responsible for unspecified damages suffered by the villages which rely on the river for drinking water and farming.  The lawsuit comes in response to two spills in 2008. Representatives for Shell claim that the continued contamination is due to theft and sabotage by locals and that Shell's clean-up process was successful in 2009. However, the villages claim that continued contamination is due to the inadequate clean-up process in relation to how much oil was actually spilt, which is about 600,000 barrels according to the tribes.

<p>A similar lawsuit over water contamination has been <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/nigeria-village-files-1-billion-water-pollution-suit-against-shell.php">filed in the US</a> [JURIST report]. The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/default.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website] granted <em>certiorari</em> in two cases last October to determine whether political organizations and oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell, are <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/supreme-court-to-hear-immunity-discrimination-free-speech-cases.php">immune from US lawsuits</a> [JURIST report] under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). The plaintiffs in both cases allege human rights violations against an entity other than an individual person and the circuit courts have reached conflicting decisions with respect to interpretations of the ATS. The Supreme Court's decision will likely have an impact on the outcome of the Nigerian villagers' lawsuit. This case in not the first time Shell has faced legal action in Nigeria, however. A $15.5 million <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/royal-dutch-shell-reaches-settlement.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] was reached in June 2009 between Royal Dutch Shell and the families of nine Nigerian activists who were killed in 1995. In 2006, a Nigerian court ordered Shell to <a href="/paperchase/2006/02/nigerian-court-orders-shell-oil-to-pay.php">pay</a> [JURIST report] $1.5 billion for its role in environmental damages that took place within the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You can <a href="/supportjurist">read all the details on these pages</a>, but the most direct answer is that it all comes back to budget cuts. Due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.

<p><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong>. Please consider <a href="/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donating to JURIST</a>. Even if you are not in a position to give much, please keep in mind that small donations - $25, or even $10 - can go a long way. One of JURIST's strengths is in the number of people it touches every day, from readers to staff to alumni. If everyone of those people could give just a small amount, JURIST would never have to worry about funding again. We know that not everyone is in a position to give, but if you can, even a small amount can make a big difference. For those of you that are able to give more, please know that JURIST will recognize all donors that give $100 or more on its website at <a href="/supportjurist/honorroll.php">jurist.org/supportjurist/honorroll.php</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 1977 the FDA released a notice that it would hold hearings to potentially ban the use of penicillin and tetracycline, but actually held none over the past 35 years. The federal court order compels the FDA to reissue the notice of proceedings and accept hearing requests from any drug sponsor that raises a genuine issue of fact. However, if the companies are unable to demonstrate that the antibiotics are safe, the FDA must issue an order prohibiting the drug's inclusion in agricultural livestock feed. The FDA had argued that its current regulatory strategies were sufficient and that the proceedings were no longer needed.

<p>Antibiotics are typically used in bulk in livestock feed to promote healthy and robust animals. The primary concern of this practice is that the antibiotics were passed to humans, where there has been evidence presented by the FDA of increased disease resistance to the antibiotics. The FDA has previously <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/AntimicrobialResistance/default.htm">banned</a> [agency backgrounder] the use of other antibiotics, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, from agricultural livestock feed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Robert Bales was charged with 17 counts of murder Friday for the alleged shooting of Afghan civilians, including women and children, in a Kandahar village almost two weeks ago. He will also be charged with six counts of attempted murder and six counts of aggravated assault. Bales allegedly went on a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/possible-death-penalty-for-us-soldier-accused-in-afghanistan-civilian-shootings.php">shooting rampage</a> [JURIST report] in the village and, afterward, returned to his base and turned himself in. It was originally reported that 16 were killed, but there have now been 17 confirmed deaths from the incident. After the shooting, the <a href="http://www.parliament.af/">Afghanistan parliament</a> [official website] demanded that the soldier be given a trial in Afghanistan. The US Department of Defense, however, said that the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=67512">US military would investigate</a> [press release] and hold the responsible soldier accountable.

Authorizing the "temporary" retention of non-terrorism related citizen and resident information for five years essentially removes the restraint against wholesale collection of our personal information by the government, and puts all Americans at risk of unjustified scrutiny.</blockquote>The ACLU pointed out that this expansion appears to be similar to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Total+Information+Awareness">Total Information Awareness</a> [JURIST news archive] project planned and abandoned under then-president George W. Bush in 2003.

<p>In September the ACLU released a <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/aclu-post-911-security-measures-eroding-core-values.php">report</a> [JURIST report] claiming that the US has been diminishing its "core values" with regard to various counterterrorism measures put in place during the 10 years since the <a href="/currentawareness/911.php">9/11 attacks</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. One practice that the ACLU report criticized was the government's practice of using cell phone location data to track individuals suspected of terroristic or criminal acts. The ACLU is currently involved in litigation and investigations pertaining to requests for information filed under the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [text] regarding the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a>'s (DOJ) [official website] use of this practice. The ACLU also supports the <a href="http://wyden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=b29a3450-f722-4571-96f0-83c8ededc332">Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act</a> [materials], introduced to Congress in June of 2011, which would require government agencies to obtain a probable cause warrant before seeking location data. In March 2010, Germany's <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/index.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/germany-high-court-overturns-data.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a law requiring telecommunications providers to store information on telephone calls, e-mails, and Internet use for six months for use in possible terrorism investigations, citing privacy issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The court determined that sentencing judges should take into account certain negative factors affecting Aboriginal defendants: <blockquote>When sentencing an Aboriginal offender, courts must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools and how that history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples. These matters provide the necessary context for understanding and evaluating the case-specific information presented by counsel. However, these matters, on their own, do not necessarily justify a different sentence for Aboriginal offenders.</blockquote> The decision, which involved two cases in which Aboriginal men with long criminal histories appealed their sentences, allowed the court to evaluate whether Aboriginal offenders were being sentenced in accord with the court's 1999 case, <a href="http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1999/1999canlii679/1999canlii679.html">R. v. Gladue</a> [text]. The so-called <a href="http://www.justiceeducation.ca/research/aboriginal-sentencing/gladue-sentencing">Gladue principles</a> [Justice Education backgrounder] require sentencing judges to take an individualistic approach to sentencing and to consider all of the factors that may have negatively impacted an Aboriginal offender to further the purposes of sentencing and rehabilitating the offender. The court on Friday determined that judges were not implementing the Gladue principles and ruled that the principles were not optional and must now be considered.

<p>Friday's court decision may be seen as another attempt by Canada to address past wrongs committed against its Aboriginal people. In November 2010, Canadian UN ambassador John McNee <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/canada-endorses-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the country had endorsed the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [text, PDF], reversing the government's initial opposition to the declaration. The Canadian government described the move as one intended to strengthen relationships with indigenous communities. Other countries have also addressed the wrongs committed against native peoples. In January, a panel of Australian citizens proposed that the country's constitution <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/australia-panel-calls-for-recognition-of-indigenous-population-in-constitution.php">recognize the Australian indigenous population</a> [JURIST report], including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Although Aborigines make up almost three percent of the Australian population, they are not mentioned in the constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Iraq Deputy Interior Minister Adnan al Assadi alleged that some of the police officers may have been negligent in their guard duties or may have collaborated with the prisoners.

A significant struggle is expected between the Islamists and liberals to <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/03/201232411736959254.html">reduce over 1,000 nominations</a> [Al Jazeera report] to 100 individuals to serve on the panel. Half the panel members will be current members of the parliament and half will be other prominent Egyptian social figures. At least 40 of the 50 seats reserved for members of parliament are expected to come from Islamist parties. The domination of the proceedings by Islamists has been extremely controversial. The leader of the liberal Justice Party walked out of Saturday's session after his proposal was rejected and there have been <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/egypt-parliament-debates-make-up-of-assembly-to-write-new-constitution.php">intense debates</a> [JURIST report] among the parties over the composition of the constitutional panel.

<p>The debate follows an Egyptian court ruling last month that the elaborate voting system in the parliamentary elections was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/egypt-court-rules-parliamentary-election-process-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The make-up of the constitutional panel could determine whether there will be an expansion of rights in the country. In January, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on Egypt's newly elected parliament to pursue an agenda to <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/hrw-calls-on-new-egypt-parliament-to-expand-rights.php">reform nine areas of Egyptian law</a> [JURIST report] that impede freedom and restrict rights. Some of the suggested reforms included ending the state of emergency, reforming police law and expanding freedom of expression, strengthening the criminal penalties for police abuse, amending Egypt's definition of torture to be in line with international standards and allowing independent NGOs to operate lawfully in the country. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The SEC is investigating Wells Fargo for potential fraud due to potential material misrepresentations or omitted material facts in a series of offerings between 2006 and 2008, as well as whether Well Fargo misrepresented to investors that the loans complied with the company's underwriting standards. Wells Fargo has allegedly failed to produce documents requested in a September 2011 SEC subpoena. The SEC is also investigating several other firms for whether they failed to disclose material facts to investors pertaining to weaknesses in offerings and has informed <a href="http://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</a> and <a href="http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Home/home.htm">JPMorgan Chase</a> [corporate websites] that they <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-23/sec-asks-court-to-force-wells-fargo-to-comply-with-subpoenas.html">may also face charges</a> [Bloomberg report].

The bill was introduced in response to <a href="http://observers.france24.com/content/20111206-russia-election-fraud-caught-video-ballot-stuffing-erasable-ink-putin-protests">widely disputed</a> [<em>France 24</em> report] and <a href="http://en.ria.ru/russia/20111210/169663206.html">heavily protested</a> [RIA Novosti] elections, which were held in December, and is part of a group of bills aimed at calming opposition groups. Specifically, the bill rolls back some of the more stringent restrictions. It reduces the number of members required for registration from 40,000 to 500, lessens the restrictions on party activities, and shortens the registration process itself. Supporters of the bill maintain that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/world/europe/russia-eases-law-on-political-parties.html">bill represents a drastic liberalization</a> [NYT report] of the country's election laws. Opponents of the bill argue that it will have the effect of splintering opposition groups, and that the provision allowing the registration of multiple groups with the same name will <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/966a952a-7500-11e1-ab8b-00144feab49a.html#axzz1q9TzOqCa">confuse voters</a> [<em>Financial Times</em> report]. The <a href="http://www.duma.ru/">Russian Duma</a> [official website, in Russian] passed the bill on its third reading with overwhelming support, which allowed the bill to move to the upper house for approval. Before the bill can become law it will need to be signed by outgoing Russian <a href="http://kremlin.ru/">President Dmitry Medvedev</a> [official website, in Russian; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=medvedev">news archive</a>]. Medvedev is expected to sign the bill, which will go into effect with his signature, allowing newly recognized parties to participate in elections that are scheduled to be held in the fall. 

<p>Medvedev <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/russia-president-orders-probe-into-election-fraud-allegations.php">ordered an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into allegations of fraud in the parliamentary elections, which were held in December. The investigation was ordered one week after an election fraud monitor <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/international-election-fraud-monitor-concerned-about-russia-election-process.php">issued preliminary findings</a> [JURIST report] of potential widespread voter fraud. There were allegations of voting fraud in both the 2007 and 2008 Russia elections as well. In 2008, the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/defaultE.asp">Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</a> (PACE) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/03/russia-presidential-election-observers.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about Russia's presidential elections due to alleged media restrictions and polling irregularities. In 2007, election monitoring groups <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website] and Golos stated that Russia's parliamentary elections were <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/russia-parliamentary-elections-were.php">rife with fraud and corruption</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_AFGHANISTAN?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">families of the victims killed</a> [AP report] in the incident received $50,000 and the families of wounded victims received $11,000. A US official <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/25/world/asia/afghanistan-killings-money/index.html">confirmed that payments were made</a> [CNN report], but refused to comment on the specific amounts. The amounts paid for victims of the shooting spree are significantly larger than what is normally paid to civilian victims of military operations. Civilian victims and their families are typically paid $2,000 for each civilian death and $1,000 for each wounded civilian. The 17 victims, including women and children, were killed in a Kandahar village two weeks ago. The alleged shooter, Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/us-soldier-charged-with-17-counts-of-murder-in-afghan-civilian-shootings.php">charged with 17 counts of murder</a> [JURIST report], and could face the death penalty if convicted. 

<p>Bales will not be the first US soldier prosecuted in relation to deaths of civilians in Afghanistan. In February, the US Army <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-drops-charges-in-afghan-civilian-death-case.php">dropped charges</a> [JURIST report] against Army Specialist Michael Wagnon, the last of five soldiers to be charged in connection with the killing of three Afghan civilians. In November, US Sgt. Calvin Gibbs was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/us-army-drops-charges-in-afghan-civilian-death-case.php">convicted on 15 charges</a> [JURIST report] of murder, assault and conspiracy in the same case. This will also not be the first time larger amounts of compensation have been given in relation to high profile incidents. In July of 2006, the US government paid a significantly larger than normal amount of compensation to victims after an <a href="/paperchase/2006/07/us-compensating-afghan-victims-of.php">accident sparked an anti-American riot</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.moh.gov.cn/publicfiles//business/htmlfiles/wsb/index.htm">Ministry of Health</a> [official website, in Chinese] and the <a href="http://www.redcross.org.cn/ywzd/">Red Cross Society of China</a> [advocacy website] have been <a href="http://www.redcross.org.cn/ywzd/ywzd_news/ywzd_headlines/200908/t20090826_33972.html">working together since 2009</a> [press release] to put in place a more efficient and less corrupt organ donation system, and <a href="http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-03/22/content_14893835.htm">trial systems have been put in place</a> [Xinhua report] in different areas of the country, to encourage voluntary donations from the public. Due to the inefficiency of the current system, the majority of China's organ transplants now come from executed prisoners. The new system will put in place a national registry and set new standards and regulations for donations. If successful, officials hope it will reduce the country's reliance on donations from prisoners.

<p>In 2009, it was reported that <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/two-thirds-of-china-organ-transplants.php">65 percent of China's organ donations</a> [JURIST report] came from executed prisoners.

The report details accounts from civilians and opposition fighters, who say the government has been doing this since January. The opposition fighters said government officials knock on doors, and whoever answers is taken and forced to walk in front of the army until it reaches its destination. The report also links to two videos posted on YouTube by an opposition fighter. One shows civilians <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8DkmF9NU20&feature=youtu.be">walking in front of soldiers</a>, and the other shows civilians <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEWGAzIHxRI&feature=plcp&context=C4e2a43aVDvjVQa1PpcFMcq299Hx7dfmtttqU_hN9CcsXyG4FM5V4%3D&noredirect=1">walking in front of army vehicles</a> [videos].

<p>Last week, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-rights-council-condemns-syria-violence.php">condemned Syrian authorities</a> [JURIST report] for human rights violations and violence against protestors and journalists in a resolution passed by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/Pages/HRCIndex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [official website]. The resolution recommends that the government stop these actions, and says the UN will take appropriate action to bring those responsible to justice. Also last week, HRW <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/syria-opposition-groups-have-tortured-government-supporters-hrw.php">condemned the opposition forces</a> [JURIST report] in Syria for torturing and executing government supporters. Last month, Syrian officials reported that over 80 percent of voters <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/syria-voters-approve-new-syria-constitution.php">approved a new constitution</a> [JURIST report], which gives the president term limits and allows for a multi-party system. It also provides citizens with <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/syria-holds-constitutional-referendum.php">fundamental rights</a> [JURIST report] such as freedom of speech, press, assembly and association. While some said approval of the constitution was a step in the right direction, other Western leaders dismissed it as a sham that will do little to stop violence in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rights group claim that South Africa has an <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE82P05Y20120326">obligation under international law</a> [Reuters report] to bring justice to those who commit human rights violations. If South African courts allow claims against Zimbabwe citizens to proceed, the courts could be flooded with litigation against Zimbabwe <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1709488.stm">President Robert Mugabe</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=mugabe">news archive</a>] and other top members of the ZANU-PF party, causing diplomatic tension between the two countries. Mugabe has been the president of Zimbabwe for over 30 years, during which he has faced multiple accusations of human rights violations. It is uncertain whether South Africa can legally be permitted to open their courts to crimes that were committed in Zimbabwe.

<p>Zimbabwe has faced criticism from the international community for human rights violations, particularly within the diamond industry. In August the BBC reported that Zimbabwe security forces are <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/torture-rights-violations-occurring-in-zimbabwe-diamond-mines-bbc.php">running illegal mining camps</a> [JURIST report] in the country's Marange area where recruited civilian workers are regularly tortured and forced into labor. According to the report, workers are subject to mauling by dogs, multiple beatings and rape. The camps, one of which allegedly has ties to a personal friend of Zimbabwean Mugabe, were reported to have been operating for three years. In May 2011 Zimbabwe's High Court in Harare <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/zimbabwe-high-court-releases-alleged-coup-plotters.php">ordered the release of six prisoners</a> [JURIST report] accused of plotting to overthrow Zimbabwe's president. The former army officers have been in prison since 2007 after being accused of planning to violently topple Mugabe and replace him with the country's defense minister, Emerson Mnangagwa. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The hearing before the Istanbul 13th High Criminal Court occurred in a courtroom at the Silivri prison, where Basbug <a href="http://www.euronews.com/newswires/1455946-turkish-ex-military-chief-goes-on-trial-for-terrorism/">has been held</a> [Reuters report] since January. Basbug, formerly the leader of all of Turkey's armed forces, was <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/turkish-general-arrested-for-alleged-connection-to-ergenekon-plot.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] in January for his alleged involvement with the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7225889.stm">Ergenekon</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ergenekon">news archive</a>] network, a secular group suspected of <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-arrests-two-ex-generals-for.php">planning to overthrow</a> [JURIST report] the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. Last month, the Istanbul 13th High Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/turkishretired-general-to-be-tried-in-lower-court.php">accepted the indictment</a> [JURIST report] against Basbug after his request to have his case heard by the Supreme State Council, a faction of the <a href="http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/">Constitutional Court</a> [official website, in Turkish], was denied. The request was denied because the charges faced by the general are related to terrorism, and not the result of his official professional conduct. Basbug is the highest ranking military officer to be indicted in connection with Ergenekon. He has maintained his innocence and has characterized the accusations against him as an <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/probes-are-asymmetric-psychological-says-ex-army-chief.aspx?pageID=238&nID=15728&NewsCatID=338">attack on the Turkish armed forces</a> [<em>Hurriyet Daily News</em> report]. Basbug will continue to pursue his case's appearance before Turkey's high court.

<p>Approximately 400 individuals are currently on trial in connection with the alleged 2009 Ergenekon plot. The group allegedly planned to assassinate prominent members of Turkey's Christian and Jewish minority groups, blame Islamic terrorists for the deaths and use this to delegitimize the ruling AKP. Earlier this month, an Istanbul court ordered four Turkish journalists to be <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/turkish-court-releases-four-journalists-accused-in-coup-plot.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from prison while they wait for their trial to resume. Journalists Ahmet Sik, Nedim Sener, Coskun Musluk and Sait Cakir were arrested in March 2011 and accused of involvement in Ergenekon. Critics of the Islam-rooted AKP ruling party contend that the Ergenekon investigation is intended to <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/turkey-indicts-secularists-for-alleged.php">silence the party's opponents and impose Islamic principles</a> [JURIST report], but the government denies any such charges. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The Florida Supreme Court <a href="http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2011/sc08-1871.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF], "the fact that a drug-detection dog has been trained and certified to detect narcotics, standing alone, is not sufficient to demonstrate the reliability of the dog."

A spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/26/us-israel-un-settlements-idUSBRE82P0IZ20120326">announced</a> [Reuters report] this decision on Monday, adding that Israel will continue to work with other UN bodies. The UNHRC launched an independent investigation last Thursday to determine the effect that Israeli settlements have had on the civil, political, economic and cultural rights of the Palestinian people. The US was the only country to vote against the investigation, called for by the Palestinian Authority. The UNHRC stated:<blockquote>Concerning the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and in the Occupied Syrian Golan, the Council demanded that Israel cease all of its settlement activities, condemned the firing of rockets against Israeli civilian areas and called upon Israel to cease prolonged closures and economic and movement restrictions, including those amounting to a blockade on the Gaza Strip.</blockquote>Israeli leaders have condemned the UNHRC investigation claiming that it is biased against Israel.

<p>Israel has faced criticism for its treatment of the Palestinian people. Last month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-group-urges-israel-to-end-residency-restrictions.php">urged Israel</a> [JURIST report] to change its policies that forbid Palestinians from traveling through and living in Gaza and the West Bank. The report describes the policy that causes separation within Palestinian families since some are trapped inside Israel while their family members are forbidden from entering. In January, the <a href="http://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">Israeli Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/israel-supreme-court-upholds-citizenship-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a law that prevents Palestinians who marry Israelis from obtaining Israeli citizenship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/dokumenti__pdf/word/DZak-sprejet-16-6-11.doc">proposed Family Code</a> [text, DOC, in Slovenian] passed the <a href="http://www.slovenia.si/en/slovenia/state/parliament-the-national-assembly/">Slovenian Parliament</a> [official website, in Slovenian] last year under former prime minister <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28312/Borut_PAHOR.html">Borut Pahor</a> [EP profile] and would have given registered same-sex partnerships the same legal rights as marriages and allowed individuals to adopt their same-sex partners' biological children. The proposed law did not permit same-sex couples to adopt children from third parties. Unofficial reports announced that about <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jGCgZYq9Eb_1PnB1n-sW1eN6-L7Q?docId=CNG.2957eb664618157561e8e40d9fcb3254.271">54 percent of voters opposed the law</a> [AFP report], while 44-percent favored it. Last month, conservative advocacy group Civil Initiative for the Family and the Rights of Children, with the help of Catholic supporters, collected and <a href="http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&id=1428986">filed the required 40,000 signatures</a> [STA report] to challenge the law to a referendum vote. Labor, Family and Social Affairs <a href="http://www.mddsz.gov.si/si/o_ministrstvu/vodstvo/">Minister Andrej Vizjak</a> [official profile, in Slovenian] responded to the referendum results, saying that the government would <a href="http://www.mddsz.gov.si/fileadmin/mddsz.gov.si/pageuploads/mp3/izjave_nk/Dzak_minister_260312.mp3">respect the will of the people</a> [statement audio, in Slovenian] and would draft a new proposal. 

<p>The rights of same-sex couples have been an ongoing issue across Europe. The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] ruled this month that the right of a person in a same-sex partnership to adopt his or her partner's child is <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/echr-same-sex-couples-not-entitled-to-adoption.php">not protected</a> [JURIST report] by the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CEIQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.echr.coe.int%2Fnr%2Frdonlyres%2Fd5cc24a7-dc13-4318-b457-5c9014916d7a%2F0%2Fenglishanglais.pdf&ei=cwdqT9mXL4Hu0gGe-fCGCQ&usg=AFQjCNFWDZNRnPDKtdJsYxGM9r0ZU9MSTQ&sig2=FrVMB2ntUqJ7CFwC-OjLdw">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF]. The case involved a French woman who was denied her request to adopt her civil partner's child, who was conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF). She argued the adoption denial violated articles 8 and 14 of the Convention on Human Rights, which protect against invasion of family privacy and discrimination, respectively. In its decision, the court found that the denial did not discriminate against same-sex couples, because opposite sex couples in civil partnerships are equally denied a right to adoption. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The specific provisions involved, &#167; 210, &#167; 212 and &#167; 213, prohibit the keeping of a "common bawdy house," engaging in communications for the purpose of soliciting sex and living "on the avails" of the sex trade. The decision will allow individuals to hire others to work as bodyguards, support staff, etc. to work indoor in "bawdy houses." However, the court maintained that openly soliciting customers remains a permissible restriction. The majority ruling states:<blockquote>The case law recognizes that the right to liberty extends beyond physical liberty to the right to make individual choices that go to the core of personal autonomy. At some point, this concept of liberty must meld with the concept of security of the person, which also rests on the principle of personal autonomy. ... The decision to engage in a particular commercial activity is not akin to the kind of decisions that have been characterized as so fundamentally and inherently personal and private as to fall under the right to liberty. To accept such a submission [that personal life choices include the decision to engage in prostitution] would be to read into a constitutional protection what are economic or commercial decisions.</blockquote> The decision is only binding in Ontario, but the court suggested that <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/Default.aspx?Language=E">Parliament</a> [official website] look to amend the law and a possible appeal to the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/">Supreme Court of Canada</a> [official website] would make a ruling binding on the entire country.

In March 2011 the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to review a <a href="http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/">BC Court of Appeal</a> [official website] decision allowing a challenge to the country's anti-prostitution laws. In 2007 the <a href="http://spoc.ca/">Sex Professional of Canada</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/canada-sex-workers-to-challenge.php">initiated an application</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.ontariocourts.ca/scj/en/">Ontario Superior Court of Justice</a> [official website] challenging the three provisions on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the Charter. The challenge came on the heels of the trial of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/pickton/">Robert Pickton</a> [CBC case backgrounder], who was <a href="http://www.missingpeople.net/2005/pickton_indictments.htm">accused of murdering 26 women</a> [indictment text], mostly prostitutes, in the Vancouver area in the 1990s.

Pillay complimented the committee for focusing part of discussions on the effects that enforced disappearances have on women and children and expressed concern that women who are victims of enforced disappearance may become more vulnerable to sexual and violent assaults. She reiterated her support for the committee's focus on combating enforced disappearances by stating she and her staff will continue to provide committee members with "substantive and technical support." Pillay also spoke of the need to strengthen the treaty body by stating:<blockquote>The treaty body system has had significant influence on the enjoyment of human rights across the globe, and I believe that this influence is increasing. At the same time, the system has also grown exponentially in recent years, today comprising 10 treaty bodies and 172 experts. While this growth holds great potential, it has not been matched with a commensurate increase in the human and financial resources that are indispensable for adequately supporting the system.</blockquote>Pillay said she hoped the end result would be a treaty system that would work both "efficiently and effectively."

In August the UN <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/un-calls-for-end-to-enforced-disappearances.php">called for all states to end</a> [JURIST report] the "heinous crime" of enforced or involuntary disappearances. Enforced disappearances refers to the practice of placing people in secret detentions for weeks or months without ever being brought before a judge. Some victims of the practice say they were tortured during their detainment. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Our spring fund drive ends in just a few days, and we still have a lot of work to do. As previously mentioned, due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.

<p>Please consider <a href="/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donating to JURIST</a>. Even if you are not in a position to give much, please keep in mind that small donations - $25, or even $10 - can go a long way. One of JURIST's strengths is in the number of people it touches every day, from readers to staff to alumni. If everyone of those people could give just a small amount, JURIST would never have to worry about funding again. We know that not everyone is in a position to give, but if you can, even a small amount can make a big difference. For those of you that are able to give more, please know that JURIST will recognize all donors that give $100 or more on its website at <a href="/supportjurist/honorroll.php">jurist.org/supportjurist/honorroll.php</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Florida</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">report</a>] on whether the suit brought by challengers of the minimum coverage provision of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] is barred by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7421">Anti-Injunction Act of 1867</a> (AIA) [text]. The PPACA requires that most citizens obtain health insurance by January 1, 2014, and prescribes a financial penalty for those who do not comply. The AIA forbids lawsuits that challenge a tax before that tax has been collected. Because the PPACA penalty is contained in the Internal Revenue Code and is to be collected via federal tax returns, the AIA arguably prevents the court from hearing the challenge to the PPACA on its merits. Interestingly none of the parties to the case advocated such an application of the AIA. The court appointed Washington attorney Robert Long as special counsel to argue that the AIA is "jurisdictional" and thus categorically prevents courts from hearing challenges to covered tax provisions, including the PPACA individual mandate penalty. Alternatively the AIA could be construed as a mandatory claim-processing rule, under which parties may agree to waive its application, and federal courts could make equitable exceptions in order to hear and decide certain cases that would otherwise be barred.

<p>Regardless, the PPACA penalty must be considered a tax for the AIA to apply at all, a point argued by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli. Because the government has an "exceedingly strong interest" in generally preventing challenges to other tax provisions, as a function of "history and context," Verrilli conceded Long's claim that the AIA is jurisdictional. Instead Verrilli argued that the PPACA individual mandate penalty is not a tax, evidenced by the decision by Congress to specifically term the measure a "penalty" instead of a tax. The court noted that Verrilli walked a fine line in his categorization of the penalty, since he later plans to present the individual mandate as authorized by the legislature's Article I taxing power, under which he claims the "penalty" label is irrelevant. The challengers of the individual mandate agreed with Verrilli that the AIA does not block the case from being heard, mostly because the case to be decided is whether the individual mandate requirement itself is constitutional, and since the requirement is certainly not a tax, the AIA does not apply. The attempt to separate the mandate from the penalty was not well received by the justices, who stressed that there can be no requirement without a penalty, regardless of whether the two provisions constitute separate legal actions and apply to differently sized classes of people. While the court's final decision on the application of AIA will not be published until June, this week's arguments on the merits of the challenge to the PPACA will proceed as scheduled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Smith</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-wisconsin-ban-on-hormone-therapy-for-inmates.php">report</a>], allowing a lower court decision that transgender hormone therapy is a medically necessary procedure to stand. The US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found the <a href = "">Inmate Sex-Change Prevention Act</a> (Act 105) [text], a 2005 Wisconsin law, was unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Act 105 barred prison doctors from providing inmates with hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery, even if the inmate was already transitioning before incarceration. In <span class = "casename">Fields</span>, the plaintiffs were three male-to-female transsexuals who had been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder (GID), with prescriptions to receive hormone therapy and, ultimately, sex reassignment surgery. <a href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/">Lamda Legal</a> [advocacy website], one of the parties to the suit, <a href = "http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/20120326_wisconsin-anti-transgender">praised</a> [press release] the Supreme Court's denial as a recognition of transgender rights:<blockquote>There are particular moments in the movement for transgender equality when we consider it a great victory when a court refuses to hear a case&#8212;and today is one of those moments. ... Although the <span class = "casename">Fields v. Smith</span> case does not mean that all transgender people in prison now have full access to transition-related care, it does send a clear message that medical care should be left in the hand of doctors, not legislators who may be operating on bias and misinformation about the medical needs of a marginalized population. Access to discrimination-free health care is a constant challenge for transgender people and people in prison are particularly vulnerable to limited care. Legislators, politicians and policy makers should not be in the business of making medical decisions. We all lose when politicians get to decide what course of treatment our doctors prescribe for us.</blockquote>The <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FINAL-PETITION-FOR-WRIT.pdf">questions presented</a> [cert. petition, PDF] to the Supreme Court were: "(1) Whether the Seventh Circuit erred by upholding an injunction against a state law prohibiting the use of public funds to finance sexual reassignment surgery for inmates; and (2) whether the Eighth Amendment requires state prisons to treat gender identity disorder with hormone therapy to make an inmate look more like the opposite gender."

<p>Last week, the Supreme Court also <A href = "http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/031912zor.pdf">declined to rule</a> [order list, PDF] in two high profile cases. In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2011-12-14-ADXvR-CERT-Petition-for-a-Writ-of-Certiorari-FINAL.pdf">Alpha Delta Chi-Delta Chapter v. Reed</a> [cert. petition, PDF], the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href = "http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/09-55299/09-55299-2011-08-02.html">ruled</a> [opinion; JURIST <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/ninth-circuit-upholds-university-policy-against-student-group-religious-discrimination.php">report</a>] that a narrow nondiscrimination policy was constitutional and within the holding of <a href="http://topics.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/08-1371">Christian Legal Society v. Martinez</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/06/supreme-court-upholds-all-comers-mandate-for-student-group-funding-at-public-school.php">report</a>]. San Diego State University's nondiscrimination policy required student groups to allow membership despite a list of factors, including religion and sexual orientation. A number of Christian organization brought suit against the school for these prohibitions, suggesting that they would be forced to accept members contrary to their religious beliefs, thus impinging on their right to religion, right to free assembly and right to equal protection. In <a href = "http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/JohnDoeAP.certpetition.filed_.pdf">John Doe AP v.

The suit contended that the Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis should be found negligent for allegedly allowing pedophiles to remain in the priesthood and work closely with children. The Missouri Court of Appeals stated: "The Supreme Court has held questions of hiring, ordaining, and retaining clergy, necessarily involve interpretation of religious doctrine, policy, and administration, and such excessive entanglement between church and state has the effect of inhibiting religion, in violation of the First Amendment. Further, adjudicating the reasonableness of a church's supervision of a cleric&#8212;what the church 'should know'&#8212;requires inquiry into religious doctrine. Thus, Missouri courts have declined to recognize a cause of action for negligent failure to supervise clergy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Simmonds</a> [JURIST report] that normal statute of limitations tolling applies to insider trading cases. The <a href = "http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec16.html">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a> [&#167; 16(b)] states that the statute of limitations begins "more than two years after the date such [profits from insider trading] was realized." The court found for an interpretation of the law where the statute of limitations runs firmly from a reasonable person's discovery of the alleged misconduct, rejecting a rule favored by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <a href = "http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/639/516/364025/">Whittaker v. Whittaker</a> [opinion text], where the statute tolls when the trader discloses all of his conduct, not when his illegal actions are discovered. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court:<blockquote>The inequity of the <span class = "casename">Whittaker</span> rule is especially apparent in a case such as this, where the theory of &#167;16(b) liability of underwriters is so novel that petitioners can plausibly claim that they were not aware they were required to file a &#167;16(a) statement. And where they disclaim the necessity of filing, the <span class = "casename">Whittaker</span> rule compels them either to file or to face the prospect of &#167;16(b) litigation in perpetuity. Simmonds has acknowledged that "under her theory she could buy stocks in companies who had IPOs 20 years ago and bring claims for short-swing transactions if the underwriters had undervalued a stock." The potential for such endless tolling in cases in which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know of the facts underlying the action is out of step with the purpose of limitations periods in general. And it is especially at odds with a provision that imposes strict liability on putative insiders. Had Congress intended this result, it most certainly would have said so.</blockquote>Chief Justice John Roberts did not participate in the consideration of the case.

<p>Vanessa Simmonds filed 54 complaints against Credit Suisse, which were rejected on varying grounds including statute of limitations. She argued that the statute of limitations can be tolled to include the discovery of the trading or even the filing of a report about the illegal action. This view was endorsed by the Ninth Circuit's <a href = "http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7324004540755589567&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">ruling</a> [text] that led to the Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Clinton</a> [JURIST report] that a citizen's ability to list Israel as a place of birth on a passport is not a <a href = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/political_question_doctrine">political question</a> [LII Cornell backgrounder], but remanded the case for a ruling specifically on the issue. The US State Department argued that this question was political because it informs the government's foreign policy toward recognition of Israel as sovereign over Jerusalem. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority, disagreed, due to the suit being based on a statutory enactment by congress:<blockquote>The existence of a statutory right, however, is certainly relevant to the Judiciary's power to decide Zivotofsky's claim. The federal courts are not being asked to supplant a foreign policy decision of the political branches with the courts' own unmoored determination of what United States policy toward Jerusalem should be. Instead, Zivotofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory right. To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if Zivotofsky's interpretation of the statute is correct, and whether the statute is constitutional. This is a familiar judicial exercise.</blockquote>Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, arguing that the political implications of recognizing Israel has far-reaching impact for the US government, and is a matter of foreign policy over which the judiciary has no oversight.

<p>US citizen Menachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem in 2002. His parents asked the State Department to record his place of birth as Jerusalem, Israel, but were told it could only be listed as Jerusalem because the US does not recognize any country as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. His parents filed suit in 2003 based on the <a href = "http://www.glin.gov/view.action?glinID=82638">Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003</a> [text], which allowed listing of Israel. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit as a political question.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The plaintiff, whose name has not been released, petitioned the Tokyo court to order Google to <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120326a2.html">remove his name</a> [Kyodo report] from its auto-complete search function, which prompts users with suggested search terms. The man claims that the search feature violates his privacy by suggesting his name in connection with crimes he did not commit. He told the court that the feature caused him to lose his job and has kept him from finding work because of his alleged online reputation. The court approved the petition last week and notified the company. A Google spokesperson on Monday responded to allegations, saying that there was <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/google-mulls-japan-court-order-to-tweak-auto-complete-feature/articleshow/12421052.cms">no intentional privacy violation</a> [AFP report] because the search results arrange automatically using terms provided by Google users. The spokesperson also said that Google has not followed the court order because Japanese law does not control the US company and because the company's privacy policy does not require removal of terms.

<p>Google has faced both international and national criticism over its privacy policy. Last week, the <a href="http://www.cnil.fr/english/">Commission Nationales de l'Informatque</a> (CNIL) [official website], France's data protection regulator, gave Google three weeks to <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/jurist-the-commission-nationales-de.php">answer questions</a> [JURIST report] about its <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">new privacy policy</a> [text] as part of a Europe-wide investigation on behalf of all European data protection regulators. The new policy, which took effect earlier this month, may <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eu-official-google-privacy-changes-are-in-breach-of-eu-law.php">violate European law</a> [JURIST report] according to the EU's <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/justice/index_en.htm">Justice Commissioner Vice-President Viviane Reding</a> [official website]. Last month, a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-google-privacy-changes.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a suit from the <a href="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a> (EPIC) [advocacy website], a consumer privacy group, asking the <a href="http://ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] to block Google's proposed privacy policy changes. The new policy allows a user's information to be shared among different Google products, including YouTube, Gmail, and Google Maps.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There were 676 executions globally in 2011, with 18,750 people currently sentenced to death. Although three fewer countries used capital punishment last year than in 2010, a sharp rise in executions in Iran, Iraq and Saudia Arabia accounted for much of the worldwide increase. Political unrest and violence stemming from last year's <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Arab+Spring">Arab Spring uprisings</a> [JURIST news archive] in Libya, Syria and Yemen prevented adequate investigation. AI also acknowledged that China and Iran may have executed more people, but the figures were not reported. Executions decreased in the US, the only country in the Americas that executed prisoners last year. Only 10 percent of the world's countries currently use the death penalty and despite the recent increase in executions, the report noted an ongoing "global momentum toward abolition of the death penalty." 

<p>This year's report marks a change from previous years, since the number of executions <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/international-death-penalty-use-declining-ai.php">decreased in 2010</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">2009</a> [JURIST reports]. Last month, JURIST guest columnist Nadia Bernaz of Middlesex University Law Department said Iraq is not complying with its obligation to respect international law on the right to life, and the UN should, at a minimum, demand that <a href="/forum/2012/02/nadia-bernaz-death-penalty.php">Iraq limit its use of the death penalty</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Last year, Illinois became the sixteenth US state to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">abolish the death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. Also last year, China <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/china-drops-death-penalty-for-13-non-violent-crimes.php">dropped the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] for 13 non-violent crimes, including teaching crime-committing methods and robbing ancient cultural ruins. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The decision was based on ICTR prosecutors' <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/155/Default.aspx?id=1174">request</a> [press release; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/ictr-prosecutor-refers-3-cases-to-rwanda-for-trial.php">report</a>] in November for the referral pursuant to Rule 11 bis of the Procedure and Evidence, which authorizes the transfer of cases to appropriate national jurisdictions. Sikubwabo, former mayor of Gishyita in the western Kibuye prefecture, has been charged with genocide, murder, extermination, crimes against humanity and war crimes. He has remained at large. With the decision, the referral chamber requested that the Rwandan government report to the ICTR or the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals on a regular basis until Sikubwabo is apprehended or dead. The transfer of the case to Rwandan jurisdiction will take place within 30 days after the decision becomes final.  

<p>The case of Sikubwabo is the last of the three cases that were included in the November application and transferred to the Rwanda government. The first case ever transferred to Rwanda from the ICTR was that of Rwandan pastor <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=10498">Jean-Bosco Uwinkindi</a> [Hague Justice profile; <a href="http://www.unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=75&mnid=1\">case materials</a>] which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/ictr-transfers-case-of-former-pastor-to-rwanda-court.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] to the national court system in June. Uwinkindi was charged with genocide and crimes against humanity relating to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/africa/2004/rwanda/default.stm">1994 Rwandan genocide</a>.[BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="http://jurist.org/jurist_search.php?q=rwandan+genocide">news archive</a>]. The decision came after the referral chamber found that Rwanda was capable of pursuing the case. In February, the referral chamber <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ictr-decides-to-transfer-second-genocide-case-to-rwanda-court.php">transferred</a> [JURIST report] the second case of <a href="http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=10444">Fulgence Kayishema</a> [Hague Justice profile; <a href="http://unictr.org/tabid/128/Default.aspx?id=65&mnid=12">case material</a>] who has been charged with genocide, complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crime against humanity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The House bill banned women from obtaining an abortion <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/georgia-house-passes-ban-on-late-term-abortions.php">five months into pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. The amended Senate bill loosened the House bill's restrictions by permitting women to receive an abortion after five months into her pregnancy if a doctor <a href="http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2012/03/26/georgia-senate-passes-changed-anti-abortion-bill/">determines that the fetus has a fatal defect</a> [AP report]. Georgia <a href="http://www.senate.ga.gov/senators/en-US/member.aspx?Member=4">State Senator John Bulloch</a> [official website], who voted for the amended bill, said that it would give women who learn that their unborn child would not be able to survive outside the womb the ability to terminate their pregnancy. It is unclear whether the House will accept the Senate's amended bill.

<p>Many states have recently passed laws restricting <a href="/currentawareness/abortion.php">abortion</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last week, Utah <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/utah-approves-72-hour-waiting-period-for-abortions.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] requiring a woman seeking an abortion to wait 72 hours prior to obtaining one. Earlier last week, the Idaho State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/idaho-senate-approves-abortion-ultrasound-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring a woman who is seeking an abortion to first receive an ultrasound. Earlier this month, Virginia <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/virginia-governor-signs-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">signed a similar ultrasound bill into law</a> [JURIST report].

Specifically, the <a href="http://ffrf.org/">Freedom from Religion Foundation</a> (FFRF) [advocacy website], a Wisconsin-based "association of free thinkers," argues that <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=H&billTyp=R&billNbr=0535&pn=2983">House Resolution No. 535</a> [text, PDF], a one-page recognition of the Bible's "formative influence" in the Commonwealth, violates the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/establishment_clause">Establishment Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/billofrights#amendmenti">First Amendment</a> [text], which prohibits Congress from respecting an establishment of religion. States the lawsuit, "The Establishment Clause prohibits the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, its members and officers, from telling citizens which God to recognize, or which holy book to 'study,' much less directing citizens to 'apply its teachings.'" Originally offered by representative <a href="http://www.repsaccone.com/">Rick Saccone</a> [official website] as a "noncontroversial" resolution on January 23, the House of Representatives voted on HR 535 as part of a bundle of resolutions without debate. Saccone has not yet responded to FFRF's allegations.

<p>The separation of church and state has been and remains a <a href="/dateline/2012/02/edward-sanfilippo-first-amendment.php">controversial issue</a> [JURIST op-ed] in American courts. In January the US <a href="www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-county-board-meeting-prayers.php">declined to review</a> [JURIST report] a case concerning whether a North Carolina county board of commissioners violated the Establishment Clause by opening their public meetings with prayers. In July a federal judge ordered a Florida county courthouse to <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/federal-judge-rules-florida-courthouse-must-remove-ten-commandments-monument.php">remove the Ten Commandments monument</a> [JURIST report] <a href="http://www.aclufl.org/images/Dixie10C-1.jpg">displayed</a> [JPG] on its front steps on grounds that the monument's "permanent" nature and religious message violated the Establishment Clause. In April 2010 a federal judge in Wisconsin famously ruled that Congressional <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/36/119">legislation</a> [text] from 1952 establishing a <a href="http://www.ndptf.org/">National Day of Prayer</a> [advocacy website] was <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/federal-judge-rules-national-day-of.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. There, in receiving a grant of summary judgment, the FFRF successfully argued that, by passing the aforementioned statute, the government had improperly endorsed religion in violation of the Establishment Clause.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Our spring fund drive ends on March 31 - that's only four days! Our annual goal is $30,000, so if we can raise another $1,500 during this drive, we'll be 25% funded. . .another $4,000 and we'll be 33% funded. Help make it happen!

<p>As previously mentioned, due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donating to JURIST</a>. Even if you are not in a position to give much, please keep in mind that small donations - $25, or even $10 - can go a long way. One of JURIST's strengths is in the number of people it touches every day, from readers to staff to alumni. If everyone of those people could give just a small amount, JURIST would never have to worry about funding again. We know that not everyone is in a position to give, but if you can, even a small amount can make a big difference. For those of you that are able to give more, please know that JURIST will recognize all donors that give $100 or more on its website at <a href="/supportjurist/honorroll.php">jurist.org/supportjurist/honorroll.php</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Florida</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">report</a>], the challenge to the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>]. Tuesday's arguments focused specifically on the constitutionality of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">"individual mandate" provision</a> [text], which requires every person, with some exceptions for religious and other reasons, to purchase some form of health insurance by January 1, 2014, or be subject to a penalty equal to either a percent of that individual's income or flat rate of $695. Arguments began with US Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued that the mandate is a valid exercise of Congress' Article I <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause">Commerce Clause</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] power in that the choice not to purchase health insurance has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. He argued that, unlike virtually all other markets where Congress may not be able to compel consumers to purchase products, the health care market is one that every person enters at some point, and there is no way for a person to know when he or she will enter. Verrilli argued that an undue burden is placed on the already willing participants of the health care market when an uninsured person is forced to enter and cannot pay. Emergency health care services, for example, must be provided by law, so when a person cannot pay the cost is pressed on taxpayers and willing market participants. Chief Justice Roberts pointed out that allowing the government to compel people to act, instead of preventing them from taking certain actions, is an unprecedented exercise of Congressional power. Verrilli, however, maintained that every person is part of the health care market, and so Congress has the power to require certain actions in order to regulate and promote that market. He also argued that, although the penalty itself has not been called a tax, it is within Congress' <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/taxing_power">taxing power</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] because it serves a revenue-raising purpose, as opposed to a penalty disguised as a tax like the one struck down by the court in <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/drexel.html">Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.</a> [opinion]. He also argued that the Court has previously allowed penalties that were considered fees, not taxes, as being within Congress' taxing power in the <a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/72/462/">License Tax Cases</a> [opinion].

<p>Washington attorney Paul Clement argued on behalf of Florida and 25 other states, followed by attorney Michael Carvin, representing the <a href="http://www.nfib.com/">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a> [official website], all of whom are challenging the individual mandate. Clement argued that Congress does not have the power to mandate that people participate in commerce, a practice he claims is essentially "creating commerce" in order to regulate. He responded to challenges that Congress has essentially created commerce before, for example by creating a national bank, by claiming that such action would not have been upheld if Congress had tried to force every citizen to put money in the bank. He also argued that this regulation is of the health <em>insurance</em> market, not the health care market, and everybody is not a part of the health insurance market, as insurance is not the only way to pay for health services. To bring people into this market, Clement argued, is not within Congress' power to regulate. He also claimed that this market is no different than any other, as a person's choice not to participate in other forms of commerce also results in higher prices for everyone in those markets and loss of jobs to people working in them&#8212;but Congress cannot mandate participation in every such market. Clement went on to differentiate health insurance from car insurance, which citizens of all states are required to purchase, for two reasons: first, people can opt out of the requirement by choosing not to have a car, and second, because state laws mandate car insurance, there is no conflict with the limited scope of the Commerce Clause. Finally, Clement argued that the individual mandate is not a tax, as Congress did not call it a tax and it is not structured like one. He also stated that, if it was a tax, it would be a direct tax and thus unconstitutional. Following Clement, Carvin reiterated that the individual mandate is outside of Congress' Commerce Clause power, arguing that the government's main focus is on the costs that result when emergencies and catastrophes happen to those who are uninsured, whereas the majority of the plans people will be forced to buy cover routine health issues, and people have the right to choose not to purchase and participate in such plans. Carvin also argued that the individual mandate is unprecedented, specifically because in all other markets Congress can only restrict and regulate a person once they have voluntarily entered, but cannot compel a person to enter in the first place. On Wednesday the court will hear final arguments regarding whether Congress overstepped its bounds in requiring states to adopt new coverage and eligibility standards in order to remain in the Medicaid program.</p>]]></content:encoded>

AI claimed that if India allows the execution, the country's first since 2004, it would be moving backward and away from an international trend of eliminating the death penalty. The group highlighted that the recent trend has seen more than two-thirds of the world's countries abolish the death penalty, and that Asia in particular has seen a gradual movement away from capital punishment in recent years. According to the letter, Japan did not execute anyone this past year, while Mongolia became the 141st country to reject the penalty. While India is one of the countries that have not abolished the law, they have essentially abolished the practice, evidenced by the fact that Rajoana will be the first person executed in India in eight years, even though Indian courts continue to impose the sentence. AI "opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, as a violation of the right to life as recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment."

<p>AI sent the letter just as it released the numbers for death penalty cases for 2011, reporting that <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/-worldwide-executions-increased-in-2011-ai.php">executions rose worldwide</a> [JURIST report] last year. This year's report marks a change from previous years, since the number of executions <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/international-death-penalty-use-declining-ai.php">decreased in 2010</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/death-penalty-use-decreasing-worldwide.php">2009</a> [JURIST reports]. Last month JURIST guest columnist Nadia Bernaz of Middlesex University Law Department wrote that Iraq is not complying with its obligation to respect international law on the right to life, and the UN should, at a minimum, demand that <a href="/forum/2012/02/nadia-bernaz-death-penalty.php">Iraq limit its use of the death penalty</a> [JURIST op-ed]. Last year <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/illinois-abolishes-death-penalty.php">Illinois abolished the death penalty</a> [JURIST report], becaming the sixteenth US state to do so. Also last year, <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/china-drops-death-penalty-for-13-non-violent-crimes.php">China dropped the death penalty for 13 non-violent crimes</a> [JURIST report], including the crimes of teaching crime-committing methods and robbing ancient cultural ruins.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Under the new law any person with knowledge of a possible suicide must take action: "Any person with actual knowledge that a person intends to commit suicide who knowingly and willfully assists such person in the commission of such person's suicide shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment." The weight of the sentence varies from 1-10 years imprisonment. The bill protects those who are trying to ease the pain of the patient but do not intend to take the patient's life. The legislation also does not apply to those acting within the parameters of a will or seeking to terminate care for a patient who is unresponsive. The bill passed through the House earlier this month by a vote of 124-45, but it must now go back to the House for approval on several amendments.

<p>In 2009 a sharply divided <a href="http://courts.mt.gov/supreme/default.mcpx">Montana Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that physician-assisted suicide is not banned by state law, making Montana the third state to allow the practice after Oregon and Washington. The court upheld in part and reversed in part a lower court ruling, agreeing with the finding that physician-assisted suicide is not illegal under state law, but giving no opinion on the greater constitutional question addressed by the lower court. Instead, it found in a 4-3 decision that physician-assisted suicide was not rendered illegal under state statute or by public policy concerns. In November 2008, voters in Washington state approved a <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/washington-supports-lethal.php">ballot initiative</a> [JURIST report] that allows terminally ill, legally competent adults to obtain lethal prescriptions without exposing themselves, their physicians or others to criminal penalties. The Washington measure was modeled on neighboring Oregon's <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/index.shtml">Death with Dignity Act</a> [official materials], enacted in 1997 and <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/breaking-news-supreme-court-upholds.php">upheld by the US Supreme Court</a> [JURIST report] in 2006.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Roberts held that the government did not sufficiently prove the elements of the charges of seditious conspiracy, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and other weapons related charges in the case of <a href="http://www.mied.uscourts.gov/USAvStone/">United States v. Stone</a> [case docket]. The government asserted that the Hutaree militia's primary aim was to fight law enforcement authorities who belonged to the "New World Order" with the goal of drawing federal law enforcement into a war. Lawyers for the Hutaree militia maintained that the anti-government statements made by militant members were not serious threats and were made only in frustration. In her order, Roberts wrote:<blockquote>The Government has consistently maintained that this case is not about freedom of speech or association, but about the specific acts of violence alleged in the Indictment. ... However, much of the Government's evidence against Defendants at trial was in the form of speeches, primarily by Stone, Sr., who frequently made statements describing law enforcement as the enemy, discussing the killing of police officers, and the need to go to war.</blockquote>The order contained a specific articulation of the various charges and explained the shortcomings of the government's prosecution.

<p>The trial <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/trial-for-US-militia-group-hutaree-begins-in-Michigan-federal-court.php">began</a> [JURIST report] in Robert's courtroom in February. In May 2010 Roberts granted bail for the nine members of the group. Roberts ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/federal-judge-grants-bail-for.php">bail would be granted</a> [JURIST report] but that the eight men and one woman must relinquish weapons and weapons permits, remain confined to their homes and be kept under electronic surveillance. The group members allegedly planned to kill Michigan law enforcement officers by, among other methods, making phony 911 calls and ambushing those who responded. There is some evidence that right-wing nativist and so-called "patriot" anti-government militias such as the Hutaree are on the rise in the US. A 2009 report by the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> (SPLC) [advocacy website] noted that these groups are <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/anti-government-militias-growing-in-us.php">making a comeback</a> [JURIST report] after declining for a number of years. The SPLC said that such groups are generally anti-tax, anti-immigration, and increasingly racially motivated since the election of the country's first African-American president, Barack Obama. The SPLC also warned that these groups could soon pose a security risk to the country, quoting one official as saying "[a]ll it's lacking is a spark. I think it's only a matter of time before you see threats and violence."</p>]]></content:encoded>

Zbigniew Siemiatkowski told a Polish newspaper on Tuesday that he could <a href="http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,11426413,Wiezienie_CIA__Kto_poprowadzi_teraz_sledztwo_.html">face charges for his association with the prison</a> [<em>Gazeta Wyborcza</em> report, in Polish] and the allegations of torture that occurred there. Polish prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/poland-probing-treatment-of-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-at-secret-cia-prison.php">began investigating the prison and its activities</a> in September 2010 after a <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/lawyers-for-alleged-uss-cole-bomber-request-investigation-into-detention-in-poland.php">request</a> [JURIST reports] was filed by the <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice">Open Society Justice Initiative</a> (OSJI) [advocacy website] and the lawyers of alleged torture victim <a href="http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/10015-abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> [NYT profile]. In March of last year, prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/poland-prosecutors-ask-us-to-question-guantanamo-detainees-over-secret-cia-prison.php">asked US officials</a> [JURIST report] to question two <a href="http://jurist.org/feature/featured/guantanamo/">Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST backgrounder] detainees, including al-Nashiri, who claim they were held and abused at the site. Executive Director of OSJI, James Goldston, <a href="http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/focus/national-security/news/nashiri-rendition-20110126">stated</a> [press release] that, "[t]he United States government should swiftly respond to the Polish prosecutor's requests for information on CIA black sites. The allegations of human rights abuses associated with the CIA's illegal rendition program must be properly investigated to secure justice for the victims and prevent future misconduct." 

<p>Many government officials have come under fire in recent years for special detention and torture practices. In September the <a href="http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/default_en.asp">Council of Europe</a> [official website] Commissioner for Human Rights Thomas Hammarberg <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/europe-rights-commissioner-urges-probes-into-secret-prisons.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Lithuania, Poland and Romania to investigate the roles their governments played in the US CIA's program of "secret detention and torture" of terrorism suspects. In June of that year, US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/ag/">Attorney General Eric Holder</a> [official website] announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/doj-to-investigate-2-overseas-detainee-deaths.php">continue investigating the deaths of two detainees</a> [JURIST report] who died during interrogations by the CIA. In February, human rights advocacy groups urged the signatory states of the <a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html">UN Convention Against Torture</a> (CAT) [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/rights-groups-urge-bush-prosecution-under-torture-convention.php">pursue criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against former US president <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=George+W.+Bush">George W. Bush</a> [JURIST news archive] in connection with allegations of <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=enhanced+interrogation">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> [JURIST news archive]. In January, a federal judge told the CIA that it <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/federal-judge-tells-cia-to-investigate-destruction-of-interrogation-tapes.php">must investigate the destruction of the interrogation tapes</a> [JURIST report] related to individuals detained after <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=9%2F11">9/11</a> [JURIST news archive] and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

DOMA excludes otherwise valid state same-sex marriages from recognition under federal law. In its request for review, the Obama administration raised the question of "whether classifications based on sexual orientation are subject to rational basis review or instead demand heightened scrutiny under well-established equal protection principles." The request for expedited review comes after the <a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-finds-defense-of-marriage-act-unconstitutional.php">ruled that DOMA is unconstitutional</a>, after Karen Golinski <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/federal-employee-sues-for-same-sex.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST reports] against the US Office of Personnel Management for refusing extend health insurance benefits to her same-sex spouse. The federal government is asking for an 11-judge panel rather than the usual three-judge panel to address this issue, as a full bench has the authority to reconsider precedents.

<p>The <a href="http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">US Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/senate-committee-votes-to-repeal-doma.php">voted to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report] in November, marking the first time a Congressional group has voted to repeal the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage. In a similar case in October, a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/us-veteran-appeals-benefits-claim-denied-under-doma.php">disabled Navy veteran filed a notice of appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www.uscourts.cavc.gov/">US Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims</a> [official website] for denying her partner a share of her disability benefits under DOMA. The <a href="http://www.va.gov/">Department of Veterans Affairs</a> [official website] allegedly told the veteran she could not receive benefits because her spouse was a woman. In March 2011, congressional Democrats introduced the <a href="http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.1116:">Respect for Marriage Act</a> [text], which was <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-congress-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-defense-of-marriage-act.php">intended to repeal DOMA</a> [JURIST report], but it has not yet passed. Last year, US President Barack Obama announced that he would <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/obama-reaffirms-support-for-doma-repeal.php">continue to fight for the repeal</a> [JURIST report] of DOMA. Also last year, the US Department of Justice announced that it would <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/doj-to-stop-defending-federal-same-sex-marriage-law.php">no longer defend the constitutionality</a> [JURIST report] of Section 3 of DOMA in court cases challenging the provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to banning abortions after 20 weeks, the bill imposes other restrictions. It requires a woman seeking an abortion to receive an ultrasound <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/community/pinal/articles/2012/03/27/20120327senate-approves-anti-abortion-bill.html">24 hours before an abortion</a> [<em>Arizona Republic</em> report], as opposed to the one hour requirement which is currently the law in Arizona. The bill also forbids doctors from prescribing abortion pills after the seventh week of pregnancy. <a href="http://kimberlyyee.com/">Representative Kimberly Yee</a> [official website], the sponsor of the bill, declared that the bill's intention is to both protect the unborn and to protect women from dangerous abortion practices. The bill passed by a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-arizona-abortion-idUSBRE82R0DR20120328">20-10 vote in the Senate</a> [Reuters report] mostly along party lines. The bill now moves to the Arizona House of Representatives. If the House passes the bill and the governor signs it into law, the bill will take effect this summer.

<p>Many states have recently passed laws restricting abortion. Last week, Utah <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/utah-approves-72-hour-waiting-period-for-abortions.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] requiring a woman seeking an abortion to wait 72 hours prior to obtaining the procedure. Earlier last week, the Idaho State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/idaho-senate-approves-abortion-ultrasound-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring a woman who is seeking an abortion to first receive an ultrasound. Earlier this month, Virginia <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/virginia-governor-signs-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">signed a similar ultrasound bill into law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in March, the Georgia House of Representatives passed a ban on abortions after <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/georgia-house-passes-ban-on-late-term-abortions.php">five months into a pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. In February, the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Texas can enforce a state law requiring women to receive a sonogram before obtaining an abortion. In July, the North Carolina state legislature <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">overrode a governor's veto</a> [JURIST report] to pass a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period for a woman seeking an abortion. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Besigye and other protesters were <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17468289">arrested last week</a> [BBC report] after a police officer was killed while attempting to disperse the crowd. Besigye denies that any of the protesters were involved in the officer's death. Besigye was <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/uganda-opposition-leader-acquitted-of-charges-in-walk-to-work-protests.php">acquitted of similar charges</a> [JURIST report] last August. He was accused of rioting and inciting violence in connection with protests against rising food and fuel costs. The protests were known as the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Ugandas-Walk-To-Work-Protests-Will-Continue-says-Activist-120003879.html">"Walk to Work" protests</a> [VOA report] because participants refrained from taking motor vehicles to show their discontent over high fuel prices. The demonstrations turned violent and led to large numbers of arrests and injuries as well as <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2067136,00.html">several deaths</a> [TIME report].

<p>Besigye's last prosecution gained international attention. He was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/jurist-1.php">arrested in 2011</a> [JURIST report] for his involvement in the "Walk to Work" protests. Earlier that year, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/un-rights-chief-criticizes-uganda-government-for-protest-response.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Uganda's government to stop using what she called excessive force against Besigye and other protesters. Besigye is the leader of Uganda's most prominent opposition party, the <a href="http://www.fdcuganda.org/index.html">Forum for Democratic Change</a> [party website]. He lost to incumbent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1196167.stm">President Yoweri Museveni</a> [BBC profile] in elections held in February 2010. The elections were <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/20/ugandan-leader-wins-presidential-election">criticized by the opposition as fraudulent</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report]. Besigye also <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11524243">ran for president</a> [BBC report] in 2002 and 2006, and, prior to that, he was Museveni's personal doctor. In October 2010, Uganda's Constitutional Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/uganda-court-dismisses-treason-case-against-opposition-leader.php">dismissed treason charges</a> [JURIST report] against Besigye and 10 co-defendants, ruling that there was insufficient evidence and that the state had violated the defendants' rights. Besigye had been <a href="/paperchase/2006/04/besigye-pleads-not-guilty-to-treason.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] with plotting to forcefully overthrow the Ugandan government between 2001 and 2004 but had always maintained his innocence, calling the charges against him politically motivated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the two cases, <span class="casename">NAACP v. Walker</span> and <span class="casename">League of Women Voters v. Walker</span>, the plaintiffs assert that Wisconsin's voter ID law is too restrictive and prevents many minority, poor and elderly voters from casting a ballot. Last week, the Wisconsin <a href="http://www.doj.state.wi.us/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-doj-appeals-injunction-on-new-voter-id-law.php">appealed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] blocking the law, arguing that the voter ID law is necessary to prevent voter fraud. Judge Richard Neiss <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-judge-refuses-to-allow-enforcement-of-voter-id-law-pending-appeal.php">refused to lift</a> [JURIST report] the injunction last week after the DOJ requested that the law be enforced while an appeal is pending. It is unclear when the Wisconsin Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of the voter ID law.

<p>Neiss previously <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-voter-id-law-ruled-unconstitutional.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that the new law is unconstitutional because it impermissibly eliminates the right of suffrage for constitutionally qualified voters. This holding followed a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-voter-id-law.php">temporary injunction</a> [JURIST report] of the Wisconsin law by Circuit Court Judge David Flanagan who said that the law was more restrictive than similar laws that have been upheld in other states. Since Wisconsin's voter ID law was first introduced, there have been four challenges to it. The <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), the <a href="http://www.aclu-wi.org/">ACLU of Wisconsin</a> and the <a href="http://www.nlchp.org/">National Law Center on Homelessness &#38; Poverty</a> [advocacy websites] <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/aclu-challenges-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">filed a federal lawsuit</a> in December, as did the <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rights-groups-bring-new-challenge-against-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">Advancement Project</a> [JURIST reports] in February. There are now <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/voter-id-state-requirements.aspx">31 US states</a> [NCSL backgrounder] that require voters to present some form of ID at the polls, including 15 states that require photo ID, but the issue remains controversial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Cooper</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the phrase "actual damages" as found in the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sec_05_00000552---a000-.html">Privacy Act of 1974</a> [5 USC &#167; 552a] is sufficiently ambiguous to prevent the authorization of lawsuits against the government for claims of mental and emotional distress. Respondent Cooper, a pilot, was convicted and fined for failing to disclose to the <a href="http://www.faa.gov/">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) that he had HIV, a fact that was illegally revealed by the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Administration</a> (SSA) [official websites] where Cooper sought disability based on his HIV status. The Privacy Act contains a detailed set of requirements for the management of records held by executive branch agencies and allows an aggrieved individual to sue for "actual damages" if the government intentionally or willfully violates the Act's requirements in such a way as to adversely affect the individual. In an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, the court decided:<blockquote>[A]pplying traditional rules of construction, we hold that the Privacy Act does not unequivocally authorize an award of damages for mental or emotional distress. Accordingly, the Act does not waive the Federal Government's sovereign immunity from liability for such harms.</blockquote>The judgment reversed a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/Cooper_v_Federal_Aviation_Administration_622_F3d_1016_9th_Cir_201">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that "actual damages" as termed in the Act is not ambiguous and includes damages for mental and emotional distress. Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Justice Elena Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-federal-sentencing-government-liability-for-emotional-damages-under.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in December. The government argued that Congress, by specifically excluding general damages, did not provide for damages for mental and emotional distress or, at least, did not clearly waive sovereign immunity. Asserting the dichotomy of special (or economic) damages versus general damages, inclusive of damages for mental and emotional distress, the government insisted that only damages of pecuniary nature could be recovered from the government under the Privacy Act. Cooper insisted that the government's argument unnecessarily introduced ambiguity into the statute, undermining the purpose of the Act, and that the plain meaning of "actual damages" is <em>proved</em> damages, as opposed to <em>presumed</em> damages. Cooper further argued that under the government's construction of the statute, intentional and willful violations of the act, such as a whistleblower the government wants to silence by leaking embarrassing details to the press as opposed to outright firing, would have no remedy because they are not out of pocket any money.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Our spring fund drive ends on March 31 - that's only THREE days! Our annual goal is $30,000, so if we can raise another $1,100 during this drive, we'll be 25% funded. . .another $3,600 and we'll be 33% funded. Help make it happen!

<p>As previously mentioned, due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donating to JURIST</a>. Even if you are not in a position to give much, please keep in mind that small donations - $25, or even $10 - can go a long way. One of JURIST's strengths is in the number of people it touches every day, from readers to staff to alumni. If everyone of those people could give just a small amount, JURIST would never have to worry about funding again. We know that not everyone is in a position to give, but if you can, even a small amount can make a big difference. For those of you that are able to give more, please know that JURIST will recognize all donors that give $100 or more on its website at <a href="/supportjurist/honorroll.php">jurist.org/supportjurist/honorroll.php</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

United States</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] on whether a federal district court, in sentencing a defendant for a federal offense, has authority to order that the federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence that has not yet been imposed. Petitioner Setser was indicted in a Texas court on drug charges, and the state moved to revoke the probation term that he was then serving for another drug offense. At about the same time Setser pleaded guilty to federal drug charges, and the federal district court imposed a 151-month sentence to run consecutively to any state sentence imposed for the probation violation, but concurrently with any state sentence imposed on the new drug charge. The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/718/usc_sec_18_00003584----000-.html">Sentencing Reform Act of 1984</a> (SRA) [18 USC &#167; 3584] addresses only "multiple terms of imprisonment ... imposed ... at the same time" whereas Setser's state sentence was not imposed at the same time as the federal sentence, which both parties argued means that the federal Bureau of Prisons should have decided the issue. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court held:<blockquote>The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 addresses the concurrent-vs.-consecutive decision, but not the situation here. ... This does not mean, as Setser and the Government claim, that the District Court lacked authority to act as it did. ... [I]t is more natural to read &#167;3584(a) as leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in situations not covered than it is to read &#167;3621(b) as giving the Bureau [of Prisons] what amounts to sentencing authority.</blockquote>The judgment reversed a decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/United_States_v_Setser_607_F3d_128_5th_Cir_2010_Court_Opinion">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that the district court had authority to order a sentence consecutive to an anticipated state sentence, and that Setser's sentence was reasonable, even if the state court's decision made it unclear exactly how to administer it. Justice Stephen Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy.

<p>The court <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-federal-sentencing-government-liability-for-emotional-damages-under.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in the case in December. Interestingly, the government had conceded the issue and argued on behalf of petitioner that the federal judge exceeded his authority by making the consecutive/concurrent decision in the absence of a state sentence. Rather, that decision would lie with the federal Bureau of Prisons, which would consider several factors including a recommendation from the sentencing judge. Appointed counsel arguing in support of the Fifth Circuit opinion argued that &#167; 3584, which instructs when sentences ought or ought not be consecutive or concurrent, did not address the situation at bar, and therefore the federal judiciary retained its inherent power to sentence, including discretion to make the sentence run concurrently or not.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontsupremecourtcontemplation.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif " border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday heard the final day of arguments on the constitutionality of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.3590:">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (PPACA) [text; JURIST <a href="/feature/featured/health-care-reform/">backgrounder</a>] in the case of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-398-Tuesday.pdf">United States Department of Health and Human Services v. Florida</a> [transcript; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/supreme-court-to-rule-on-health-care-reform-law.php">report</a>]. In the morning the court heard arguments on the issue of <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-393.pdf">whether the "individual mandate" can be severed</a> [transcript, PDF] from the rest of the PPACA if the mandate is deemed unconstitutional. Washington attorney Paul Clement opened with arguments for the challengers, claiming that the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5000A">individual mandate</a> [text] is the heart of the statute and that, if you take it out, there is a chain of provisions that would no longer be workable with the goals of the legislation, and as such the court would have to strike down the entire PPACA. Clement argued for an "objective test" that would have the court determine whether the legislation can function the way Congress intended. He went on to claim that the text of the act and Congress' own findings state that the individual mandate is fundamental to key provisions essential to Congress' intended manner of operation. Clement also listed a chain of other provisions that would be fundamentally changed, such as the community rating and guarantee-issue provisions, which are essential to making the insurance exchanges work, which are essential to the tax credits, which are essential to policy prices on the exchanges, and so on. In the end Clement argued if the individual mandate is taken out, all that is left of the PPACA is a "hollowed-out shell" of what Congress passed, requiring the PPACA to be struck down in its entirety. Senior Deputy Solicitor General <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202546190956">Ed Kneedler</a> [<em>National Law Journal</em> report] argued for the government that the whole PPACA does not need to be struck down if the individual mandate alone is found to be unconstitutional. Kneedler agreed that the individual mandate is essential to the community rating and guaranteed-issue provisions, which should be struck down if the mandate is struck down. He argued, however, that the rest of the PPACA is severable from that package of provisions, and that the legislation can still accomplish Congress's goal of protecting patients. He argued that the aim of those other provisions was to reduce costs across the board, but that without them there are many other provisions, such as tax incentives for employers and an expansion of Medicaid, which still perform the function of increasing access to affordable care. Finally the court heard from court-appointed attorney <a href="http://www.martindale.com/H-Bartow-Farr-III/372199-lawyer.htm">H. Bartow Farr III</a> [corporate profile], who argued on behalf of amicus parties that the individual mandate is severable from even the community rating and guaranteed-issue provisions, and that if the individual mandate is held to be unconstitutional, there is no need to strike down more than that one provision. He argued that the mandate was only one solution that was enacted to reduce costs of adverse selection resulting from the other provisions, and that those sections will still serve that purpose. Farr also argued that subsidies would be lowered because people will be able to opt out of the system altogether.

<p>In the afternoon the court heard arguments on whether the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-400.pdf">expansion of the Medicaid program</a> [transcript, PDF] under the PPACA amounts to unconstitutional coercion of the states by the federal government. Clement argued that the federal government's offering incentives for a state's voluntary participation in the act's Medicaid expansion is coercive and violates states' rights on federalism grounds. Clement claimed that this dolling out of Medicaid funds is different from previous distributions in that, unlike in previous situations, coverage of newly eligible individuals is not voluntary. He also asserted that, under the PPACA, the government will have the power to take away any funds it sees as reasonably related to a state's non-participation, and that this power could be abused to take away funds on which the state has relied in the past. Such a scenario would be unconstitutional because Congress cannot accomplish its goals by coercing states through its Article I <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/spending_power">spending power</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder]. Clement also argued that the Medicaid expansion's tie to the non-voluntary individual mandate makes it coercive to states that would choose to not participate. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli again argued for the US, pointing out that the government has always had the power to amend the Medicaid program, something the states have always known. Verrilli further argued that the PPACA's new regulation does not amount to coercion, as the states would not lose more than is reasonably related to the new conditions of the health care law. He claimed that coercion is about "what you stand to lose rather than what you stand to gain"&#8212;a counter to Clement's argument that the extraordinary amount of funds offered, between 10 and 40 per cent of states' annual budgets, is one reason for why the Medicaid expansion is coercive. The Supreme Court will now discuss and make a final decision on the issue. In complicated cases, the court usually does not issue a decision until the end of its session in June.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Holder</a> [JURIST report] that the <a href ="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:H.R.3610:">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act</a> (IIRIRA) [text], a law designed to deny re-entry to immigrants who have committed certain crimes, cannot be applied retroactively to lawful immigrants if the date of his/her conviction occurred before the IIRIRA passed. The IIRIRA made it legal to deny a permanent resident reentry if he has committed a crime of "moral turpitude" in the past. The court held that under the "entry" standard of <a href = "http://supreme.justia.com/us/374/449/case.html">Rosenberg v. Fleuti</a> [opinion text], which was previously the primary standard for immigration re-entry, that a permanent legal resident can make "innocent, casual, and brief" trips abroad without being denied re-entry if the law did not exist when they were convicted of the crime. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority:<blockquote>Vartelas presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle. Neither his sentence, nor the immigration law in effect when he was convicted and sentenced, blocked him from occasional visits to his parents in Greece. Current [the IIRIRA], if applied to him, would thus attach "a new disability" to conduct over and done well before the provision's enactment. Beyond genuine doubt, we note, the restraint [the IIRIRA] places on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas ranks as a "new disability." Once able to journey abroad to fulfill religious obligations, attend funerals and weddings of family members, tend to vital financial interests, or respond to family emergencies, permanent residents situated as Vartelas is now face potential banishment. We have several times recognized the severity of that sanction.</blockquote>Justice Antonin Scalia led the dissent, which argued that the court should have deferred to not applying a statute retroactively only under rare circumstances: "In determining whether a statute applies retroactively, we should concern ourselves with the statute's actual operation on regulated parties, not with retroactivity as an abstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns."

<p>Panagis Vartelas, a lawful resident in the US for 24 years, pleaded guilty to a crime before the law was ratified and then left the US briefly and was denied reentry. JURIST Guest Columnists <a href="http://www.kkwtlaw.com/Bio/IraKurzban.asp">Ira Kurzban</a> and Christopher Rickerd of <a href="http://www.kkwtlaw.com/">Kurzban Kurzban Weinger Tetzeli &#38; Pratt P.A.</a> argued that the Supreme Court should not retroactively apply certain immigration laws when deciding <span class = "casename">Vartelas</span> in <A href = "/sidebar/2012/02/kurzban-rickerd-iirira-retroactive.php">Retroactive Application of Immigration Law is Impermissible</a> [JURIST comment]. They agreed with the majority that retroactive application was inappropriate because such a ruling would impose a new disability on the settled expectation of free travel by lawfully permanent residents. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Using a <a href = "http://www.foia.gov/">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) [official website] lawsuit, the ACLU discovered that the FBI had been using the program to record conversations, observe behavior and collect data within mosques in California. The ACLU is alleging a violation of First Amendment rights to freedom of religion as well as the <a href = "http://www.justice.gov/opcl/privstat.htm">Privacy Act of 1974</a> [text].<blockquote>Almost every FBI memorandum described above was labeled "positive intelligence," which means the information in it would be uploaded and retained in FBI intelligence files. Categorizing information about religious beliefs, practices, and otherwise innocent activities as "positive intelligence" could have very serious negative consequences for Muslim groups and their congregants. FBI agents accessing this information in intelligence files would assume it was relevant to the FBI's investigative and intelligence mission, casting a cloud of suspicion over the group or individual mentioned and potentially leading to more intensive scrutiny or investigation. The dissemination of this "positive intelligence" outside the FBI would only increase the likelihood that other law enforcement or intelligence agencies would investigate innocent groups or individuals based solely on their religion. Freedom of religion is a foundational element of American democracy, guaranteed by the First Amendment to our Constitution. In order to protect Americans' religious freedom and other First Amendment rights, Congress passed the Privacy Act of 1974, which prohibits the government from collecting or retaining information about individuals' First Amendment activities in all but very limited circumstances. The FBI's documents demonstrate that it is ignoring these mandates and is misusing outreach to mosques and religious organizations to collect intelligence on American Muslims' religious beliefs and activities. The FBI's conduct, exposed in its own documents, threatens to chill American Muslims' religious rights, exploits the good faith of Muslim groups and their members, and undermines community support for the government's legitimate community outreach efforts.</blockquote>A representative for the FBI <a href = "http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-fbi-california-mosques-20120328,0,6306491.story">defended its actions</a> [LAT report] in a statement. The information recorded appears to be observations of cultural and religious traditions, but names of attendants of the mosques are filed in the FBI, as are transcripts of private conversations. The ACLU urged the FBI to stop masquerading information-gathering as outreach and did not suggest that further legal action will be taken.

<p>The FBI has come under controversy for its investigation of Muslims in the US before. US Attorney General Eric Holder in August <a href = "/paperchase/2011/08/us-ag-holder-invokes-state-secrets-privilege-in-mosque-surveillance-lawsuit.php">invoked the state secrets privilege</a> [JURIST report] to block evidence in a lawsuit against the FBI over its investigation into Muslim mosques. The Department of Justice also filed a motion to dismiss claims and for summary judgment contending that without such privileged information many of the claims against the FBI could not continue. The ACLU and the Council on American-Islamic Relations of California brought a lawsuit on behalf of three Muslim individuals in California against the FBI alleging that during its "Operation Flex," FBI investigators infiltrated mosques and indiscriminately collected information on innocent Muslims simply because they were Muslim. In 2009, FBI Director Robert Mueller said the <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/fbi-head-defends-mosque-investigations.php">FBI will continue investigating mosques</a> [JURIST report] when there may be evidence or information regarding criminal wrongdoings after the Council of Islamic Organizations of Michigan sent a complaint to Holder alleging the FBI had been asking members of the Islamic community to spy on religious leaders and followers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Court held that the 2010 Ultrasound Act is unconstitutional and unenforceable under the Oklahoma Constitution. The court ultimately amended a <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/oklahoma-court-blocks-requiring-pre-abortion-ultrasounds.php">temporary injunction issued in 2010</a> [JURIST report] to a permanent injunction, disallowing the enforcement of the Act. After the order was handed down, Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a> [official website], the party <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/Petition.pdf">challenging</a> [petition, PDF] the law, <a href="http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/court-permanently-blocks-oklahomas-demeaning-and-intrusive-anti-abortion-ultrasound-law">praised the court's decision</a> [press release]:<blockquote>The court has resoundingly affirmed what should not be a matter of controversy at all&#8212;that women have both a fundamental right to make their own choices about their reproductive health, and that government has no place in their decisions. Today's decision adds to the growing momentum of a nationwide backlash against the overreaching of lawmakers hostile to women, their doctors, and their rights.</blockquote>The lawsuit argued that the Act violates physicians' rights to equal protection of the law and freedom of speech, while discounting a woman's ability to make decisions about her pregnancy. 

<p>This decision comes at the heels of other state legislatures reviewing similar matters. Last month, the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/politics/upload/2012/02/judge_dismisses_sonogram_lawsu/Sonogram%20Sparks%20order.pdf">ruled</a> [order, PDF] that <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-law.php">Texas can begin enforcing</a> [JURIST report] a state law that requires women to have a sonogram before undergoing an abortion. Also last month, the Virginia Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-senate-approves-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would require women seeking abortions to have transabdominal ultrasounds before the procedure, and require a doctor to inform a woman of the gestational age and development of the fetus. In October, a judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] issued a <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/federal-judge-blocks-ultrasound-provision-of-north-carolina-abortion-law.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report], blocking part of the state's abortion law that required a physician to perform an ultrasound and describe the images to the patient. In March 2010 the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm">Supreme Court of Oklahoma</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/oklahoma-supreme-court-rejects-broad.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a <a href="http://webserver1.lsb.state.ok.us/2007-08bills/HB/SB1878_hflr.rtf">state law</a> [SB 1878 text, RFT] imposing broad restrictions on abortion, including the requirement of an ultrasound one hour prior to the procedure, violated that state's constitution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In a statement read on Mali state television, it was announced that the new constitution will allow citizens to demonstrate or go on strike and that it will provide immunity to the leaders of the military coup. The announcement comes after the <a href="http://ecowas.int/">Economic Community of West African States</a> [official website] announced it would <a href="http://news.ecowas.int/presseshow.php?nb=084&lang=en&annee=2012">send a delegation into Mali</a> [press release] to "secure the speedy restoration of constitutional order in the country." The country's new leaders also announced that they plan to hold elections, although they did not announce an election date. Under the new constitution, the leaders of the coup that toppled <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/20123229824215677.html">President Amadou Toumani Toure</a> [Al Jazeera profile] would not be eligible to run for elected office.

<p>Mali has experienced military turmoil since <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2008/03/200852512619630569.html">Taureg rebels began attacking Malian soldiers</a> [Al Jazeera report] in January. Earlier this week, the acting head of the EU delegation in Mali, Bertrand Soret, <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/eu-un-security-council-call-for-restoration-of-constitution-in-mali.php">met with the leader of the coup</a> [JURIST report] urging a quick return to constitutional order in the country. Early this month, the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) [official website] said that <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&docid=4f50c7316&query=mali">more than 80,000 people had fled Mali</a> [press release] to escape the fighting.

AI claims that discriminatory practices and harsh policies responding to immigration by US officials results in the deaths of hundreds each year, and that as many as 5,287 died crossing the border between 1998 and 2008. In a <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/usa-in-hostile-terrain-human-rights-violations-in-immigration-enforcement-in-the-us-southwest">release</a> [group news article] accompanying the report, the group said that the US is "failing in its obligations under international law to ensure" human rights to illegal immigrants within its borders. The report is critical of both federal policy and enforcement as well as those of border states, particularly Texas and Arizona. AI enumerated the responsibilities the US has under international law with respect to immigration:<blockquote>The US government has an obligation under international human rights law to ensure that its laws, policies and practices do not place immigrants at an increased risk of human rights abuses. This includes acting with due diligence to investigate and punish criminal conduct, such as domestic violence or human trafficking, committed by private individuals, and guaranteeing access to justice for immigrant victims of crime.</blockquote> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dhs.gov/index.shtm">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] spokesman Matt Chandler <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-usa-border-rights-idUSBRE82R0TJ20120328">responded to the report</a> [Reuters report] by claiming that AI was basing its report on "outdated information or anonymous anecdotes" and further criticized it as not offering "actionable recommendations for improvement." AI recommends that all immigration enforcement programs should be suspended until a review can be conducted by the DHS Inspector General.

<p>The report comes as a general movement has been sweeping the country toward tougher enforcement of immigration policy.  The trend began with a controversial law in <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=arizona+immigration">Arizona</a> [JURIST news archive], and similar legislation has passed in <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/utah-legislature-approves-new-version-of-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Utah</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/south-carolina-lawmakers-approve-arizona-style-immigration-legislation.php">South Carolina</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/indiana-house-approves-arizona-style-immigration-bill.php">Indiana</a> [JURIST reports]. In December the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari</em> to determine whether Arizona's controversial immigration law is <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/supreme-court-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-challenge.php">preempted by federal law</a> [JURIST report]. In November the US <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/doj-urges-supreme-court-not-to-hear-arizona-immigration-law-appeal.php">urged the Supreme Court not to hear Arizona's appeal</a> [JURIST report]. The Supreme Court in May ruled in <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-115.ZS.html">Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] that Arizona's controversial employment-related <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-upholds-arizona-immigration-employment-law.php">immigration law is not preempted</a> [JURIST report] by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontrussia2.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The Russian lower house of Parliament, the <a href="http://duma.ru/">State Duma</a> [website], will consider a controversial bill introduced by lawmakers on Thursday that bans the spread of "homosexual propaganda" to minors. The bill <a href="http://www.times-standard.com/ci_20280769/russias-duma-consider-gay-propaganda-bill">calls for fines</a> [AP report] of up to 500,000 rubles (USD $16,500) for promoting the homosexual lifestyle and appears to be aimed at media outlets which lawmakers blame for "promoting gay lifestyles as 'normal behavior.'" The bill is similar to a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-city-law-bans-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">bill signed into law</a> [JURIST report] early this month in St. Petersburg that imposes fines against people convicted of promoting homosexuality, including gays or lesbians who are open about their sexuality. The St. Petersburg <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/russia-lawmakers-approve-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">bill was introduced in November</a> [JURIST report], and sponsors claim it is necessary because <a href="http://en.ria.ru/analysis/20111118/168818571.html">homosexual propaganda "threatens" Russia</a> [RIA Novosti report] and that "sexual deviation" negatively impacts Russian children. Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called on Governor Georgy Poltavchenko to <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/02/russia-block-st-petersburg-s-homophobic-law">veto the St. Petersburg legislation</a> [news release], which they called a "discriminatory and dangerous initiative." The new bill also calls for fines of up to 1 million rubles for promotion of pedophilia.

<p>Russia has long struggled with the acceptance of homosexuality. In 2008, several <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/moscow-gay-pride-advocates-arrested-for.php">Russian gay rights activists were arrested</a> [JURIST report] by police in Moscow for holding events commemorating the 1993 law that put an end to government prosecution for homosexual activity in Russia. It was the third consecutive year Moscow Pride held events around the city to elude officials attempting to <a href="/paperchase/2006/05/moscow-court-bans-gay-pride-parade.php">enforce a local ban on gay pride parades</a> [JURIST report] that was put in place due to fears of violence. The UN has attempted to pass resolutions aimed at ending sexuality discrimination worldwide but has faced difficulty passing resolutions on gay rights issues. Last year the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] passed the <a href="http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=A/HRC/RES/17/19&Lang=E">"Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity" resolution</a> [text, PDF], which is the first resolution to <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/un-rights-council-passes-first-gay-rights-resolution.php">call for an end to sexuality discrimination worldwide</a> [JURIST report]. In 2010 <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] called for countries around the world to <a href="/paperchase/2010/09/un-sg-urges-abolishment-of-anti-gay-laws.php">abolish laws discriminating against gay and lesbian individuals</a> [JURIST report]. A year earlier, the UN <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/obama-to-sign-un-gay-rights-declaration.php">passed a gay rights declaration</a> [JURIST report] calling on states to end criminalization and persecution of homosexuals. This declaration was recalled by the new resolution. Although <a href="http://geneva.usmission.gov/2011/03/22/lgbtrights/">85 countries signed the declaration</a> [US Ambassador statement], 57 countries, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, signed an opposing statement. In 2008, the <a href="http://www.un.org/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website] was divided over the <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/un-general-assembly-divided-over-gay.php">issue of decriminalizing homosexuality</a> [JURIST report] as 66 nations signed a statement calling for decriminalization, and nearly 60 nations signed an opposing statement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Harris <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/blagojevich-aide-pleads-guilty-to-wire.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to a single count of wire fraud in 2009 after <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE5676MI20090708">agreeing to testify</a> [Reuters report] against Blagojevich and four other defendants. Blagojevich was <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-sentenced-to-14-years.php">sentenced to 14 years in prison</a> in December after he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/Illinois-ex-governor-blagojevich-convicted-on-corruption-charges.php">convicted</a> [JURIST reports] of 18 counts of corruption earlier last year.

The proposed law would allow the state to issue cards to patients with illnesses such as cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, MS and others. A prospective recipient of a card would be required to get consent from a doctor and undergo a full medical history to prove the existence of one of the stipulated conditions. The legislation would also require an ongoing doctor-patient relationship with the prescribing physician. The locations where the patient can use the drug would also be limited. The bill essentially would protect cardholders from prosecution, while allowing them to grow up to four marijuana plants in a secure location, under the control and oversight of the <a href="http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> [official website]. One of the bill's co-sponsors in the House is Representative is <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/member.aspx?member=376673">Evalyn Merrick</a> [official profile], a cancer survivor who sponsored a <a href="http://e-lobbyist.com/gaits/view/247329">similar bill</a> [HB 442 materials] in 2011. That legislation died in the Senate. Previous bills have also met with gubernatorial opposition. A 2009 bill passed both houses but was vetoed by the governor, and the Senate could not get enough votes to override the veto. 

<p>In 2010 New Jersey became the fourteenth US state to legalize medical marijuana. In November 2009 voters in Maine <a href="/paperchase/2009/11/maine-voters-approve-expansion-of.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an <a href="http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/medicalmarijuanaact.pdf">expansion</a> [proposed legislation, PDF] of the state's existing medical marijuana laws, making Maine the fifth state to allow dispensaries, following California, Colorado, Rhode Island, and New Mexico. In October 2009 US Attorney General Eric Holder issued <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/doj-directs-prosecutors-to-end-raids-on.php">guidelines for a new policy</a> [JURIST report] for investigating and prosecuting state-sanctioned medical marijuana use. Those guidelines reflect a pledge made by Holder in March 2009 to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/doj-to-end-raids-on-medical-marijuana.php">stop federal raids</a> [JURIST report] on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state laws. Ending such raids was one of President Barack Obama's <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/politics/primarysource/2007/08/all_democratic.html">campaign promises</a> [<em>Boston Globe</em> report], a view that differed sharply from the policy of the Bush administration. However, earlier this month a federal judge ruled that medical marijuana providers were <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-rules-california-medical-marijuana-providers-not-shielded-from-federal-prosecution.php">not exempt from prosecution</a> [JURIST report] by federal authorities. </p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/case-dossier/cms-sgd/dock-regi-eng.aspx?cas=34402">complaint</a> [case information] was filed by University of Ottawa law professor <a href="http://www.commonlaw.uottawa.ca/index.php?option=com_contact&task=view&contact_id=28&Itemid=26">Amir Attaran</a> [faculty profile], whose previous research uncovered a pattern of suspicious injuries on three detainees captured in April 2006 and later released. Attaran was <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/court+blocks+government+effort+restrict+Afghan+human+rights+info/6379200/story.html">originally granted permission</a> [<em>Ottawa Citizen</em> report] to view the documents with significant portions blacked out. A Court of Appeals ordered the government to provide a more complete version of the documents in May 2011. Thursday's decision denied the government's final appeal, and Attaran is expected to receive a new version of the documents. 

<p>The Canadian <a href="http://www.mpcc-cppm.gc.ca/index-eng.aspx">Military Police Complaints Commission</a> (MPCC) [official website] released a report in 2009 concluding that three Afghan detainees <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/canada-commission-concludes-afghan.php">were not mistreated</a> while in Canadian military police custody in Kandahar in 2006. The probe began following a civilian complaint filed by Attaran. The Canadian government <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/canada-to-investigate-afghan-detainee.php">ordered the inquiry</a> [JURIST report] in February 2007. There are ongoing investigations into <a href="/paperchase/2007/02/canada-afghanistan-detainee-agreement.php">complaints</a> [JURIST report] filed by <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/canada">Amnesty International Canada</a> (AIC) and the <a href="http://www.bccla.org/">British Columbia Civil Liberties Association</a> (BCCLA) [advocacy websites]. Following public outcry, Canada <a href="/paperchase/2007/05/canada-signs-new-detainee-transfer.php">signed a new agreement regarding detainee transfers</a> [JURIST report] with the Afghan government in May 2007, giving Canada the right to inspect detainees following their transfer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><img src="/topstoryphoto/frontkansas.jpg" alt="Photo source or description" valign="top" align="left" border="1" hspace="0" vspace="4"></td><td><img src="/images/s.gif" border="0" height="1" width="5"></td></tr></tbody></table>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/">Kansas House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved a <a href="http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2011_12/measures/documents/hb2384_00_0000.pdf">bill</a> [HB 2384; PDF] Wednesday that prohibits a governing body from passing a law that would infringe on an individual's right to religion, which some suggest is a guise to discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill is commonly known as Kansas Preservation of Religious Freedom Act and passed the house by a <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2012/03/29/3521591/kansas-house-tentatively-limits.html">vote of 89-27</a> [Kansas City Star report]. It focuses on a Kansas citizen's <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/First_amendment">First Amendment</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder] rights and states that in exercising free religion a person has the "right to act or refuse to act in a manner substantially motivated by a sincerely-held religious tenant or belief, whether or not the exercise is compulsory or a central requirement of the person's religious tenants or beliefs." The bill goes on to afford a person whose right has been burdened&#8212;or will likely be burdened&#8212;to assert such violation as a claim or defense in a court of law. The main controversy surrounding the bill concerns its effect on anti-discrimination laws and policies. Supporters say the bill will not prevent local governing bodies to add classes of individuals to anti-discrimination policies, but it would enable a defense for those who felt their freedoms of speech or religion were in question. Opponents of the bill say it is a way to discriminate, specifically against same-sex couples, while claiming freedom of religion as an excuse. They suggest that the bill will <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/03/29/454605/kansas-house-advances-religious-license-to-discriminate-legislation/?mobile=nc">prevent municipalities from establishing protections</a> [Think Progress report] based on sexual orientation while simultaneously giving others the right to discriminate. Some supporters admit it would be difficult to add a class of individuals to anti-discrimination policies. The bill will now be sent to the Senate, but whether or not it will pass the Senate is unclear.

<p>Protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals remains a political issue that many are deeply divided on. In November, Massachusetts passed an <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/massachusetts-passes-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill.php">anti-discrimination bill</a> [JURIST report] that would protect people in the areas of housing and the workplace. Connecticut <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/connecticut-passes-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill.php">passed similar legislation</a> [JURIST report] in June, defining "gender identity or expression" and providing protection in the state's existing anti-discrimination laws. Other national action includes measures to stop hate crimes against LGBT individuals. In March, US <a href="http://polis.house.gov/">Representative Jared Polis</a> (D-CO) and <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Al Franken</a> (D-MN) [official websites] introduced legislation to <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/us-legislators-introduce-bill-ending-bullying-in-federally-funded-schools.php">protect LGBT students from bullying</a> [JURIST report] in federally funded public elementary and high schools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Relying on the findings of fact from <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2001cv2094-229">Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran</a> (Peterson II) [opinion, PDF], Judge Royce Lamberth, Chief Judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/dcd/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website], found that marines Jeffrey Paul O'Brien and Daniel Lane Gaffney had already proven that Iran's acts of extrajudicial killing and support for such killing were intended to cause their injuries, thus they were entitled to collect damages under the <a href="http://www.uchastings.edu/faculty-administration/faculty/paul/class-website/docs/ForeignSovereignImmunitiesAct.pdf">Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act</a> [text], 28 USC &#167; 1605A(c), for solatium and pain and suffering. In his conclusion, Lamberth reasoned:<blockquote>[T]he Court applauds plaintiffs' persistent efforts to hold Iran accountable for its cowardly support of terrorism. The Court concludes that defendant Iran must be punished to the fullest extent legally possible for the bombing in Beirut on October 23, 1983. This horrific act impacted countless individuals and their families, a number of whom receive awards in this lawsuit. This Court hopes that the victims and their families may find some measure of solace from this Court's final judgment.</blockquote>Collection of the award may be difficult, though plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Peter Drennan is hopeful that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/judge-awards-44-million-to-victims-of-83-attack-in-beirut-but-money-will-be-hard-to-collect/2012/03/28/gIQA9ZRUhS_story.html">judgment will be enforced</a> [AP report] against blocked Iranian assets in the US.

<p>In September 2007 <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/iran-rejects-us-court-ruling-on-1983.php">Iran dismissed a ruling</a> made by Lamberth only two days earlier that <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/us-judge-fines-iran-265b-for-1983.php">required Iran to compensate</a> [JURIST reports] the families of 241 US military personnel killed in the 1983 bombing of US Marine barracks in Beirut. There, Iran called the $2.65 billion US ruling "baseless" and "politically motivated," as it was the largest judgment ever awarded by a US court against a foreign country. While Iran has consistently been accused of supporting <a href="http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155">Hezbollah</a> [CFR backgrounder], the militant group behind the bombing, the Islamic Republic has denied responsibility.

In particular, HRW called for the release of about 400 women and girls jailed because of these crimes and also urged the US and other donor countries to pressure <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3135938.stm">President Hamid Karzai</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=karzai">news archive</a>] to "end the wrongful imprisonment of women and girls who are crime victims rather than criminals." The plea stems from a comprehensive HRW report titled <a href="http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/afghanistan0312webwcover_0.pdf">"I Had to Run Away": Women and Girls Imprisoned for "Moral Crimes" in Afghanistan</a> [text, PDF], which is based on nearly 60 interviews with "moral crime" convicts and was conducted in three prisons and three detention facilities.

<p>HRW has previously called on the Afghan government to protect the rights of women. In July 2010 the advocacy group <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/afghanistan-government-must-protect-women's-rights-during-reconciliation-efforts:-hrw.php">criticized Karzai's integration and reconciliation efforts</a> [JURIST report] to end the conflict with the Taliban and other insurgent groups, claiming that women's rights were bypassed in order to reach an expedient solution. Among HRW's criticisms was the president's decision to <a href="/paperchase/2009/03/afghanistan-president-signs-law.php">sign the Shia Personal Status Law</a> [JURIST report; <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4a24ed5b2.pdf">text</a>, PDF], which legalized rape within marriage, and his pardon of two convicted rapists. In August <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/amended-afghanistan-personal-status-law.php">HRW denounced the Shia Personal Status Law</a> [JURIST report] as a violation of the <a href="http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html">Afghan Constitution</a> [text] that undermined women's rights, despite an announcement in July 2009 that the provisions requiring a wife to submit to sex with her husband and to obtain his permission before leaving the home had been <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/afghanistan-revises-marital-sex.php">removed</a> [JURIST report]. Women's rights in Afghanistan faced even greater opposition under the Taliban, which ruled the country from 1996-2001.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Our spring fund drive ends tomorrow! Our annual goal is $30,000, and as of this posting we have just about hit the 25% mark. Your response has been phenomenal, but another $1,500 means we'll be 30% funded for the coming year. . .another $2,500 and we'll be 33% funded. . .and with another 7 donors, we will go over the century mark in the number of people who have contributed. Help make it happen!

<p>As previously mentioned, due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donating to JURIST</a>. Even if you are not in a position to give much, please keep in mind that small donations - $25, or even $10 - can go a long way. One of JURIST's strengths is in the number of people it touches every day, from readers to staff to alumni. If everyone of those people could give just a small amount, JURIST would never have to worry about funding again. We know that not everyone is in a position to give, but if you can, even a small amount can make a big difference. For those of you that are able to give more, please know that JURIST will recognize all donors that give $100 or more on its website at <a href="/supportjurist/honorroll.php">jurist.org/supportjurist/honorroll.php</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was charged with violating laws regulating tenders and auctions including profiteering, illegal seizure of state land and squandering public funds. During his term from 1993 to 2005, Soliman was involved in corrupt land deals with various private entities, two of which were involved in the present case. In the first case, Soliman and <a href="http://www.marefa.org/index.php/%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A_%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AE">Magdi Rasekh</a> [Al-Ma'rifa profile, in Arabic], former chairman of <a href="http://www.sodic.com/">Six of October Development &#38; Investment Company</a> (SODIC) [corporate website] and father-in-law of ex-president Hosni Mubarak's son Alaa Mubarak, were sentenced to five years for profiteering, squandering public funds and illegal acquisition of state land. The court also ordered them to repay 81 million Egyptian pounds that they received from the corrupt land deals and a fine equal to that amount. In the second case Soliman assigned residential land belonging to the ministry to Komi and Hazeq, businessmen, at a price lower than the market value. Soliman was charged with illegal acquisition of state land and squandering public funds, sentenced to three years of imprisonment and ordered to repay 34 million Egyptian pounds plus a fine equal to that amount. Additional defendants were sentenced on Thursday including Ezzat Abdel Raouf Abdel Qader, former head of the New Urban Communities for Real Estate and Commercial Affairs Sector, and Fouad Madbouli, Hassan Khaled Fadel and Mohamed Ahmed Abdel Dayem, former General Authority for Urban Communities officials. In total the defendants are responsible to a fine of around 2 billion Egyptian pounds ($330 million).

<p>Corruption has been an ongoing problem for the Egyptian government. In November <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Right Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/10/egypt-political-corruption-law-amendments-have-potential-for-abuse-hrw.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Egypt's attempt to deal with corruption because the new law to be implemented would allow authorities to imprison anyone convicted of crimes involving "political corruption," which the organization alleges are vaguely defined, as well as deprive convicted persons of their rights to vote and run for office. In September an Egyptian criminal court <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/egypt-court-sentences-former-mubarak-associates-on-corruption-charges.php">sentenced three associates</a> [JURIST report] of Mubarak on charges of corruption including illegally manipulating state-owned businesses, granting licenses without merit, misusing public funds and profiteering. In the same month, the former tourism minister <a href="/paperchase/2011/09/egypt-court-convicts-former-mubarak-regime-leader-in-corruption-case.php">was found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of corruption charges. In July, another Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/egypt-court-convicts-ex-pm-of-corruption.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] former prime minister Ahmed Nazif and two Cabinet officials of corruption and sentenced them to various prison terms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Al-Khawaja, a Danish citizen, former protection coordinator with <a href="http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/">Front Line Defenders</a> [advocacy website] and leading Bahraini human rights defender, was arrested for leading protests against the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Bahrain">Bahraini government</a> [JURIST news archive]. AI said that Al-Khawaja was sentenced without a fair trial and was <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/rights-group-urges-bahrain-torture-investigation.php">subject to torture and ill-treatment</a> [JURIST report] while in custody. However, no investigation to verify such ill-treatment has been initiated. The organization stressed that Al-Khawaja is a "prisoner of conscience" who led a peaceful demonstration which did not advocate violence against the government. Considering this contention and Bahrain's promise to release those who were jailed during the revolt, AI called on the government to release Al-Khawaja immediately:<blockquote>Bahrain must ensure that Al-Khawaja is released immediately and unconditionally. The Bahraini authorities have made pledges that they would release people who were imprisoned for exercising their right to freedom of expression, but the continued imprisonment of Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja demonstrates that they are not serious about fulfilling such promises.</blockquote> Al-Khawaja began his hunger strike on February 8 and several parties, including Danish diplomats, confirmed his deteriorating health. His sentence, which was affirmed in September by the National Safety Court of Appeal, also a military court, is now on appeal and a hearing before the Court of Cassation will take place on April 2.

<p>The Bahraini government has been subject to numerous criticisms for its use of excessive force against citizen protesters. In early March, based on a report of excessive force by Bahraini security forces, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-rights-office-concerned-over-bahrain-violence.php">called on the government</a> [JURIST report] to investigate the allegations. During that same month, <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a report, similar to a <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/bahrain-committed-human-rights-violations-according-to-independent-commission-report.php">report</a> [JURIST report] released in November by the <a href="http://www.bici.org.bh/">Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry</a> (BICI) [official website] about human rights violations against demonstrators, alleging that Bahrain is <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/hrw-report-bahrain-convicting-hundreds-in-unfair-trials.php">convicting hundreds of opposition activists</a> [JURIST report] in unfair and politically motivated trials. In February, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Navi Pillay</a> [official profile] also urged the Bahraini government to <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/un-commissioner-urges-bahrain-to-respect-rights-of-demonstrators.php">respect protesters' rights</a> [JURIST report] and stressed that excessive use of force by the government against civilian demonstrators is strictly forbidden in international law. Pillay made a similar call to the government in December when she said that protesters who were detained during peaceful protests <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/un-rights-chief-bahrain-government-should-release-protestors-rebuild-trust.php">should be released</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

The amendment would confer "personhood" rights to embryos at the "beginning of biological development." If the initiative passes, it would effectively outlaw all abortions, many forms of birth control, and many essential treatments for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages. The lawsuit claims that the amendment would violate the Fourteenth Amendment and, as such, should not be allowed to be put on the ballot. The complaint states:<blockquote>The amendment to the Oklahoma Constitution proposed by [the initiative] is intended to, and will, ban abortion in direct violation of both the federal Constitution and this Court's clear declaration the Oklahoma's initiative process may not be invoked for that purpose. Further, it would infringe on a woman's federal constitutional right to decide whether and when to conceive by banning most forms of contraception and effectively prohibiting medical interventions, like in vitro fertilization, that assist with conception.</blockquote><a href="http://www.personhoodusa.com/">Personhood USA</a> [advocacy website] released a statement <a href="http://www.personhoodusa.com/press-release/opponents-file-suit-challenging-personhood-oklahoma%E2%80%99s-pro-life-amendment-petition">condemning the lawsuit</a> [press release].

<p>The Virginia House of Delegates <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/virginia-house-of-delegates-approves-personhood-legislation.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a similar "personhood" bill in February.

The bill, formerly titled "The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act," finds substantial medical evidence that unborn fetuses can experience pain after their 20th week, and asserts a compelling state interest to protect those unborn children. The bill is now expected to be reviewed by the <a href="http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/senate/">New Hampshire Senate</a> [official website]. This is the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2012/03/29/nh_house_votes_to_ban_abortion_after_20_weeks/">fifth vote in two weeks</a> [AP report] to place new restrictions on abortions in New Hampshire. In June 2011 New Hampshire legislators <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/new-hampshire-legislature-overrides-governors-veto-of-abortion-notification-bill.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] the governor's veto and approved legislation requiring healthcare providers to notify parents or a judge 48 hours before performing an abortion on a minor.

<p>Many states have recently passed laws restricting abortion. Earlier this week, the Arizona State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/arizona-senate-votes-to-ban-abortions-after-20-weeks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] that similarly bans abortions after 20 weeks into a pregnancy, with an exception carved out only for medical emergencies. Last week, Utah <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/utah-approves-72-hour-waiting-period-for-abortions.php">passed a law</a> [JURIST report] requiring a woman seeking an abortion to wait 72 hours prior to obtaining the procedure. Earlier last week, the Idaho State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/idaho-senate-approves-abortion-ultrasound-bill.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring a woman who is seeking an abortion to first receive an ultrasound. Earlier this month, Virginia <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Bob McDonnell</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/virginia-governor-signs-bill-requiring-ultrasound-before-abortion.php">signed a similar ultrasound bill into law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in March, the Georgia House of Representatives passed a ban on abortions after <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/georgia-house-passes-ban-on-late-term-abortions.php">five months into a pregnancy</a> [JURIST report]. In February, the <a href="http://www.txwd.uscourts.gov/default1.asp">US District Court for the Western District of Texas</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/federal-judge-allows-enforcement-of-texas-abortion-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Texas can enforce a state law requiring women to receive a sonogram before obtaining an abortion. In July, the North Carolina state legislature <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/north-carolina-senate-overrides-veto-on-abortion-waiting-period-bill.php">overrode a governor's veto</a> [JURIST report] to pass a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period for a woman seeking an abortion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Judge Ernest Canellos ruled that the university's warning system did not violate the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1092">Clery Act</a> [text], which sets regulations on how and when schools are required to warn students regarding potential threats. At issue was the timing of the warning e-mail sent out by the university. The warning was sent to students after the shooter had already began shooting, but the warning e-mail said nothing about actual shootings and mentioned only the possibility that a shooting incident had occurred. Virginia Tech administrators were <a href="http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2012/03/033012-president-appealruling.html">pleased with the ruling</a> [press release] and expressed hope that "lessons from this unforeseeable crime will continue to inform the practices affecting campus safety throughout the nation and the world." The ruling, subject to a potential appeal, relieves Virginia Tech of liability under the Clery Act. 

<p>The decision comes only two weeks after a jury found for families of 2 victims in a <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/virginia-found-tech-negligent-for-2007-shooting-response.php">negligence case against the Virginia Tech administration</a> [JURIST report]. Virginia Tech has faced several lawsuits over the shooting incident. Last month, a Virginia circuit court judge <a href="http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/11/judge-denies-immunity-claim-in-virginia-tech-wrongful-death-lawsuit.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the lawsuit by two families whose children were killed in the shooting could proceed against school administrators, despite their claims of sovereign immunity. The <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/families-of-virginia-tech-shooting.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report], seeking $10 million in damages, accused the administrators of gross negligence for failing to warn students of the shootings immediately after the first shooting at 7:15 AM. It was brought by two families who opted out of an <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/judge-approves-11-million-virginia-tech.php">$11 million dollar settlement</a> [JURIST report] to which 24 of the 32 victims' families agreed in June 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The new law effectively required those convicted of prostitution-like charges to register as sexual offenders while not imposing a similar requirement on persons convicted of actual prostitution charges. It targeted people who solicited oral or anal sexual acts for monetary compensation, describing these acts as "crimes against nature," while ignoring vaginal intercourse solicitation. Feldman found the law to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [Cornel LII], and thus held it to be unconstitutional.  Feldman wrote:<blockquote>First, the State has created two classifications of similarly (in fact, identical) situated individuals who were treated differently (only one class is subject to mandatory sex offender registration). Second, the classification has no rational relation to any legitimate government objective: there is no legitimating rationale in the record to justify targeting only those convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation for mandatory sex offender registration.</blockquote>The "rational basis" test employed by Feldman gives the government significant deference, but he held that this law did not meet that standard when he wrote, "the defendants fail to credibly serve up even one unique legitimating governmental interest that can rationally explain the registration requirement."

<p>US courts have seen numerous constitutional challenges to laws placing restrictions on sex offenders. In January, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-new-mexico-sex-offender-library-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a policy in the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, that bans registered sex offenders from entering the city's public libraries is unconstitutional. The American Civil Liberties filed a complaint in federal court in August seeking to block a Louisiana law that <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/aclu-seeks-to-block-louisiana-sex-offender-internet-use-law.php">limits Internet use for registered sex offenders</a> [JURIST report]. In May 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2010/05/supreme-court-upholds-law-allowing-mentally-ill-prisoners-to-be-committed-longer-than-their-sentence.php">mentally ill sex offenders may be civilly committed</a> [JURIST report] beyond their prison sentences.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Our spring fund drive ends in just a few hours! Your response has been phenomenal - we've raised 25% of our annual goal and have eclipsed 100 individual donors. Don't stop now! Another $1,500 means we'll be 30% funded for the coming year. . .another $2,500 and we'll be 33% funded. You can still make a difference. Help make it happen!

<p>As previously mentioned, due to general economic circumstances completely outside of our control, we are anticipating a significant reduction in funding (meaning several tens of thousands of dollars) from our primary benefactors for our next fiscal year. If not offset, this reduction has the potential to directly affect JURIST's ability to maintain its current operations. This fund drive is one of the efforts that we've recently launched to try to make up the shortfall.</p>

<p>Please consider <a href="/supportjurist/donate-now.php">donating to JURIST</a>. Even if you are not in a position to give much, please keep in mind that small donations - $25, or even $10 - can go a long way. One of JURIST's strengths is in the number of people it touches every day, from readers to staff to alumni. If everyone of those people could give just a small amount, JURIST would never have to worry about funding again. We know that not everyone is in a position to give, but if you can, even a small amount can make a big difference. For those of you that are able to give more, please know that JURIST will recognize all donors that give $100 or more on its website at <a href="/supportjurist/honorroll.php">jurist.org/supportjurist/honorroll.php</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you - we greatly appreciate your support!</p>]]></content:encoded>

We also urge Chile to enact hate crime legislation that establishes hatred based on various grounds, including sexual orientation and gender identity, as an aggravating factor for the purposes of criminal prosecution.</blockquote>An anti-discrimination bill is currently being reviewed and is awaiting approval by the lower House of Parliament in Chile.

<p>Discrimination because on sexual orientation has been an ongoing issue in many countries. Earlier this month the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/un-members-to-challenge-sexual-orientation-based-discrimination.php">urged member states to put an end to sexual orientation-based violence</a> [JURIST report] and discrimination. In a video address, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon acknowledged that sexual orientation and gender identity are sensitive subjects, but said action needs to be taken because lives are at stake. The Russian lower house of Parliament, the State Duma, is considering a controversial bill that <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/russia-lawmakers-introduce-bill-banning-promotion-of-homosexuality.php">bans the spread of "homosexual propaganda" to minors</a> [JURIST report]. The bill calls for fines of up to 500,000 rubles (USD $16,500) for promoting the homosexual lifestyle and appears to be aimed at media outlets which lawmakers blame for "promoting gay lifestyles as 'normal behavior.'" </p>]]></content:encoded>

An international arrest warrant for Muhayimana was issued in December after he was accused of participating in killings and other crimes against humanity. A lawyer for Muhayimana indicated that while he would be willing to stand trial in the <a href="http://www.unictr.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) [official website] or France, he does not believe he will have a fair trial in Rwanda. The French government has not yet decided whether to extradite Muhayimana. <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/03/201233019333909384.html">France has previously extradited individuals</a> [Al Jazeera report] charged for participating in the Rwandan genocide to face charges at the ICTR in Tanzania, but has not yet extradited anyone to Rwanda itself to stand trial. France has never allowed a French national to be extradited.

<p>Several other individuals are facing charges in Rwandan courts for their involvement in the genocide. In February, the ICTR decided to <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/ictr-decides-to-transfer-second-genocide-case-to-rwanda-court.php">transfer the case of Fulgence Kayishema to the Rwandan authorities</a> [JURIST report].

Also in February, war crimes suspect Leon Mugesera was <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/rwanda-court-charges-genocide-suspect.php">charged with genocide planning, incitement and distribution of arms</a> [JURIST report] in a Kigali court in Rwanda. He was deported from Canada to Rwanda following a 16-year battle in the Canadian court system in which Mugesera attempted to stay in Canada. A speech he made before the Rwandan genocide began, in which he equated Tutsis to cockroaches, is credited with having been the driving force behind the genocide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Seven of Wisconsin's largest public unions challenged the bill on grounds of right to assembly under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> and Equal Protection under the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]. The unions argued that it was unconstitutional to treat public safety employees differently from general employees. The court upheld limitations on what the unions could bargain for, but struck down provisions requiring unions to recertify by an absolute majority annually and prohibiting the voluntary withholding of union dues from a general employee's paycheck. The court found it unconstitutional that unions which supported <a href="http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/">Governor Scott Walker</a> [official website] during his election were apparently given preferential treatment:<blockquote>Absent evidence of viewpoint discrimination, perhaps it is enough that the State of Wisconsin merely chose a dividing line between two classes of unions and applied it evenhandedly, but the court has difficulty with that result where the only apparent reason for discriminating between the entities <em>is</em> their different viewpoints. Indeed, the very reason proffered by the Supreme Court in <em>Ysursa</em> for not interfering in an outright ban on all political payroll deductions for public unions&#8212;the State's interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of favoritism or entanglement with partisan politics&#8212;is the very reason this court cannot uphold the State of Wisconsin's apparent, if not actual, favoritism and entanglement  in partisan politics by discriminating in favor of fundraising efforts on behalf of public safety unions over general employee unions.</blockquote>The court enjoined the relevant provisions of the Budget Repair Bill.

<p>The Budget Repair Bill requires state employees to contribute a percentage of their salaries to their pension and health care premiums, and eliminates the ability of public employee union members to collectively negotiate anything but wage increase, which will be capped by the Consumer Price Index. The <a href="http://www.wicourts.gov/about/organization/supreme/index.htm">Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/wisconsin-supreme-court-upholds-union-bargaining-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST repor] the Budget Repair Bill in June, overruling the <a href="http://www.countyofdane.com/court/">Dane County Circuit Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/wisconsin-judge-invalidates-union-bargaining-law.php">finding</a> [JURIST report] that legislators had violated the "open meetings" rule. In March, the Dane County Circuit Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-temporarily-blocks-union-bargaining-law.php">temporarily enjoined the law from being published</a>, and then <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-judge-clarifies-ruling-blocking-union-bargaining-law.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST reports] clarifying that the temporary restraining order prohibits not only publication of the bill, but implementation of its provisions as well. The judge's temporary restraining order stemmed from a <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-lawmakers-accused-of-breaking-open-meetings-law.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] filed earlier in March by District Attorney Ismael Ozanne claiming that Republican legislators passed the bill in violation of Wisconsin's open meetings law. Walker <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/wisconsin-governor-signs-bill-limiting-state-worker-collective-bargaining.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the bill into law on March 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="http://ccrjustice.org/">Center for Constitutional Rights</a> (CCR) and the <a href="http://cejil.org/en">Center for Justice and International Law</a> (CEJIL) [advocacy websites], co-counsel for Ameziane, states that Ameziane has been held at Guantanamo Bay without any charge or trial for more than 10 years. This is the first time that the IACHR has agreed to accept jurisdiction over a Guantanamo detainee. J Wells Dixon, Senior Staff Attorney at CCR, stated:<blockquote>Indefinite detention is not an option. Detained men must be afforded fair trials or released. It is long past the time for impunity at Guantanamo to end, and for the closure of Guantanamo to be addressed. Today's IACHR decision is a step in that direction.</blockquote>The IACHR will investigate whether the US's failure to transfer Ameziane is in compliance with international human rights law.

<p>The US has been widely criticized for its policies relating to Guantanamo and indefinite detention. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/en/rights/">Navi Pillay</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/un-rights-chief-urges-us-to-close-guantanamo.php">expressed disappointment</a> [JURIST report] that the US government has failed to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Also that month the Russian <a href="http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/main_eng">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/01/russia-criticizes-us-for-guantanamo-rights-violations.php">criticized the US human rights record</a> [JURIST report], including the indefinite detention of Guantanamo Bay detainees. In August former detainee <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=hicks">David Hicks</a> [JURIST news archive], an Australian national, <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/australia-guantanamo-detainee-hicks-petitions-un-over-alleged-rights-violations.php">filed an appeal</a> [JURIST report] with the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] complaining of multiple violations of international law stemming from his five-year incarceration at Guantanamo from 2002 to 2007. In January 2011 <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2011/01/hrw-urges-greater-efforts-to-close-Guantanamo.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] President Barack Obama make greater efforts to close Guantanamo Bay despite congressional opposition.</p>]]></content:encoded>
