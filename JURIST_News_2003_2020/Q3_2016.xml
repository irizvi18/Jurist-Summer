		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.president-sovet.ru/">Presidential Council for Civil Society Development and Human Rights</a> [official website] on Thursday called on Russian <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/structure/president">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] to <a href="http://www.president-sovet.ru/presscenter/news/read/3299/">reject</a> [appeal, in Russian] a controversial collection of anti-terror bills. The Council, a government department under Putin, urged the president to veto the proposed laws due to what it views as unconstitutionality, legal uncertainty and inconsistency of certain provisions, including criminalizing failure to report a crime, reducing the age of liability to 14 for terrorism-related offenses, collecting telephone and internet data and restricting the freedom of conscience. Prior versions of the bill have caused heated debate among parliamentarians and society more broadly, particularly regarding the data collection provisions. While the final version excludes the more extreme penalties of earlier drafts, it retains the provision requiring communications operators to keep data on the content their customers transmit. The measures have been <a href="http://tass.ru/en/politics/885847">adopted and approved</a> [<em>TASS</em> report] by the upper and lower houses of Russia's parliament.</p>

<p>Many nations have passed controversial anti-terrorism laws in recent years. Last December, <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/china-passes-controversial-anti-terrorism-law.php">China passed a new anti-terrorism law</a> [JURIST report] which requires technology companies to provide information to the government obtained from their products and make information systems "secure and controllable." In August 2015, Egyptian President <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/egypt-passes-sweeping-anti-terrorism-legislation.php">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi approved</a> [JURIST report] a 54-article counter-terrorism law, which has been met with significant controversy as many believe it to be an infringement on freedom of the press. Tunisia's parliament voted to <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/tunisia-parliament-approves-new-anti-terrorism-law.php">approve a new anti-terror law despite strong criticism</a> [JURIST report] from NGOs and human rights groups last July. In January of 2015, <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/amnesty-calls-on-pakistan-to-end-executions.php">Amnesty International called on</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to stop sentencing people for violation of the 1997 Anti-Terrorism Act, which they described as "so vague that almost all crimes fall under [its] definition." Nine bloggers were jailed in Ethiopia in April 2014 for <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/ethiopian-zone-9-bloggers-acquitted.php">violation of Ethiopia's broad anti-terrorism laws</a> [JURIST report], although five of them were acquitted the following October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/">U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/uploads/Gulan_Order.pdf">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [order, PDF] against <a href="https://www.fgulen.com/en/">Muhammed Fethullah Gulen</a>, a prominent Muslim cleric and rival of <a href="http://tccb.gov.tr/">Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official websites], saying the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.  The <a href="/paperchase/uploads/Gulen_Complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [text, PDF] was filed by Bunyamin Ates, Turgut Yildirim and Murat Ozturk setting forth six counts ranging from persecution of members of the Dogan Movement, a religious group,  to false imprisonment and civil conspiracy under Pennsylvania state law.  Some of these counts were alleged pursuant to the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1350">Alien Tort Claims Act</a> [text].  The plaintiffs in the case alleged that Gulen issued orders from within Pennsylvania directing his followers in Turkey to launch "a targeted campaign of persecution against a different religious group in Turkey" in retaliation for criticisms directed against Gulen. They allege that Gulen's actions ultimately resulted in the wrongful incarceration of plaintiffs and dozens of other fellow members of their religious group in Turkey for periods ranging between 8 and 20 months. Recognizing that the alleged conduct had an impact in Turkey and the Supreme Court's caution that US courts should "take into consideration the extent to which the Court would be involving itself in foreign policy or passing judgment on foreign decision-making," the court dismissed counts one through four.  The court added that "even assuming that Plaintiffs pled relevant conduct which 'touches and concerns' the territory of the United States, the foreign policy consequences of this action weigh against this Court recognizing a cause of action."  In dismissing counts five and six, the court looked to the Act of State doctrine and stated that "Plaintiffs are requesting that this Court judge the validity, and not simply determine the occurrence, of the alleged unlawful actions taken by Turkish officials against Turkish citizens in Turkey, a request the Supreme Court would be barred pursuant to the act of state doctrine." In dismissing this complaint, the court recognized that Gulen's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction was properly made under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_12">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)</a> [text], and rejected the plaintiff's request for leave to amend.</p>

<p>Gulen is a Muslim cleric of Turkish origin who promotes an Anatolian version of Islam. Gulen has been a lawful permanent resident in the United States since 1998, but he remains active in Turkey through his followers and weekly online Turkish broadcasts. Erdogan <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-cleric-usa-idUSKCN0ZG238">accuses</a> [Reuters report] Gulen of attempting to overthrow him, and Gulen still faces charges in Turkey in this regard and for plotting against a rival religious group by fabricating evidence and charges. Gulen's name had previously <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/turkish-prosecutor-to-investigate-fabricated-coup-allegations.php">surfaced</a> [JURIST report] in August 2010 when Eskisehir Police Chief Hanefi Avci alleged in a book he had recently published that the <a href="http://www.sabah.com.tr/yazarlar/ilicak/2010/08/23/bu_kitap_cok_tartisilacak">evidence was distorted and fabricated</a> [Sabah report, in Turkish] by Gulen's followers, in effort to weaken the ruling <a href="http://www.akparti.org.tr/site">Justice and Development Party</a> (AKP) [party website, in Turkish]. The government of Turkey has thus far seized newspapers, banks and other companies affiliated with Gulen's movement. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/cms/vfgh-site/index.html">Constitutional Court of Austria</a> [official website, in German] on Friday voided the results of Austria's recent presidential election and <a href="https://www.vfgh.gv.at/cms/vfgh-site/attachments/9/6/5/CH0003/CMS1467363707042/press_release_07-01-16.pdf">ordered</a> [press release] that the election be repeated in its entirety. The May 22 runoff saw Green Party-backed independent <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/23/who-is-austrias-new-president-alexander-van-der-bellen/">Alexander Van der Bellen</a> [Telegraph profile] defeat Norbert Hoffer of the nationalist <a href="https://www.fpoe.at">Freedom Party</a> (FPO) [party website, in German] by only <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36681475#"">30,863 votes</a> [BBC report]. Considering a challenge brought by the FPO, the Constitutional Court found that the opening of votes cast by mail by "auxiliaries" outside of the presence of electoral officers prevented "definitive verification of the postal ballots." Since more than 77,000 postal votes were cast, the court found that the potential manipulation of those ballots may have had an influence on the outcome. Noting the importance of strictly applying election laws, the court said that "[i]f infringements of the law are of an extent that they may have had an influence on the election result, it is of no relevance if manipulations have actually occurred or not." </p>

<p>FPO is one of several right-wing parties making electoral inroads in Europe with a focus on skepticism over the role of the European Union (EU) on the continent. Along with its political allies, such as the French <a href="http://www.frontnational.com/">National Front</a>, the <a href="https://www.alternativefuer.de/">Alternatives for Germany</a> [party websites], and the British <a href="http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/news">Leave Campaign</a> [advocacy website], FPO has achieved some measure of popular support on a platform of urging significant reform of and/or withdrawal from the EU, tighter controls on immigration, and more direct democracy in their home country. Similar popular sentiment propelled British voters to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">choose to leave</a> [JURIST report] the EU. Discussions of when, how and through whom the UK would invoke the withdrawal provisions in <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html">Article 50</a> [text] of the Lisbon Treaty are ongoing. In December, National Front candidates garnered more than <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/marine-le-pen-front-national-france/420348/">6 million</a> [Atlantic report] in regional elections, although it did not win any of the contests in France's 13 metropolitan regions. A concern over the effect of immigration and refugees of the conflict in Syria have been a driving force behind the success of nationalist movements in Europe, with some voters disapproving of the EU's perceived openness to irregular migrants. In June, for example, the European Court of Justice ruled that <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-of-justice-holds-that-immigrants-that-illegally-cross-schengen-area-cannot-be-imprisoned-so.php">migrants cannot be jailed</a> [JURIST report] solely on the basis of crossing a border illegally. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">Federal District Court for Southern Indiana</a> [official website] placed an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/30/us/document-Abortioninjunction.html">injunction</a> [text, PDF] on a restrictive abortion <a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/5/1/b/5/51b52d50/HB1337.05.ENRS.pdf">law</a> [text, PDF] Thursday, just days after the<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/"> US Supreme Court</a> [official website] found similar Texas legislation to be unconstitutional. The Indiana law would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. The judge also enjoined  a provision for information dissemination practices, and another provision mandating the types of arrangements that can be made for the disposal of the fetal tissue. The court held that the anti-discrimination provisions, which specifically prohibit pre-viability abortions based on certain enumerated classes, would likely be found unconstitutional under several Supreme Court precedents. Such precedents root a woman's right to choose a pre-viability termination under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]. Also paramount in consideration for this provision was the weight of this right against the state's interest in restricting abortions. The information provision was blocked because it would likely force providers to give out false information. The tissue disposal mandate, which would require either a burial or cremation of the fetal remains, was enjoined because a fetus is not legally considered a person and therefore no mandate based on the personhood of a fetus is likely to be granted. </p>

<p>Earlier this week the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a Texas <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a>. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment [text] as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://supremecourt.nmcourts.gov/">New Mexico Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://nmpovertylaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Opinion-Supreme-Court-Rodriguez-Aguirre-2016-06-30.pdf">ruled </a> [text, PDF] that the exclusion of farm and ranch workers from the New Mexico's <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter52">Worker Compensation Act</a> [text] is unconstitutional. The court relied on legislative interpretation to hold that the exclusion of the farm workers served no purpose in the furtherance of the act, and that the discrimination against such workers was wholly arbitrary. The opinion stated, " [t]he Legislature is at liberty to offer economic advantages to the agricultural industry, but it may not do so at the sole expense of the farm and ranch laborer while protecting all other agricultural workers." The court found that the explicit exclusion of farm and ranch laborers in &sect; 52-1-6(A) of the Act violated Article II, Section 18 of the <a href="http://www.sos.state.nm.us/Public_Records_And_Publications/2013nmconst.pdf">New Mexico Constitution</a> [text, PDF] because it was not founded on real differences in classification that reasonably justify separate treatment.</p>

<p>Standards on employment issues are ever-changing in the US. In April, the California Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/california-top-court-rules-employees-entitled-to-a-chair.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that employees who can do their jobs while seated are entitled to a place to sit. The court held in a 7-0 ruling that "if the tasks being performed at a given location reasonably permit sitting, and provision of a seat would not interfere with performance of any other tasks that may require standing, a seat is called for." In February the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rules-tip-distribution-violates-labor-standards.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that employers may no longer collect tips from service employees and share them with support staffed even if the tipped employees are receiving minimum wage. Earlier that month Oregon legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/oregon-lawmakers-approve-highest-minimum-wage-in-country.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a law creating the highest minimum wage in the country. Also in February West Virginia became the twenty-sixth state to pass a right-to-work law, <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/west-virginia-legislature-passes-right-to-work-law.php">barring employers</a> [JURIST report] from requiring that their employees pay union fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada </a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16044/index.do">overturned</a> [decision] a man's drug possession and trafficking conviction because he had been made to wait too long for his trial. The man, Shane Vassal, had waited three years before his three day trial was held, leading the court to the conclusion that he was denied the right to be tried within a reasonable time in violation of <a href="https://zoupio.lexum.com/calegis/schedule-b-to-the-canada-act-1982-uk-1982-c-11-en#!fragment/sec11/KGhhc2g6KGNodW5rxIVhbsSHb3JUZXh0OnNlYzExKSxsZWZ0UMSNZU5vdGVJZDonJyxuxKZlc1F1ZXJ5xKvErXNjcm9sbEPEiMSKOiFuLMSXYXLEh8SzxLXEt8SsxYZlxYjEh1PEkHRCxLdSRUxFVkFOQ0UsdGFiOnRvYykp">s.11 of the Canadian Chart of Rights and Freedom</a> [materials]. <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/court-cour/judges-juges/bio-eng.aspx?id=michael-j-moldaver">Justice Michael Moldaver</a> [official profile], writing for the court, stated that, in considering a legal case, "courts must be careful not to miss the forest for the trees," and that "[l]ooking at this forest - that is, the overal delay in a case of moderate complexity - [he is] satisfied that the delay was unreasonable." Adding to the courts rationale was the fact that Vassal had taken "proactive steps...to have his case tried as soon as possible." After discussing the inability of Vassal to move the case along, despite his varied efforts, and the actions of his six co-accused to cause the delay, the court allowed the appeal and issued a stay of proceedings.</p>

<p>The right to a speedy trial has been a developing issue within recent American jurisprudence as well. In May the United States Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-rules-right-to-speedy-trial-does-not-include-sentencing.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that its Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial guarantee did not extend beyond conviction. In October of 2013 a federal appeals court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/10/appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the conviction of a former Guantanamo prisoner against claims that his detainment and interrogation by the CIA held up his trial. In May of 2011 the Supreme Court also <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/05/supreme-court-rules-in-speedy-trial-act-case.php">issued a decision</a> [JURIST report] to the detriment of the right to a speedy trial, stating that time delays in regards to pre-trial motions were also excluded</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://ecf.insd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?12015cv0220-116">struck down</a> [decision, PDF] the state's parenthood statute for violating the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/constitutions/united_states.php#amendment_xiv">Fourteenth Amendment</a> [text]. Indiana Code Section <a href="http://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-31-family-law-and-juvenile-law/in-code-sect-31-9-2-15.html">31-9-2-15</a>, <a href="http://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-31-family-law-and-juvenile-law/in-code-sect-31-9-2-16.html">31-9-2-16</a>, and <a href="http://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-31-family-law-and-juvenile-law/in-code-sect-31-14-7-1.html">31-14-7-1</a> provide that only birth mothers would be listed on a birth certificate, meaning that, where one lesbian partner undergoes artificial insemination, the other woman would not be granted parental status to the child. Under Indiana law, men whose wives are artificially inseminated are listed as the parent on the birth certificate, providing ample grounds for an equal protection argument. Against the state's argument that the law is applied equally - men who are not the biological father of the child are not to be listed on the birth certificate - to men and women, the court held that "the State's interest in protecting the best interests of the child when making determinations in the family law context," were not satisfied under a heightened intermediate scrutiny examination. The state claimed that "preserving the rights of biological fathers and recording and maintaining accurate records regarding the biological parentage of children," though the court found this argument unconvincing. The court also found that the State had interfered with a fundamental right of the women to "freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life." The judge granted summary judgment on the matter and permanently enjoined the state from enforcing the laws in a way which would prevent presumption of parenthood granted to a same-sex, female spouse.</p>

<p>The lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender community (LGBT) continues to face legal challenges throughout the world. In November of last year a Utah judge <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/utah-judge-reverses-order-denying-foster-rights-to-same-sex-couple.php">reversed an order</a> [JURIST report] denying foster rights to a same-sex couple. Earlier that month the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples can legally adopt. In June the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-office-reports-continued-lgbt-discrimination.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses. Abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole, said 12 UN agencies in a joint statement <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in September. The commission found that while LGBT rights have increased since the UN's first study, there remains widespread discrimination and violence towards these individuals. Last November the OHCHR <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-office-condemns-singapore-homosexuality-ruling.php">criticized</a> a Singapore Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/10/singapore-top-court-affirms-law-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] upholding a law criminalizing consensual same-sex relations between adult men. Last September the UN released a video <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/09/un-sg-urges-nations-to-end-discrimination-against-lgbt-people.php">calling for an end to LGBT discrimination</a> [JURIST report] in all countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Ban on transgender service members lifted</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> <a href="http://www.defense.gov/About-DoD/Biographies/Biography-View/Article/602689/ashton-b-carter">Secretary of Defense Ash Carter</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/821675/secretary-of-defense-ash-carter-announces-policy-for-transgender-service-members">announced</a> [press release] a new <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/Special-Reports/0616_transgender-policy">policy</a> [materials] that allows transgender individuals to serve openly in the military, effective immediately. The <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/821833/remarks-on-ending-the-ban-on-transgender-service-in-the-us-military">announcement</a> [speech], <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/pentagon-to-announce-repeal-of-its-ban-on-transgender-service-members.php">promised</a> [JURIST report] last week, lifted the ban that not only prevented transgender persons from serving in the military but also made a transgender identity grounds for discharge. The policy shift came after a Rand study was conducted to determine the cost and benefits of the ban. The <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] will begin to update the military policies and regulations within the year to reflect the change. Furthermore, the policy will allow for medical benefits and care to aid in the transition process and address any associated health issues that were previously not covered due to the ban:<blockquote>Starting today: Otherwise qualified servicemembers can no longer be involuntarily separated, discharged, or denied reenlistment or continuation of service just for being transgender. Then, no later than 90 days from today: The Department will complete and issue both a commanders' guidebook for leading currently-serving transgender servicemembers, and medical guidance to doctors for providing transition-related care if required to currently-serving transgender servicemembers. Our military treatment facilities will begin providing transgender servicemembers with all medically necessary care based on that medical guidance. Also starting on that date, servicemembers will be able to initiate the process to officially change their gender in our personnel management systems.</blockquote>The full policy has an implementation date of July 1, 2017.</p>

<p>Legal issues facing transgender individuals have been at the forefront recently. Last week a judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-orders-school-board-to-allow-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a Virginia school board to allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Last month a judge from Multnomah County Circuit Court in Oregon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/oregon-court-recognizes-non-binary-as-a-legal-gender.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an individual's gender could be legally changed from female to non-binary." Also in June a US magistrate judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-transgender-inmate-must-be-given-access-to-female-items.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an order requiring California prions to provide transgender inmates who identify as female access to female-oriented items to which inmates have access in women's correctional facilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.unog.ch/unog/website/news_media.nsf/(httpNewsByYear_en)/F19440AFA74912F7C1257FE30058DEEA?OpenDocument">called</a> [press release] on the <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> (AU) [official website] Friday to respond to a <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/093/42/PDF/G1609342.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF] that detailed gross human rights violations in Eritrea. The report found that systemic and widespread gross violations in the detention facilities and military camps may even amounts to crimes against humanity. The council had previously <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20210&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] on the AU for assistance in providing accountability mechanisms for judicial reasons. The <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/G16/134/68/PDF/G1613468.pdf?OpenElement">resolution</a> [text, PDF] included the following:<blockquote>[The Human Rights Council] Strongly encourages the African Union to follow up on the report and recommendations of the commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea by establishing an investigation, supported by the international community, with a view to examining and bringing to justice those responsible for violations and abuses of human rights identified by<br />
the commission of inquiry, including any that may amount to a crime against humanity.</blockquote>The call was <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/african-union-investigate-eritrean-crimes-160701174726718.html">welcomed</a> [Al Jazeera report] by activists, human rights groups and Eritreans who see the resolution as a necessary first step in addressing the issues. Eritrea denies all allegations that it has committed crimes against humanity. </p>

<p>Eritrea has faced much criticism from the international community for continued abuses of human rights. In 2013 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/un-rights-expert-urges-eritrea-to-stop-human-rights-violations.php">called</a> for an end to human rights abuses in Eritrea and appealed to the international community to increase <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-urges-increased-scrutiny-in-eritrea.php">scrutiny</a> [JURIST reports] of the nation. The UN also pleaded <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-urges-international-community-to-aid-eritrea-refugees.php">aid</a> [JURIST report] for Eritrean refugees, as denial of asylum would most likely condemn them to death, based on the country's <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.53_ENG.pdf">shoot to kill order</a> [report, PDF] for anyone attempting to leave the country illegally. In late 2013 a report from Dutch and Swedish researchers discovered that officers of the Eritrean military were <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/report-finds-eritreas-military-involved-in-human-trafficking-to-sudan.php">kidnapping children</a> [JURIST report] and smuggling them into Sudan. In March 2015 another UN commission released a <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-commission-reports-human-rights-violations-in-eritrea.php">report</a> [JURIST report] that found that the various human rights abuses found in Eritrea included torture, a large number of detentions, and paltry wages insufficient for an adequate standard of living.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US District Judge Robert Hinkle issued a <a href="http://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/show_temp.pdf">preliminary injunction</a> [order, PDF] on Thursday blocking provisions of a new Florida law that would cut state funding to clinics that provide abortions. Though the law was planned to take effect on Friday, <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] affiliates <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-abortion-idUSKCN0ZH5I3">challenged</a> [Reuters report] the law's constitutionality. Hinkle found that cutting funding to certain abortion clinics would be unreasonable since such clinics provide a variety of other medical services. In response to a provision requiring additional inspections of abortion clinic patient records, Hinkle further found that abortion clinics are already subject to requirements that exceed those of standard medical facilities. Planned Parenthood affiliates praised the judge's ruling, calling it a victory for women's health. The <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/">Florida Department of Health</a> and Florida Governor <a href="http://www.flgov.com/">Rick Scott</a> [official websites] have yet to comment on the matter. </p>

<p>The Florida law comes in the wake of conservative efforts to adopt new state abortion laws. Also this week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-federal-court-blocks-state-abortion-bill.php">placed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on an Indiana law that would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. Earlier this week the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a Texas <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge on Thursday <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/barber_v_bryant_hb_1523_pi_decision.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a Mississippi law allowing for religious objections to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-judge-blocks-mississippi-law-limiting-gay-marriage-40269162">unconstitutional</a> [AP report]. <a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2016/html/HB/1500-1599/HB1523SG.htm">HB 1523</a> [text], set to go into effect Friday, sought to protect three religious beliefs: "(a) Marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman; (b) Sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage; and (c) Male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual's immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth." The bill would have allowed court clerks, businesses, and private persons to invoke religious exceptions in defense of discriminatory treatment. Judge Carlton Reeves of the <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi</a> [official website] granted the plaintiffs' requst for preliminary injunction and declared the bill unconstitutional based on the Establishment Clause, religious freedom, and equal protection. Reeves stated:<blockquote>Religious freedom was one of the building blocks of this great nation, and after the nation was torn apart, the guarantee of equal protection under law was used to stitch it back together. But HB 1523 does not honor that tradition of religion freedom, nor does it respect the equal dignity of all of Mississippi's citizens. It must be enjoined.</blockquote>Mississippi <a href="http://www.governorbryant.com/">Governor Phil Bryant</a> [official profile] has stated that he does not agree with the outcome and intends to pursue an appeal.</p>

<p>The challenge to HB 1523 came after the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and the <a href="http://www.aclu-ms.org/">ACLU of Mississippi</a> [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-mississippi-religious-freedom-law.php">federal lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging the bill and seeking the same injunctive relief. The LGBT community continues to face legal challenges everywhere. The <a href="http://www.insd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-district-court-parenthood-statute-violates-fourteenth-amendment.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] the state's parenthood statute for violating the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Last month a judge from <a href="http://courts.oregon.gov/multnomah/Pages/index.aspx">Multnomah County Circuit Court</a> [official website] in Oregon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/oregon-court-recognizes-non-binary-as-a-legal-gender.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an individual's gender could be legally changed from from female to non-binary. Also last month, Bleu Copas and Caleb Laieski <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/gay-men-challenge-tennessee-counseling-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in the Chancery Court for Anderson County challenging a Tennessee law that protects counselors who refuse to provide services to individuals based on their religious beliefs. In May the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19479">signed 20 bills into law</a> [legislative list], six of which were bills altering the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-brown-guns-20160701-snap-story.html">gun laws in the state</a> [LA Times report]. Brown <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/docs/AB_1511_Signing_Message.pdf">stated</a> [text, PDF] that he signed the bills "to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners." The bills have various effects, such as expanding the definition of "assault weapon" [AB 1135 <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1135">text</a>; SB 880 <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB880">text</a>], specifying relationships qualified for lending weapons [AB 1511 <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1511">text</a>], making it a misdemeanor to make a false report about a lost or stolen firearm [AB 1695 <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1695">text</a>], creating regulations regarding who can purchase ammunition [SB 1235 <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1235">text</a>], and prohibiting possession of a large-capacity magazine capable of holding more than ten rounds [SB 1446 <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1446">text</a>]. The laws come after months of debate within the state following the San Bernardino shootings.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Last week the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-upholds-firearm-prohibitions-for-reckless-domestic-violence.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 6-2 that a state law conviction on reckless domestic assault is sufficient to bar possession of a firearm under federal law. Earlier in June Hawaii Governor David Ige <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/hawaii-governor-signs-bill-to-put-gun-owners-on-fbi-database.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring gun owners to be listed on an FBI database, notifying police if a Hawaii citizen is arrested in another state and providing a continuous criminal record check on those individuals seeking to possess a firearm. Also in June, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-assault-weapons-bans.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases challenging bans on assault-style weapons. The court denied the appeals without comment, letting stand lower court rulings that had <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld the bans</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional. In response to the mass killing in Orlando in June, the UN's top human rights official <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-chief-calls-for-increased-gun-control-in-us.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its gun control measures. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-authorities-may-require-permits-for-concealed-handguns-in-public.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in June that the right to carry a concealed gun is not within Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/">North Carolina General Assembly</a> [official website] adjourned for the year on Friday after making only minor changes to the state's highly criticized <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v1.pdf">House Bill 2</a> [materials]. Legislators <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-carolina-hb2-bathroom-bill-lgbt-law-left-mostly-intact/">altered</a> [CBS report] the original law by restoring the right to sue in state court for discriminatory employment discrimination. The legislators, however, expressed no intention to change the controversial provisions that have been publicly criticized for restricting the rights of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Republican leaders have continued to support the law's requirement that transgender people use restrooms and changing facilities corresponding to their birth certificate gender. Senate leader <a href="http://www.philberger.org/about_phil_berger">Phil Berger</a> [official profile] has reiterated that the restriction is vital for the safety and privacy of other facility users. The NBA has threatened to move the All-Star game out of the state in response to HB 2. While some state Democrats expect that legislators might need to hold a special session to prevent the loss of business, House Speaker <a href="http://www.repmoore.com/?page_id=2">Tim Moore</a> [official profile] has expressed his hopes that the law's revisions will appease its critics. The revisions will be reviewed by <a href="http://governor.nc.gov/about-governor-mccrory">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official profile] who has been one of the bill's strongest promoters.</p>

<p>North Carolina's stance on LGBT rights has been a topic of national controversy. In April, McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/north-carolina-governor-seeks-to-clarify-controversial-transgender-law.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] to clarify HB 2 in response to significant backlash. In March North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated during a press conference that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">would not defend</a> [JURIST report] the law, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. Earlier that week North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill he signed one week prior was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal appeals court on Friday <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/6FBE86781BACCC0A85257FE30050BB60/$file/13-5360-1622673.pdf">rejected</a> [opinion, PDF] the Alaskan government's challenge in a case determining the right of Alaskan tribes to place land in a federal trust. Alaskan tribes originally <a href="http://www.ktoo.org/2016/07/01/federal-court-sides-with-tribes-in-alaska-indian-country-land-rights-case/">sued</a> [KTOO report] the <a href="https://www.doi.gov/">Department of the Interior</a> [official website] in 2007 to place land in a trust. Though the Interior Department found that denying such rights would be discriminatory, the state nevertheless proceeded with challenging Alaskan tribes in the matter. Following the court's ruling, Alaskan tribes will be able to seek "Indian Country" status from the <a href="http://www.indianaffairs.gov/">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> (BIA) [official website] and obtain the protections afforded to ordinary reservation lands in the Lower 48. The BIA is expected to publish trust land application within the next 30 days. </p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing international legal topic in the past decade. In May Canada's Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-adopts-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] it would drop its objector status against the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In April JURIST Guest Columnist Dwight Newman of the University of Saskatchewan <a href="/forum/2016/04/Dwight-Newman-indigenous-rights.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] what is happening with recent leave decisions related to Indigenous rights and Canadian energy regulation. In March Canadian indigenous people, including Inuits of Nunavut and the Chippewa, were <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/inuit-appeal-seismic-testing-case-to-canadas-highest-court.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, challenging the use of seismic testing to find natural gas under the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay. In February experts from the UN and the Inter-American human rights systems <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-call-on-canada-to-address-violence-against-indigenous-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Canada to address the "root causes" of the extreme violence and discrimination against indigenous women and girls in that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] voted on Thursday in favor of appointing an independent expert to report on and investigate worldwide violence and discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. The appointment <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/europe/united-nations-gay-lesbian-trans.html">passed</a> [NYT report] by a vote of 23 to 18 with 6 abstentions. Supporters of the initiative referenced the recent violence against LGBT individuals in Orlando, Florida, and stressed that the UN must give a voice to those discriminated for their sexual orientation and gender identity. Opponents such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Nigeria, argued that such an initiative was religiously or culturally motivated and does not properly reflect the views of the entire UNHRC. British Ambassador <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/julian-braithwaite">Julian Braithwaite </a> [official profile] responded to opponentsby stating that a vote against the initiative was a vote for discrimination and violence. </p>

<p>LGBT individuals continue to face discrimination throughout the world. Abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole, said 12 UN agencies in a joint statement <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">released</a> [JURIST report] in September. The commission found that while LGBT rights have increased since the UN's first study, there remains widespread discrimination and violence towards these individuals. In 2014 the UN human rights office <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-rights-office-condemns-singapore-homosexuality-ruling.php">criticized</a> a Singapore Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/singapore-top-court-affirms-law-criminalizing-homosexuality.php">decision</a> [JURIST reports] upholding a law criminalizing consensual same-sex relations between adult men. Also that year the UN released a video <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/un-sg-urges-nations-to-end-discrimination-against-lgbt-people.php">calling for an end to LGBT discrimination</a> [JURIST report] in all countries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) will not prosecute Tony Blair for war crimes related to the 2003 Iraq War, according to the <em>Telegraph</em>. The ICC <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/02/outrage-as-war-crimes-prosecutors-say-tony-blair-will-not-be-inv/">said</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> report] Saturday that the decision "by the UK to go to war in Iraq falls outside the Court's jurisdiction." The ICC also said that it will be analyzing the "Chilcot Report" for evidence of war crimes committed by British soldiers. Mr. Blair served as the Prime Minister of UK throughout the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">Iraq War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been plagued with accusations of war crimes and atrocities, aimed at the different parties and countries involved in the conflict. The "Chilcot Report" is an inquiry into the Iraq War. The inquiry will examine the period before the UK ended their troop presence in Iraq in 2009 and after the summer before the September 11 attacks. The report has been named after the inquiry's chair, Sir John Chilcot and it has been reported that the inquiry's objective was not to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/chilcot-report-legality-of-iraq-war-was-never-part-of-inquiry-says-expert">answer</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] whether the Iraq War was legal. The report has taken approximately seven years to culminate and will be published on Wednesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan authorities have detained three police officers for their involvement in the murder of a human rights lawyer. The officers have not yet been charged with the murders, but a judge announced they <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36703271">will remain</a> [BBC report] in detention for two weeks as investigations are conducted. The body of Willie Kimani, a Nairobi lawyer working for the human rights and law enforcement organization <a href="https://www.ijm.org/">International Justice Mission</a> (IJM) [official website], was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/world/africa/kenya-lawyer-missing-kimani-police.html?_r=0">found</a> [NYT report] on Friday along with a client and a taxi driver. Mr. Kimani had accompanied his client, Josephat Mwenda, to court after filing a complaint against a police driver for unlawfully shooting him in the arm. Mr. Mwenda had accused the police of "harassing him for more than a year after" filing the report. The three went missing shortly after leaving the courthouse.</p>

<p>The murders have outraged the international and domestic communities. A statement by 34 international human rights organizations <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/kenya-investigate-killings-of-lawyer-two-men/">condemned</a> [AI report] the murders and hundreds have taken to the streets of Nairobi to <a href="http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/reuters/hundreds-protest-in-nairobi-over-death-of-kenyan-rights-lawyer/42271918">protest</a> [Swiss Info report] extrajudicial killings in the capital. Western governments who provide financial support to Kenya have also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/04/kenya-protest-nairobi-alleged-extrajudicial-killings-willie-kimani">expressed</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] their concern over the murders and are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/world/africa/kenya-lawyer-missing-human-rights-police.html?action=click&contentCollection=Africa&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article">urging</a> [NYT report] the country to reform and comply with international human rights standards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vietnam has <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.vn/vi/tt_baochi/pbnfn/ns160704144935">urged</a> ]statement, in Vietnamese] the international tribunal in The Hague to deliver a "fair and objective" ruling concerning Philippines' challenge to China's expansive claims in the South China Sea. Two days after the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> (PCA) [official website] <a href="http://www.pcacases.com/web/sendAttach/1782">announced</a> [press release, PDF] July 12 as the verdict date, Vietnam's <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.vn/vi/">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website, in Vietnamese] said that it hoped the ruling would lead to a peaceful resolution of the dispute. Although Vietnam is not a direct party to the case, any favorable ruling to the Philippines will benefit the country, since Vietnam is also at odds with China. Vietnam has been careful not to assert its interests in a direct or confrontational manner against China, which is a major trade partner to the country. As such, Vietnam's statement <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-ruling-vietnam-idUSKCN0ZI07M">stopped short</a> [Reuters report] of calling for the ruling to be respected, contrary to the statements given by numerous other countries.  </p>

<p>Despite Vietnam's cautious approach in this matter, its relations with China have not been particularly cozy. On Monday, Vietnam expressed its <a href="http://news.chinhphu.vn/Home/VN-demands-China-immediately-stop-military-drills-in-East-Sea/20167/27756.vgp">outrage</a> [press release] at China&#8217;s plan to carry out military drills from July 5-11 in an area that covers Vietnam&#8217;s Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelago in the East Sea, and demanded that China respect Vietnam's territorial sovereignty. China claims nearly the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/philippines-high-court-approves-deal-to-extend-us-military-presence.php">entire 3.5 million square-kilometer</a> [JURIST report] South China Sea, a region believed to be rich in oil and minerals. China has come into territorial conflict over the region in the past not only <a href="/sidebar/2011/07/edsel-tupaz-spratlys-dispute.php">with the Philippines</a> [JURIST op-ed], but also with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippines and China were involved in a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/07/201273093650328417.html">two month stand-off</a> [Al Jazeera report] that started last April around the Scarborough Shoal, a small cluster of uninhabitable islands 220 km off the coast of the Philippines which, according to international maritime law, fall into the Philippines' economic zone. The standoff was triggered when Chinese vessels blocked the Philippine navy from arresting Chinese fishermen for alleged illegal fishing activities within the Philippines' exclusive economic zones. The PCA in The Hague ruled in October that it has jurisdiction to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hague-court-to-rule-in-south-china-sea-dispute.php">hear the dispute</a> [JURIST report] between the Philippines and China over parts of the South China Sea. For its part, China has refused to recognize PCA's jurisdiction on the case, even going as far as calling it a "law-abusing tribunal." However, the case seeks an interpretation of the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (UNCLOS) [materials], to which China is a signatory.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The First Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin near Beijing jailed Ling Jihua, a top aide to former China president <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hu-Jintao">Hu Jintao</a> [Britannica profile], and <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-07/04/c_135487984.htm">sentenced him to life</a> [Xinhua report] after finding him guilty of taking bribes, illegally obtaining state secrets and abuse of power. This sentence comes after the Supreme People's Court of China's <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-high-court-confirms-death-penalty-for-serious-corruption-cases.php">confirmation in April</a> [JURIST report] that the maximum penalty for the crime of corruption in the form of embezzlement or accepting bribes amounting to high sums of money will be the death penalty. The verdict against Ling was announced during a secret trial in which his wife, Gu Liping, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-corruption-idUSKCN0ZK0M7">testified against him via video</a> [Reuters report] and multimedia presentations of evidence. According to Xinhua News Agency (XNA), the government's official press, Ling accepted bribes amounting to over 77.08 million yuan or almost US $11.6 million.  During the trial on June 7, the court summoned Lou Zhongfu and Cui Xiaoyu as witnesses, both of whom testified that they offered bribes to Ling or his wife. According to XNA, Ling also abused his power to assist two individuals and their relatives with job transfers, house purchase, promotion, and change of residential status, causing substantial losses to public funds. XNA also reports that Ling illegally obtained a large amount of classified materials through Huo Ke, the then head of the secretariat of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee's General Office and others, which seriously compromised the country's secrecy system. According to the court, Ling's deceased son Ling Gu was also briefly mentioned as having taken bribes, a fact that Ling was aware of but did nothing to prevent. According to the court, Ling pled guilty and decided not to appeal. He has also been deprived of his political rights for life and had his personal assets confiscated. </p>

<p>The CPC announced the opening of its investigation of Ling in December 2014, as a part of another chapter in President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11551399">Xi Jinping</a>'s [BBC profile] sweeping campaign against corruption which he began more than three years ago, following his appointment in 2013. Ever since Xi's appointment, China has stepped up prosecutions for domestic corruption. In February the Hangzhou Christian Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/prominent-china-pastor-under-investigation-for-corruption.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that a prominent Chinese Pastor is under investigation for corruption involving the embezzlement of state funds. In November a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/china-court-jails-top-aide-to-former-security-chief-for-corruption.php">jailed a top aide to the country's former security chief</a> [JURIST report] Zhou Yongkang on corruption charges. In October Chinese state media reported that the former head of the country's biggest oil firm was <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/former-china-oil-firm-chairman-jailed-for-corruption.php">sentenced to 16 years in prison</a> [JURIST report] for corruption. In September prosecutors in China announced that they will be investigating former China Supreme Court justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-china-senior-judge-to-be-prosecuted-for-corruption.php">Xi Xiaoming on corruption charges</a> [JURIST report]. In August a former general in China's People's Liberation Army, <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/china-court-sentences-former-general-to-death.php">Gu Junshan, was sentenced</a> [JURIST report] by a Chinese military court to death with a two year reprieve for corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] warned Monday of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20229&LangID=E">deteriorating human rights situation</a> [press release] in the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/CFIndex.aspx">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) [UN materials]. "While 2016 began on a positive note, with the successful holding of elections in February, recent events in Bangui and in several other parts of the country make me fear a re-escalation of violence in the coming months," Zeid stated. He called for the disarming of armed groups, restoration of the rule of law and protection of civilians. Zeid also called for restoring confidence in the justice system: "The steps taken by the authorities to establish the Special Criminal Court and the adoption of a new Constitution are promising, but I remain concerned at the large number of arbitrary arrests and detentions by security forces. ... More resources and political will are needed to ensure proper justice for past and current crimes and human rights violations."</p>

<p>Violence has persisted in the CAR since the predominately Muslim-based Seleka rebels ousted former president <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2854669.stm">François Bozize</a> [BBC profile] in March 2013. More than 400,000 people remain displaced due to the violent overthrow, with over a half million more people seeking refuge in other countries. Last month UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] stated there have been <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-report-269-confirmed-human-rights-violations-in-central-african-republic.php">269 verified human rights violations</a> in the CAR. In February the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusca/">UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the CAR</a> [official website] called for the CAR to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-urges-central-african-republic-to-address-rights-violations.php">address numerous human rights violations</a> [JURIST report] stemming from an outbreak of violence in Bangui last year. In November <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [official website] called for aid to approximately 1.2 million <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/unicef-urges-aid-for-12-million-children-in-central-african-republic.php">children distressed by conflict</a> [JURIST report] in the CAR.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/management/senstaff_details.asp?smgID=186">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20237&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press release] Sunday's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36701882">suicide bombing</a> [BBC report] in Baghdad, Iraq. Stating that "the sheer unrestrained viciousness of these people defies belief," Zeid spoke strongly against the taking of innocent lives by terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State (IS). Zeid, however, advised those fighting against the terrorist organization to avoid "hasty" acts of revenge. He warned that such responses "will enabl[e] [terrorist organizations] to tap into resentments about heavy-handed or unlawful responses to recruit more followers, create more fanatics and suicide bombers."</p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. Last month a UN-mandated human rights inquiry reported that IS had been <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-islamic-state-committing-genocide-against-yazidi-people.php">committing genocide</a> [JURIST report] against the Yazidi people, in addition to a carrying out a variety of other war crimes and human rights violations. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that IS was "responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Also in March the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">unanimously passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and calling for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states. In December Amnesty International said that <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-islamic-state-armed-due-to-reckless-arms-trading-with-iraq.php">IS was in possession of a "large and lethal" arsenal</a> [JURIST report] due to decades of reckless arms trading and the poorly regulated international flow of weapons into Iraq. In November IS <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/arrests-made-in-connection-to-france-terrorist-attacks.php">claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated attacks in Paris</a> [JURIST report] that killed more than 120 individuals. In September members of Iraq's Yazidi community met with International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/iraq-yazidi-minority-urge-icc-genocide-investigation.php">urged the court to open a genocide investigation [JURIST report] into IS actions in Northern Iraq.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Armed opposition groups are <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/syria-abductions-torture-and-summary-killings-at-the-hands-of-armed-groups/">committing war crimes</a> [press release] in Syria, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/4227/2016/en/">report</a> [report, PDF] Tuesday. While the report acknowledges that many violations of international human rights law have been committed by government forces, it focuses on the heavy reliance on the "rule of the gun" by opposition forces in quasi-government forms. It covers a total of 24 cases of abductions, five of which involved the torture of the captured individual. Several of those captured were journalists and others were lawyers, political activists, civilians and even some children. The report then discusses the torture and summary killings that many civilians have been subjected to and concludes with recommendations that opposition groups oppose "all human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law," and stop arbitrary detention of individuals, especially when it is based solely on political or religious ideology. AI urged the international community to stop supporting such forces and to pressure them to stop committing such atrocities.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In March AI reported that Russian and Syrian armed forces were deliberately attacking hospitals and other medical facilities as part of a military strategy to clear the way to northern Aleppo. Just prior, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/legislation-addressing-war-crimes-genocide-in-the-middle-east-passes-foreign-affairs-committee/">passed</a> [press release] two resolutions calling for an international tribunal in the Middle East to address the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-house-committee-calls-for-syria-war-crimes-tribunal.php">alleged war crimes </a>[JURIST report] committed by the government of Syria and its allies, specifically Russia and Iran. In February the UN reported that the Syrian government is systematically exterminating<a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-office-syria-systematically-exterminating-detainees.php"> detainees </a>[JURIST report]. In November Human Rights Watch released a report stating that the practice of caging captured soldiers and civilians constitutes<a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-syria-armed-groups-are-committing-war-crimes.php"> hostage-taking</a> [JURIST report] and an outrage against their personal dignity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] Director James Comey <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b.-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clintons-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">announced</a> [press release] Tuesday that he is not recommending that the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] bring criminal charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Comey <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-won-t-recommend-clinton-be-indicted-over-private-email-use-1467731774">stated</a> [WSJ report] that while Clinton was "extremely careless" with her use of private e-mail servers, there is not clear evidence that the secretary or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information. Comey stated that the FBI found more than 110 e-mails on Clinton's private server containing classified information and seven e-mail chains were classified as "Top Secret/Special Access Program level." Comey admitted he believed it possible that people hostile to the US had gained access to her personal e-mail address and stated, "[t]here is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation." During a subsequent review, more than 2,000 e-mails on Clinton's server were found to have contained information now deemed classified, though they were not marked as such when sent.</p>

<p>The -Clinton "email scandal" came to light in March 2015 when it was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html?_r=0">reported</a> [NYT report] that she "exclusively used a personal email account to conduct government business as secretary of state." It was determined that former Clinton never used a government e-mail address during her tenure in the State Department nor were her personal e-mails preserved on department servers, as required by the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/about/laws/fed-agencies.html">Federal Records Act</a> [text]. "Under federal law, letters and emails written and received by federal officials, such as the secretary of state, are considered government records and are supposed to be retained so that congressional committees, historians and members of the news media can find them."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain's leading public-interest law firm as well as several experience litigators are drafting a legal challenge to the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887">EU referendum</a> [BBC profile].  The hope is to stop Britain's exit from the EU, or, at the very least, create a parliamentary debate on the referendum. The action is expected to head to the country's <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/">Supreme Court</a> [official website], with the hopes of being ruled on by September. They litigators are questioning whether the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street">Prime Minister</a> [official website] has the legal power to implement the referendum's results without a debate and vote by lawmakers. The hope is that the UK's departure from the EU can be stopped if the prime minister is required to get <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/">Parliament</a>'s [official website] consent in order to trigger <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html">Article 50</a> [text], which will initiate a two-year process to leave the EU. Currently the majority of Parliament is against leaving the EU. It is also being argued that the referendum was set up to be advisory not mandatory and therefore does not have to be followed.</p>

<p>A majority of British Citizens <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">voted to leave</a> [JURIST report] the EU last month. Concern over the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZB090">economic health of Britain</a> [Reuters report] going into the future led to a global market plunge following the vote, as the pound fell as far as 10 percent against the dollar&#8212;a low not seen since 1985. While the vote has fallen in favor of departure, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/legal-implications-britain-votes-leave-eu-brexit">no legal changes have taken place yet</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], as Britain must take further steps to confirm its separation. The EU has set out a mechanism for leaving in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, where a member state "may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements," and "must notify the European council of its intention." Under Article 50, a member country can only be removed from the EU two years after notification. While Britain might bypass this process through repeal of the European Communities Act of 1972, it is believed that this would make coming to a preferential trade agreement with the EU more difficult.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The findings of the seven-year inquiry, led by <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/the-inquiry/the-committee/sir-john-chilcot/">Sir John Chilcot</a> [official profile], into Britain's role in the <a href="/feature/featured/iraq-war/">invasion of Iraq</a> [JURIST backgrounder] were <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/the-inquiry/sir-john-chilcots-public-statement/">delivered</a> [statement] on Wednesday in the form of a scathing verdict against former prime minister <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tony-Blair">Tony Blair</a> [Britannica profile] and his administration, which stated that the war was based on "flawed intelligence and assessments" and had been launched before "peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted." More specifically, the <a href="http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/the-report/">Chilcot Inquiry</a> [report materials] concluded that the "judgements about the severity of the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction&#8212;WMD&#8212;were presented with a certainty that was not justified," "There was no imminent threat from Saddam Hussein," and "[t]he planning and preparations for Iraq after <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saddam-Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> [Britannica profile] were wholly inadequate." While stating that determination of whether the military action was legal is the prerogative of an international court, the inquiry concluded that "the circumstances in which it was decided that there was a legal basis for UK military action were far from satisfactory." Chilcot's statement reminded that a UN Security Council majority was lacking at the time of the invasion, and further concluded "that the UK was, in fact, undermining the Security Council's authority" by proceeding with military action. As for the post conflict period, Chilcot's statement concluded that, "[t]he Government's preparations failed to take account of the magnitude of the task of stabilising, administering and reconstructing Iraq, and of the responsibilities which were likely to fall to the UK." Stating that a vital purpose of the inquiry is to identify the lessons that can be learned from the Iraq experience including "management of relations with allies," Chilcot remarked that, "[t]he UK's relationship with the US has proved strong enough over time to bear the weight of honest disagreement. It does not require unconditional support where our interests or judgements differ."</p>

<p>The Iraq War has generated accusations of war crimes and atrocities, aimed at the different parties and countries involved in the conflict. On Saturday the <em>Telegraph</em> reported that the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/icc-will-not-prosecute-tony-blair-for-war-crimes-over-iraq-war.php">will not prosecute Tony Blair</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes in connection with the Iraq War. The "Chilcot Inquiry" into the Iraq War that began in July 2009. The inquiry's purpose has been to examine the period before the UK ended their troop presence in Iraq in 2009 and after the summer before the September 11 attacks in 2001. The inquiry's objective was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/04/chilcot-report-legality-of-iraq-war-was-never-part-of-inquiry-says-expert">never to answer</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] whether the Iraq War was legal. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Obama administration <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0506.aspx">imposed new sanctions</a> [press release] on North Korea on Wednesday, taking the unusual step of placing the country's leader Kim Jong Un and 10 other officials on a blacklist for human rights abusers. The sanctions would bar US individuals and businesses from dealing with Kim and the other officials named and would freeze any assets that they might have in the US. The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Department of Treasury</a> [official website] announcement was accompanied by a <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/259366.htm">congressionally mandated report</a> [text] from the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] on atrocities in North Korea. The report lists various forms of atrocities including sexual violence, deliberate starvation, severe beatings, forced abortions and secret executions. State Department spokesperson John Kirby <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/07/259384.htm">stated</a> [press statement] that "Human rights abuses in [North Korea] are among the worst in the world. ... The government continues to commit extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced labor, and torture." Kirby estimated that up to 120,000 people, including children, are held in North Korea's political prison camps. Warning that Kim is capable of resisting any pressure from these latest sanctions, Kirby expressed hope that "This puts them out in the domain in a way they wouldn't necessarily have been. ... There is a power in naming them."</p>

<p>This is the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/president-obama-issues-executive-order-sanctioning-north-korea.php">second time</a> [JURIST report] in less than four months that North Korea has been sanctioned by the US. These wave of sanctions from the US and UN, however, have appeared to have little effect. The <a href="http://nkdb.org/en/main.php">Database Center for North Korean Human Rights</a> (NKDB) [official website], a South Korean think-tank <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/rights-group-north-korea-not-making-improvements.php">reported in April</a> [JURIST report] that despite minor progress in certain areas, UN efforts at improving human rights in North Korea have not led to real improvement. North Korea has been an international source of concern due to the country's human rights record and instability.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdla">US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Louisiana</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdla/pr/united-states-attorney-announces-federal-criminal-investigation-death-alton-sterling">announced an investigation</a> [press release] into the recent police killing of a black man, Alton Sterling, which was recorded on video. Sterling was shot and killed by police officers Tuesday outside a Baton Rouge convenience store where he was selling CDs. US Attorney Walt Green said:<blockquote>The FBI's New Orleans Division, the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Louisiana have opened a civil rights investigation into the death of Alton Sterling. The Justice Department will collect all available facts and evidence and conduct a fair, thorough, and impartial investigation. As this is an ongoing investigation we are not able to comment further at this time.</blockquote> The killing, which was recorded on two separate videos, has sparked protests.</p>

<p>The killing comes amid a national conversation about police use of force, particularly against black citizens. In May  Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law an <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">amended hate crimes bill</a> [JURIST report], referred to as the "Blue Lives Matter" law, including police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected. The bill has drawn the contempt of some civil rights groups, including the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Earlier this year the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/san-francisco-police-under-doj-review.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the San Francisco Police Department following the shooting of an unarmed African American. In December an Ohio grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Earlier that month the DOJ announced that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/doj-to-open-investigation-into-chicago-police-department-after-shooting.php">opening a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Chicago Police Department following the 2014 police shooting death of a black teenager.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge in Buenos Aires froze the assets of former Argentinian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-12284208">Cristina Fernández de Kirchner</a> [BBC profile] Wednesday. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36731644">action comes</a> [BBC report] in association with the charge against de Kirchner for fraudulently manipulating the economy during her final months in office. Kirchner is charged with conspiring to sell USD $17 billion in futures contracts using an inflated dollar value for the country's own currency. Kirchner's crimes may be punishable by fiveto 20 years in prison. The judge, Claudio Bonadio, is a staunch opponent of Kirchner, and Kirchner claims that the charges against her are <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/former-argentinian-president-charged-for-manipulating-the-dollar-market.php">politically motivated</a> [JURIST report].      </p>

<p>Kirchner has recently been the subject of various corruption investigations. In May an Argentinian federal prosecutor made a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/argentina-prosecutor-urges-investigation-of-former-president-for-illegal-enrichment.php">formal request</a> [JURIST report] to a judge to conduct an investigation of Kirchner and her son for illegal enrichment in an ongoing money laundering investigation. Last year a judge in Argentina dismissed criminal allegations against Kirchner that accused her of conspiring to shield Iranian officials from responsibility for the 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires. Kirchner was <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/argentina-president-accused-of-cover-up-in-terrorist-attack.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of the cover up in January 2015. An appeals court in Argentina ruled in May 2014 that a controversial agreement between Argentina and Iran to investigate the 1994 <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/argentina-court-strikes-down-agreement-to-investigate-1994-bombing-of-jewish-community.php">bombing was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. The <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/argentina-iran-create-commission-to-investigate-1994-community-center-bombing.php">two nations signed</a> [JURIST report] the agreement in January 2013, which permitted Argentinian authorities to question the Iranian suspects under Interpol arrest warrants, but only in Tehran. In 2005 <a href="/paperchase/2005/07/argentina-admits-failure-in-jewish.php">Argentina accepted</a> [JURIST report] formal responsibility for its failure to discover who was behind the 1994 bombing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poland's Parliament approved a bill Thursday that would unblock the Constitutional Tribunal, which has been the subject of controversy since last year. The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/poland-rushes-vote-unblock-top-court-obama-arrives-40399866">measure was introduced</a> [AP report] by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) and passed 238-173 in the Sejm, the lower house of parliament. It will next proceed to the Senate, and then to President Andrzej Duda, who is expected to sign the bill into law. It is anticipated that the bill will pass before US President Obama and other world leaders arrive for a <a href="http://www.nato.int/">NATO</a> [official website] summit. While the measure has been seen as positive, opponents of the ruling party have cautioned that the bill is simply cosmetic. </p>

<p>The international <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/events/?lang=EN">Venice Commission</a>, a branch of the <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/home">Council of Europe</a> [official websites], <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/events/?id=2170">began an investigation</a> [press release] into Poland's recent changes to its Constitutional Court this past February. The EU is <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining the decision</a> regarding the Constitutional Court as well as new <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/poland-president-signs-bill-giving-government-control-of-media.php">media laws passed in January</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this year the Polish government passed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">controversial surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">grants the government</a> [press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. The PiS, a conservative party elected in October, holds an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34648575">overwhelming majority</a> [BBC report] of positions in the Polish government including the lead in both parliamentary houses and the presidency. Last December the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">rise to power in Poland to a coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">PiS has rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland. However, there is a larger concern in the EU that new Polish law will erode checks and balances on government powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian <a href="http://en.putin.kremlin.ru">President Vladimir Putin</a> [official website] signed a package of controversial <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/52489">anti-terror bills</a> [materials] on Thursday. These bills were drafted earlier this year as a response to the 2015 attacks in Paris and the bombing of an A-231 jet liner in Egypt. This package places high penalties on individuals found guilty of engaging in or financing terrorism including a possible sentence of life in prison for those engaging in international terrorism. Among several controversial alterations, the bill lowers the minimum age for being prosecuted for terrorist activities from 16 to 14. The bill also <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/52486">requires</a> [press release] communication companies to store client information for up to three years and record phone calls, messages, and transferred files for six months. Companies who fail to comply with these regulations face hefty monetary fines. Businesses have protested these changes arguing they are forced to bear the entire cost.</p>

<p>Many nations have passed controversial anti-terrorism laws in recent years. Last December China passed a new <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/china-passes-controversial-anti-terrorism-law.php">anti-terror law</a> [JURIST report] that requires technology companies to provide information to the government obtained from their products and make information systems "secure and controllable." In August 2015 Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/egypt-passes-sweeping-anti-terrorism-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 54-article counter-terrorism law, which has been met with significant controversy as many believe it to be an infringement on freedom of the press. Tunisia's parliament voted to approve a new <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/tunisia-parliament-approves-new-anti-terrorism-law.php">anti-terror law</a> [JURIST report] despite strong criticism from NGOs and human rights groups last July. In January 2015 Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/amnesty-calls-on-pakistan-to-end-executions.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to stop sentencing people for violation of the 1997 Anti-Terrorism Act, which they described as "so vague that almost all crimes fall under [its] definition." Nine bloggers were jailed in Ethiopia in April 2014 for violation of Ethiopia's broad <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/ethiopian-zone-9-bloggers-acquitted.php">anti-terrorism laws</a> [JURIST report], although five of them were acquitted the following October.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Germany adopts law expanding the definition of sex crimes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/">German parliament</a> [official website] unanimously passed a <a href="http://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/177.html">law</a> [law, PDF, german] Thursday expanding the definition of sex crimes, making any form of nonsensical sexual contact a crime. The new <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-women-law-idUSKCN0ZN135">"no means no" law</a> [Reuters report] protects victims of sexual attacks who withhold consent yet do not physically resist the attack. The old law required victims to physically resist in order to press charges. The legislation comes on the heels of a series of sexual assaults in the city of Cologne on New Year's Eve. On January 18, German officials arrested an Algerian refugee in connection with at least one of the 497 reported sexual assaults during New Years Eve, although the man was released and his <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/05/cologne-sex-attacks-trial-begins-160506115943135.html">charges were cleared</a> [Al Jazeera report] later in May. According to Heiko Maas, Germany's Justice Minister, only one in 10 rapes are reported in Germany and only 8 percent of rape trials result in conviction</p>

<p>Germany has attempted to crack down on sexual offenders before. In Germany, sexual offenders may request surgical castration as a treatment method. Although the <a href="http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/">Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane or Degrading Punishment</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/02/council-of-europe-publishes-report-on-german-castration-practices.php">objects</a> [JURIST report] to the practice noting: it has irreversible physical effects; surgical castration is not in conformity with recognized international standards; there is no guarantee the result sought will last and, given the context, free and informed consent is questionable. Germany and the Czech Republic are the only two European countries that allow sex offenders to choose surgical castration as a treatment options. Germany implemented the law in hopes of giving victims a voice and cracking down on sex-based crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.scc-csc.ca/home-accueil/index-eng.aspx">Supreme Court of Canada</a> on Thursday <a href="http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-l-csc-a/en/item/16059/index.do">rejected an appeal</a> [decision] by the <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/">Attorney General of Canada</a> [official website] asking the court to review a lower court decision instructing the country to reconsider revocation of a former-Nazi's Canadian citizenship. Helmut Oberlander, a 92-year-old Ukrainian man who claims he was forced to translate for the Ek 10a, a Nazi death squad, has had his citizenship revoked three times over the past 21 years, appealing the decision each time. While his initial appeals were dismissed and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration recommended to the Governor in Council that his citizenship be revoked due to his making a false representation or knowingly concealing material circumstances related to his involvement with Ek 10a, a federal court, in <a href="https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13184/index.do">Ezokola v. Canada</a> [decision], altered the requirements for complicity leading the <a href="http://cas-cdc-www02.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fca-caf_eng">Federal Court of Appeal</a> [official website] to instruct the Governor of Council to reconsider Oberlander's citizenship under the new understanding of complicity and duress.</p>

<p>The continued prosecution of Nazi party members has been an ongoing international concern. The US has designated that the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> <a href="http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007105">Office of Special Investigations</a> (OSI) [official websites] will handle cases aimed at denaturalizing or deporting former Nazis who participated in wartime persecutions. Over the past several years the US has questioned the citizenship of multiple suspected Nazi members and has begun criminal proceedings against many of them. <a href="/paperchase/2005/04/judge-strips-former-nazi-camp-guard-of.php">John Hansl</a> of Des Moines Iowa, <a href="/paperchase/2008/07/us-justice-department-continues-efforts.php">Peter Egner</a> of Washington, Anton Geiser of Pennsylvania, <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/sixth-circuit-dismisses-posthumous-citizenship-request-for-convicted-nazi-guard.php">John Demjanjuk</a> of Ohio, and <a href="/paperchase/2006/10/us-releases-former-nazi-guard-after.php">Johann Leprich</a> [JURIST reports] have all had their citizenship placed under investigation and most are in the midst of criminal investigation. The <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">2011 conviction</a> [JURIST report] of Demjanjuk in Germany may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/chinaend-relentless-repression-against-human-rights-lawyers-on-first-anniversary-of-crackdown/">urged</a> [AI report] Chinese authorities to "end their ruthless assault against human rights lawyers and activists." This call to Chinese officials comes just before the one-year anniversary of a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/08/china-list-of-lawyers-and-activists-targeted/">massive police crackdown</a> [AI press release] within the country, which led to the targeting of an estimated 248 activists and lawyers. Of those detained, 17 still remain in custody&#8212;the leading charge being "subverting state power." AI alleges that officials are holding activists without counsel or contact to anyone outside. AI has called this, "a clear violation of their rights." The organization also claims Chinese authorities are using the security of family members to hold against the activists.</p>

<p>In February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. Chinese state media recently criticized detained human rights lawyers for undermining the rule of law. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion. Also in January Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-china-unjustly-sentenced-human-rights-activists.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government to overturn a verdict sentencing three human rights activists in the Guangdong province to up to five years in prison. In December Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/prominent-china-rights-lawyer-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang after receiving a suspended sentence for "causing a disturbance" after he attended a weekend meeting that urged an investigation into the 1989 crackdown of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Democrats in Congress <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/07/lawmakers-seek-congressional-hearing-police-shootings/86826634/">called for hearings</a> [<em>USA Today</em> report] in the wake of police shootings of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/06/video-captures-white-baton-rouge-police-officer-fatally-shooting-black-man-sparking-outrage/">Alton Sterling</a> [WP report] and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/07/us/falcon-heights-shooting-minnesota/">Philando Castile</a> [CNN report], two black men, earlier this week. Congressman and House Judiciary Committee member, <a href="https://richmond.house.gov/">Cedric Richmond</a> [official website] from Louisiana, the state in which Alton Sterling was killed, stated:<blockquote>I'm not sure if legislation comes out, but hopefully a hearing will come out where we can talk to law enforcement, victims' families and other experts on how do we start preventing this and how do we better train our law enforcement officers on de-escalation tactics, on all the other alternatives to deadly force.</blockquote>Richmond and other lawmakers have been drafting legislation that would give victims' families the right to independent investigations, independent autopsies and an independent prosecutor. Much concern has been directed to <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/executives/comey">FBI Director James Comey</a> [official profile], asking him to get the current situation under control before civil unrest unfolds. Concerns of civil unrest have already been prophetic, as shooters <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-alton-sterling-protests/index.html">killed five police officers</a> [CNN report] and injured seven more and two civilians during a protest to the recent police shootings. Members of the <a href="https://cbc-butterfield.house.gov/">Congressional Black Caucus</a> [official website] have also made known their desire to meet with House Republican leaders, as well as Comey and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [official profile] to discuss the high rate of black men and women killed by police. Several high-profile democratic leaders have also <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/07/politics/alton-sterling-philando-castile-2016-election/">made statements</a> [CNN report] on the killings on social media, including presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p>

<p>The response to the recent shootings comes as national recognition of police use of deadly-force against black citizens increases. In May Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law an <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">amended hate crimes bill</a> [JURIST report], referred to as the "Blue Lives Matter" law, including police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected. The bill has drawn the contempt of some civil rights groups, including the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Earlier this year the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/san-francisco-police-under-doj-review.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the San Francisco Police Department following the shooting of an unarmed African American. In December an Ohio grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Earlier that month the DOJ announced that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/doj-to-open-investigation-into-chicago-police-department-after-shooting.php">opening a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Chicago Police Department following the 2014 police shooting death of a black teenager.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW: extrajudicial executions by police threaten security in Rio de Janeiro</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extrajudicial killings by police threaten over-all security in Rio de Janeiro, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] said in a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/07/good-cops-are-afraid/toll-unchecked-police-violence-rio-de-janeiro">109-page report</a> [materials] released Thursday. HRW says officials have "<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/07/brazil-extrajudicial-executions-undercut-rio-security">not done enough</a>" [press release] to address these executions ahead of the summer Olympics. An estimated 8,000 people have been killed by police in Rio de Janiero in the past decade&#8212;645 of those people in 2015 alone. While contending that officers in the state frequently encounter heavily-armed opposition, thus justifying the use of force at times, HRW claims that many other deaths were extrajudicial in nature. Through interviews with police in the region, HRW has said that many officers do not reporting the killings for fear of their own safety and the safety of their families. The state has taken steps to improve the situation, including creating a prosecutorial unit dealing exclusively with abuses by law enforcement. HRW urges the state to do more. </p>

<p>Police abuses have become a global issue in recent months. Earlier this week in the US Democrats in Congress <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/democrats-call-for-hearing-on-recent-police-shootings.php">called for hearings</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of police shootings of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/06/video-captures-white-baton-rouge-police-officer-fatally-shooting-black-man-sparking-outrage/">Alton Sterling</a> [WP report] and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/07/us/falcon-heights-shooting-minnesota/">Philando Castile</a> [CNN report], two black men. This same month in Kenya authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/kenya-police-officers-will-be-charged-with-murder-of-3-men.php">detained three police officers</a> [JURIST report] for their involvement in the murder of a human rights lawyer. In May the UN said that detainees in Sri Lanka are still <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-expert-sri-lanka-investigators-still-using-torture.php">experiencing torture</a> [JURIST report] as a tactic used by criminal and terrorism investigators seven years after the country's civil war ended. Those observations echo those of HRW, which reported in October that police forces in Sri Lanka <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hrw-sri-lanka-police-regularly-torture-suspects.php">regularly torture</a> [JURIST report] and mistreat criminal suspects in custody.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/hearing/hearing-demanding-accountability-administrations-reckless-release-terrorists-guantanamo/">hearing</a> [videos] on Thursday several Republican lawmakers questioned Obama administration officials in regards to the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees. In the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/transfer-policy-questioned-after-former-guantanamo-bay-detainee-goes-missing.html?_r=0">hearing</a> [NYT report], before the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">House Foreign Affairs committee</a> [official website], lawmakers claimed that the two administration officials have placed detainees in countries that do not have the necessary oversight capabilities, citing to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/us/disappearance-of-ex-guantanamo-bay-prisoner-raises-alarms.html">disappearance of former detainee</a> [NYT report], Jihad Diyab, who was sent to Uruguay in 2014. Early last month Diyab had stated that he would be unreachable by phone or e-mail due to a religious retreat he planned to attend and, soon after, Uruguayan officials reported that they had lost track of Diyab. Republican Represenative Ed Royce scolded <a href="http://www.state.gov/">State Department</a> [official website] special envoy for closing Guantanamo bay Lee Wolosky for providing "false assurances to Congress" in regards to Uruguay's promise to mitigate risks posed by the six detainees given to Uruguay. Wolosky stated that risks were mitigated, but they were not, and could not, be eliminated. Royce also questioned Paul Lewis, a member of the <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a>  (DOD)[official website], over intelligence reports on countries where detainees have been sent, stating that the reports show some countries were ill-equipped to handle the detainees. Lewis countered by saying that intelligence files were "one of many reports we look at" and assured Royce that any security faults were dealt with accordingly before release of detainees.</p>

<p>In February US President Obama delivered a plan to Congress to <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/obama-delivers-guantanamo-closure-plan-to-congress.php">close Guantanamo Bay</a> [JURIST report]. In November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. In April the DOD announced the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/dod-transfers-9-guantanamo-detainees-to-saudia-arabia.php">transfer</a> of nine detainees to Saudi Arabia and the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/2-guantanamo-detainees-transferred-to-senegal.php">transfer</a> [JURIST report] of two more detainees to Senegal. Libyan nationals Salem Abdu Salam Ghereby, 55, and Omar Khalif Mohammed Abu Baker Mahjour, about 44, were released after being held nearly 14 years without charges.The DOD <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">said</a> [JURIST report] last year they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 presidential executive order to review the status of all detainees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://malegislature.gov/">Massachusetts Legislature</a> on Thursday sent a transgender anti-discrimination bill to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/governor/">Governor Charlie Baker</a> [official website]. The <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">bill</a> [text, PDF], which many believe will be signed into law, will <a href="http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/07/legislature_sends_transgender.html">provide protections</a> [MassLive report] to transgender people in places of public accommodation including public restrooms, restaurants and public transit, so long as they have a sincerely held gender identity and are not using their gender identity for improper reasons. The governor was previously against signing off on such a change, though he has since shown support for the law with inclusion of language directing the attorney general to provide guidance as to what legal action can brought for those using gender identity for an "improper purpose." If passed, the law will take effect on October 1, after the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/mcad/">Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination</a> and the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/">Attorney General</a> [official websites] create appropriate regulatory guidelines, due by September 1.</p>

<p>Transgender access to public restrooms has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. In May the Obama administration issued guidance to schools on ensuring "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment," prompting a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by 11 states. Also in May the Florida American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-florida-school-districts-bathroom-gender-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Marion County school district, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/parliament/">Irish Parliament</a> on Thursday defeated a bill that would have allowed abortion in Ireland where the child would not survive outside of the womb. <a href="http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Taoiseach_and_Government/About_the_Taoiseach/">Prime Minister Enda Kenny</a> [official profile] had been open about his <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/irish-parliament-rejects-limited-abortion-bill-153927175.html">opposition</a> [AFP report] to the bill, calling it "bad for women and medically inadequate," and instructed his Fine Gael party members to vote against the bill. The bill was defeated in a 95-45 vote. Mike Wallace, the bill's proponent, stated that he wanted the bill's constitutionality under the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1983/ca/8/enacted/en/print">Eighth Amendment</a> [materials] tested in the country's <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ie/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. All abortions are illegal in Ireland, except where there is a "real and substantial risk to the life of the mother," and any woman having an illegal abortion can be sentenced up to 14 years in prison. Due to these restrictions, women in Ireland have taken to traveling to England to have abortions. The vote comes after the UN issued a statement last month that an Irish woman suffered <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ireland-woman-faced-inhuman-treatment-while-seeking-abortion.php">"inhuman treatment"</a> [JURIST report] while seeking an abortion.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/reproductive-rights/">Abortion access and reproductive healthcare</a> [JURIST backgrounder] remain contentious issues worldwide. In April Polish citizens protested a possible <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/poland-citizens-protest-proposed-abortion-ban.php">total abortion ban</a> [JURIST report] following the suggestion of the ruling legislative party's president. The ruling conservative Law and Justice party wanted to bring the country's abortion policies in line with the Catholic Church's views on the practice. The High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland in November <a href="https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2015/%5B2015%5D%20NIQB%2096/j_j_HOR9740Final.htm">ruled</a> [judgment] that Northern Ireland's abortion laws, which only allow abortion when the mother faces the risk of death or serious injury, are a <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/northern-ireland-court-restrictive-abortion-laws-violate-human-rights.php">violation of human rights</a> [JURIST report]. According to an Amnesty International report released the same month, El Salvador's complete ban on abortion <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/amnesty-el-salvador-abortion-law-breeding-atmosphere-of-fear.php">negatively affects</a> [JURIST report] not only women and girls, but also their families. A Dominican court in December <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/dominican-republic-high-court-restores-total-abortion-ban.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a new law that would have decriminalized abortion if a pregnant woman's life was at risk, thus reinstating a total ban on abortion within the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/MDE1541992016ENGLISH.PDF">report</a> [news report, PDF] issued on Thursday, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called upon Palestinian and Israeli officials to properly address human rights violations committed by their forces. The report was released a day before the second anniversary of Operation Protective Edge, a 50-day military offensive by Israel in Gaza, and features interviews from relatives of those killed, discusses flaws in ongoing investigations by both sides, and documents several attacks directed at civilians in violation of international laws. The report discusses Palestinian officials' failure to seriously investigate violations by Hamas and Palestinian armed groups, "abducting, torturing and unlawfully killing Palestinians" suspected of "collaborating" with Israel and launching "thousands of unguided rockets and mortars towards Israel, often directing them towards civilian areas" respectively. The report also addresses similar failures by Israeli officials to conduct sufficient military investigations, having only brought charges against three soldiers for minor abuses despite far more severe war crimes having been committed, and ignored. AI, in its report, urged all parties involved to conduct substantial and transparent investigations into the war crimes, such as would comply with international standards, and asked for their support in the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] preliminary examination into the matter.</p>

<p>The increase in violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created a contentious human rights situation. The UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">released</a> [JURIST report] closing remarks to its fifty-seventh session in May, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. An Israeli court in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to a 50-day war in Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/PS/Pages/MakarimWibisono.aspx">Makarim Wibisono</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory after repeated requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] British <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/people/david-cameron">Prime Minister David Cameron</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ban-on-women-in-ground-close-combat-roles-lifted">lifted</a> [press release] a ban on women serving in close combat units in British military. In what Cameron called a "major step," women will now be allowed to serve in cavalry, infantry and armored corps roles in the military, making British armed forces "reflect the society we live in." Women will slowly be integrated into the different combat roles, starting with the Calvary, then to the armored units, finally being integrated into the infantry. Cameron's decision to lift the ban was supported by the recommendation of the head of the Army, General Sir Nick Carter, as well as an "Interim Health Report" detailing "three keys areas of potential risk to women on the front line: musculoskeletal injury, psychological issues and impaired reproductive health." There is still opposition by some claiming that women may not be able to meet the physical requirements necessary for a close combat position. According to recent British Army research, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36746917">less than 5 percent</a> [BBC report] of the women currently in the military would satisfy the physical requirements.</p>

<p>Following the US, which <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/us-military-to-permit-women-to-serve-in-combat-units.php">stated</a> that it would allow women to serve in combat roles in the military, Cameron makes good on his <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3367433/Cameron-send-women-soldiers-close-combat-time-despite-brass-warnings-female-fighters-damage-warrior-ethos.html">promise</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] in December 2015 that women would be permitted to serve in close combat roles within 12 months. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a 63-30 vote, the <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">US Senate</a> [official website] approved <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/764">legislation</a> [materials] Thursday requiring food packaging to display genetically-modified organism (GMO) contents using words, pictures or scannable bar codes. If passed in the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House</a> [official website], this law would stand as a national standard for displaying GMO contents and replace all state-based GMO packaging laws, including more stringent laws in states like Vermont. The law stipulates the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">US Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website] will decide which ingredients will constitute being genetically modified. This provision has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-food-gmo-vote-idUSKCN0ZO08N">raised concerns</a> [Reuters article] from groups, including the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">US Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) [official website], in particular because some ingredients, including beet sugar and soybean, can be genetically modified but contain little to no genetic material after being processed and so would not fall within the scope of the legislation. However, the USDA was adamant that it would include these and other similar ingredients in its list of GMOs. Others, including Senator Bernie Sanders, expressed concerns that the law is too ambiguous and will lead to confusion. The food industry, though generally a proponent of GMOs, is more accepting of a uniform national standard as opposed to state-based regulations.</p>

<p>GMO labeling has been a cause for concern in the US. In February 2014 US President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/07/remarks-president-signing-farm-bill-mi">signed into law</a> [press release] a $956 billion <a href="http://agriculture.house.gov/sites/republicans.agriculture.house.gov/files/pdf/legislation/agriculturalact2014.pdf">farm bill</a> [text, PDF] providing expanded crop insurance and other benefits for the agricultural sector and also requiring changes in food labeling. The recent prevalence of GMO crops has been a point of contention in courts around the world. In May 2014 Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/vermont-governor-signs-bill-requiring-labels-on-gmo-foods.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring the labeling of food containing GMOs. In May 2013 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-for-monsanto-in-seed-patent-dispute.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bowman-v-monsanto-co/">Bowman v. Monsanto</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a farmer who buys patented seeds may not reproduce them through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission, even though the seeds are altered to self-replicate. In March 2011 the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ecj-legal-adviser-finds-ban-on-genetically-modified-crops-illegal.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that a ban on cultivating GMO crops is illegal after France attempted to prohibit the production of a strain of genetically modified maize developed by Monsanto in 2008. In December 2010 a US federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-orders-destruction-of-genetically-engineered-plants.php">ordered the destruction</a> [JURIST report] of a crop of genetically engineered sugar beets due to its potential harmful effect on surrounding flora.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Congresswoman Corrine Brown and her chief of staff Elias "Ronnie" Simmons were charged in a 24-count <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/file/874106/download">indictment</a> [indictment, PDF] unsealed Friday for involvement in a bogus non-profit scholarship entity. Among the charges are multiple counts of mail and wire fraud, theft of government property, concealing materials facts on required financial disclosure forms, and filing false tax returns. After the announcement was made on Friday, Assistant Attorney General Caldwell <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/congresswoman-corrine-brown-and-chief-staff-charged-fraud-scheme-involving-bogus-non">stated</a> [press release] that Brown and Simmons had "solicit[ed] over $800,000 in donations to a supposed charitable organization only to use the organization as a personal slush fund." The alleged non-profit scholarship fund, called One Door for Education - Amy Anderson Scholarship Fund (One Door), primarily received donations from individuals and corporate entities the two had dealt with due to Brown's position in the House of Representatives. According to the indictment, only two scholarships totaling $1,200 were given to students for attending school and related costs. Simmons was charged with theft of government property for acquiring congressional employment for a relative and that relative having received $735,000 in government salary despite performing no work for the US House of Representatives. Simmons is also alleged to have diverted more than $80,000 of his relatives salary for personal use. The president of One Door Carla Wiley <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/file/874081/download">pleaded guilty</a> [plea agreement, PDF] for her involvement in the fraudulent scheme earlier this year.</p>

<p>Brown has been a staunch challenger of Florida voting laws negatively affecting minorities. In April of this year Brown <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-court-refuses-to-alter-florida-congressional-district-boundaries.php">challenged</a> [JURIST report] Florida's current congressional district boundaries, arguing unsuccessfully that the law diminished the rights of minorities. The congressional districts were upheld by a three-judge panel. In 2012 Brown had <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-florida-early-voting-law-amendment.php">previously challenged</a> an early voting law in federal court. That court also ruled against Brown, holding that voters did not need to be provided 96 hours of early voting for November elections, despite claims by Brown and other African American leaders that the amendments to Florida's previous early voting law were enacted "with the intent to discriminate against minority voters, or...operates to deny or abridge African American's right to vote on account of their race." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a <a href="http://time.com/4398650/dallas-shooting-loretta-lynch-remarks/">press conference</a> [video] held Friday in Washington, DC, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/meet-attorney-general">Attorney General Loretta Lynch</a> [official website] gave her response to the shooting of police in Dallas during a peaceful protest of recent police shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castille. Lynch gave her thoughts and condolences to those affected by the recent tragedies and stated that the Department of Justice, including the FBI, ATF, and US Marshals Service and US Attorneys Office were conducting an investigation into the Dallas shooting. She also stated a civil rights investigation has been opened in the Sterling case, while assistance is being provided to local authorities in Minnesota as they investigate the Castille shooting. Lynch acknowledged that some Americans may be feeling a "sense of helplessness, of uncertainty, and of fear," but she stood firm in saying that "the answer must not be violence. The answer is never violence." Lynch also briefly touched upon gun control in the country, stating "we must take a hard look at the ease with which wrongdoers can get their hands on deadly weapons and the frequency with which they use them." Finishing her press conference, Lynch urged American citizens to stand together as one nation and prevent hatred from precipitating any further violent acts.</p>

<p>The response to the recent shootings comes as national recognition of police use of deadly-force against black citizens increases. In May Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law an <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">amended hate crimes bill</a> [JURIST report], referred to as the "Blue Lives Matter" law, including police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected. The bill has drawn the contempt of some civil rights groups, including the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Earlier this year the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/san-francisco-police-under-doj-review.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the San Francisco Police Department following the shooting of an unarmed African American. In December an Ohio grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Earlier that month the DOJ announced that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/doj-to-open-investigation-into-chicago-police-department-after-shooting.php">opening a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Chicago Police Department following the 2014 police shooting death of a black teenager.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ten additional states, including Nebraska, Michigan and Ohio, have filed a <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIAG/2016/07/08/file_attachments/583017/Title%2B%2BIV%2BComplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] against the Obama administration for its directive for schools to allow transgender to use the restroom correlating to their gender identity. The Obama administration, through the Department of Education (DOE) and Department of Justice (DOJ), previously issued a letter informing states that transgender people are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, dealing with employment, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, handling federally funded schools. Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson contends that the agencies bypassed necessary procedures in creating new federal regulations. The lawsuit asks for a temporary injunction on enforcing transgender use of restrooms intended by the administration pending the outcome of the lawsuit. A similar lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">brought</a> [JURIST report] earlier in May by 11 states.</p>

<p>Transgender access to public restrooms has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. Earlier this week the Massachusetts legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/massachusetts-legislature-sends-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill-to-governor.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill set to stop discrimination of transgender citizens in places of public accommodation, including public restrooms. In May the Florida American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-florida-school-districts-bathroom-gender-policy.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Marion County school district, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gambia and Tanzania announced the end of the practice of child marriage along with prison sentences for those who continue the tradition. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-24383225">Gambian President Yahya Jemmah</a> [BBC profile] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.enca.com/africa/child-marriage-banned-in-gambia">announced</a> [eNCA report] that "[a]s from today, July 6, child marriage is illegal and is banned in The Gambia." He also <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3680787/Gambia-ban-child-marriage-spark-backlash-activist-fears.html">announced</a> [Daily Mail report] the penalties from violating the practice are steep. The adult spouse will spend 20 years in jail, the parents will spend 21 years in jail, and those who know about child marriage but fail to do anything about it will spend 10 years in jail. He then instructed the Gambian congress to pass a bill by July 21 to outlaw the practice. On Friday, the <a href="http://www.judiciary.go.tz/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1">Tanzanian High Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/08/dispatches-tanzanian-high-court-rules-against-child-marriage">ruled</a> [HRW report] child marriage was illegal by ruling provisions of the Tanzania Law of Marriage Act unconstitutional. The ruling makes any marriage by anyone under the age of 18 in the country illegal, even with parental consent.  </p>

<p>In recent years, the practice of child marriage has been criticized in many areas of the world. In November, The Guatemalan Congress <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/guatemala-raises-marriage-age-to-18.php">approved legislation</a> [JURIST report] to raise to legal age for marriage to 18. In April of last year Malawi <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-welcomes-malawi-marriage-act.php">raised the minimum marriage age to 18</a> [JURIST report] for both boys and girls. The move came after HRW called on Malawi <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/hrw-calls-on-malawi-to-end-childhood-marriage.php">to end the practice</a>, [JURIST report] detailing how child marriage exposes girls to domestic and sexual violence. In 2014, Bangladeshi officials <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/bangladesh-officials-approve-child-marriage-prevention-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the Child Marriage Prevention Act of 2014, requiring a two-year jail term for any person who marries a girl under the age of 18.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Massachusetts <a href="http://www.mass.gov/governor/">Governor Charlie Baker</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.mass.gov/governor/press-office/press-releases/fy2017/governor-signs-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill.html">signed</a> [press release] a <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/Senate/S2407">bill</a> (S.2407) [text] into law on Friday protecting against discrimination on the basis of gender identity. The bill was <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/massachusetts-legislature-sends-transgender-anti-discrimination-bill-to-governor.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] earlier in the week by both houses of the state legislature and has been praised as a compromise between anti-discrimination and public safety. The law requires places of public accommodation such as bathrooms to allow the use of those places based on one's sincerely held gender identity. Additionally, the public safety concerns raised by some were addressed through a portion of the law putting the state <a href="http://www.mass.gov/ago/">Attorney General's Office</a> [official website] in charge of issuing guidance for reporting any improper assertions of gender identity. After signing the bill Governor Baker stated, "No one should be discriminated against in Massachusetts because of their gender identity." The law will take effect on October 1, after the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/mcad/">Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination</a> [official website] and the Attorney General create appropriate regulatory guidelines, due by September 1.</p>

<p>Transgender access to public restrooms has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. Also Friday, ten states <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ten-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-bathroom-guidance.php">announced a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Obama administration for its directive for schools to allow transgender to use the restroom correlating to their gender identity. In May the Obama administration issued the guidance to schools on ensuring "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment," prompting a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">similar lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] by 11 states. Also in May the Florida American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/aclu-challenges-florida-school-districts-bathroom-gender-policy.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the Marion County school district, challenging their bathroom policy as anti-transgender. The US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/doj-files-complaint-challenging-north-carolina-hb2.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in May challenging North Carolina's controversial House Bill 2.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The claim involved <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=1&p=1&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=6,006,227.PN.&OS=pn/6,006,227&RS=PN/6,006,227">U.S. Patent No. 6,006,227</a> (227 Patent) [text], a "document stream operating system" that organizes files chronologically. The original claim involved multiple patents and proceeded to a jury trial in which Mirror Worlds, a subsidiary of Network-1, was awarded $625 million. This award was later overturned, prompting the instant claim also filed by Mirror Worlds regarding only the 227 Patent. The settlement includes more than a payout; Apple will now have a nonexclusive and fully-paid license to use the technology, as well as license to use some of Network-1's other technologies.</p>

<p>Apple has recently been involved in numerous patent infringement battles. In June the Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/apple-ordered-to-stop-sale-of-iphone6-and-iphone-6-plus-in-beijing.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Apple to stop sale of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Beijing due to claims by Chinese regulators that Apple Inc. violated a patent held by a Chinese company. In April Apple agreed to pay $24.9 million to Dynamic Advances and parent company Marathon Patent Group to settle a 2012 <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/apple-agrees-to-settle-siri-lawsuit-for-249-million.php">patent lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] concerning Apple's voice-controlled interface, Siri. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-to-hear-samsung-appeal-against-apple.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in March that it will hear Samsung's appeal against Apple regarding Apple's 2012 victory in a patent dispute. Also in March the <a href="http://www.lg-duesseldorf.nrw.de/behoerde/index.php">Dusseldorf District Court</a> [official website, in German] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/german-court-rules-against-apple-for-violating-streaming-patent.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Apple products infringe upon video streaming patents belonging to the Kudeleski Group, a Swiss security company.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Pakistan <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk/index.php">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> [official website] on Saturday <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.pk/pr-details.php?mm=MzkyNg,,">accused</a> [press release] India of human rights violations after a recent clash between the Indian army and rebels in Kashmir. On Friday, rebels <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36758319">engaged</a> [BBC report] in a firefight with soldiers as part of their ongoing campaign to achieve Kashmir's independence from India. The firefight left 200 injured and 16 dead including Burhan Wani, the militant commander of major rebel group <a href="http://hizbmedia.org/Introduction.php">Hizbul Mujahideen</a> [official website]. After Burhan Wani's funeral was held on Saturday, the violence continued with attacks against police stations and military installations. In response, Pakistan has <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pakistan-accuses-india-of-rights-violations-in-kashmir-hizbul-mujahideen-burhan-wani-2905204/">called on</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report] the Indian government to prevent further violence by respecting human rights and recognizing the Kashmiris' right of self-determination. Furthermore, Pakistan has urged India to abide by its obligations under the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/">United Nations Security Council Resolutions</a> (UNSCR) [materials]. It is expected that the violence will only worsen should growing tensions in Kashmir not be resolved.</p>

<p>The Delhi High Court in India <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/india-student-leader-charged-with-sedition-granted-bail.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST report] in March to a student political leader arrested for rallying against the execution of Kashmiri separatist Mohammed Afzal Guru. The government justified the arrests of rallying students on the grounds that they supported the Kashmiri separatist movement and the break-up of India. In October 2014, Pakistan asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/pakistan-asks-un-for-border-protection.php">assistance in border protection</a> [JURIST report] after at least 14 people were shot and killed near Kashmir. In June 2015 independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-experts-pakistan-must-pass-measures-to-protect-minorities.php">urged </a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to adopt urgent legislation to put an end to faith-based killings and protect the country's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8711026.stm">Ahmadiyya Muslim</a> [BBC profile] community.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UK government on Friday rejected a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215">petition</a> [official petition website] calling for a second referendum vote to prevent the UK from leaving the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website]. The petition achieved 4.1 million signatures, surpassing the 100,000 signature threshold which obligates the UK government to respond. The petition <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215">argued</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887">vote to leave the EU</a> [BBC backgrounder] did not achieve a 60 percent majority nor a 75 percent turnout. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office">Foreign Ministry</a> [official website] responded via email that the <a href="http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/europeanunionreferendum.html">European Union Referendum Act</a> [materials], as agreed upon by Parliament, states no such threshold requirements. The government response further stressed that the referendum was a "once in a generation" vote and that the government must honor the majority's decision and prepare for the UK's exit from the EU. While the petition may be scheduled for a debate, the <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/petitions-committee">Petitions Committee</a> [official website] has stated that such a debate could only take place in <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/building/palace/westminsterhall/">Westminster Hall</a> [official website] and would not have the power of law to actually trigger a second referendum. A decision on the petition has been postponed until July 12 due to an investigation into the petition's rising number of discovered fraudulent signatures. </p>

<p>A majority of British citizens voted to <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">leave</a> [JURIST report] the EU last month. Concern over the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZB090">economic health of Britain</a> [<em>Reuters</em> report] going into the future led to a global market plunge following the vote, as the pound fell as far as 10 percent against the US dollar&#8212;a low not seen since 1985. While the vote has fallen in favor of departure, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/legal-implications-britain-votes-leave-eu-brexit">no legal changes have taken place yet</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report], as Britain must take further steps to confirm its separation. However, Britain's leading public-interest law firm as well as several experienced litigators are currently <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/uk-lawyers-to-challenge-eu-referendum.php">drafting</a> [JURIST report] a legal challenge to at least trigger a parliamentary debate. The EU has set out a mechanism for leaving in <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html">Article 50</a> [text] of the Lisbon Treaty, where a member state "may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements," and "must notify the European council of its intention." Under Article 50, a member country can only be removed from the EU two years after notification. While Britain might bypass this process through repeal of the European Communities Act of 1972, it is believed that this would make coming to a preferential trade agreement with the EU more difficult.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/832874/detainee-transfers-announced">announced the transfer</a> [press release] of two Guantanamo detainees to Serbia. Yemeni detainee Mansur Ahmad Saad al-Dayfi and Tajik detainee Muhammadi Davlatov were transferred to Serbia after extensive review. The transfers come after Sunday's announcement that Yemeni Guantanamo detainee Fayiz Ahmad Yahia Suleiman had been <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/832604/detainee-transfer-announced">transferred to Italy</a> [press release]. The US government expressed gratitude to the governments of Italy and Serbia for their willingness to accept the detainees and aid in the ongoing effort to close the Guantanamo prison facility. These transfer bring the total number of detainees at Guantanamo to 76.</p>

<p>Last week Republican lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/republicans-question-transfer-of-low-level-guantanamo-bay-detainees.php">questioned</a> [JURIST report] Obama administration officials about the transfer of detainees following the disappearance of a former detainee transferred to Uruguay.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ivory Coast government should make greater efforts to prevent and punish rape, according to a <a href="http://ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/CI/2016-07-11_Rapport_viols_Cote_dIvoire.docx">report</a> [text, DOC, in French; <a href="http://ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/CI/2016-07-11_Summary_Recommendations_Cote_dIvoire_EN.docx">summary</a>, DOC] released Monday by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unoci/">UN Operation in the Ivory Coast</a> (UNOCI) and the <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites]. The agencies examined data from 2012-2015, documenting 1,129 cases of rape and finding that 66 percent of victims were children. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said, "Côte d'Ivoire in recent years has recorded significant progress in terms of human rights, but the persistence of rape and impunity towards their perpetrators remain of serious concern and requires urgent action." The report made several recommendations, including revision of the criminal code to define rape and other sexual offenses and providing victims with access to legal aid.</p>

<p>The Ivory Coast has faced turmoil since 2010 when former president <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12933023">Laurent Gbagbo</a> [BBC profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=gbagbo">news archive</a>] an for reelection against former prime minister <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12934834">Alassane Ouattara</a> [BBC profile]. The EU recognized that Ouattara defeated Gbagbo, but Gbagbo refused to concede victory. Gbagbo has been <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-rights-expert-victims-of-ivory-coast-election-violence-must-not-be-forgotten.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of starting a civil war after losing the presidency, which resulted in 3,000 deaths and one million people displaced. Gbagbo is currently facing trial before the International Criminal Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/IDPersonsIndex.aspx">Chaloka Beyani</a> [official profile], UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20256&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press release] recent attacks on IDPs and civilians in South Sudan Monday. Renewed violence in the capital city of Juba has resulted in the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54434#.V4Qkolepouk">deaths</a> [UN News Centre report] of two Chinese UN Peacekeepers, one UN national staff member and two IDPs. Beyani expressed concern at the violence that has already displaced 30,000 people in addition to the newly displaced 10,000 people in Juba. He urged the authorities to respect the broken peace agreement and called upon the parties to abide by international humanitarian law and protect civilians "in times of armed conflict." Amid the clashes between the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the SPLA in Opposition, Beyani reminded the parties that threats and attacks against humanitarian staff and the UN Mission in South Sudan are unacceptable and called on them to cease immediate acts of aggression. The Special Rapporteur lamented that the country had marked its fifth anniversary of independence "with gunfire instead of celebration."</p>

<p>Human rights concerns have been widespread concerning South Sudan. In June UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] shock at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries, including South Sudan. In May Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-south-sudan-detainees-held-in-inhumane-conditions.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that dozens of detainees in South Sudan are being held in inhumane conditions. In April six human rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/rights-groups-next-un-chief-must-stand-up-for-human-rights.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the next UN Secretary-General to do everything he or she can do to protect innocent civilians whose nation faced armed conflict, including South Sudan. In March the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-council-establishes-three-person-investigative-commission-in-south-sudan.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in South Sudan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Monday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/11/saudi-coalition-airstrikes-target-civilian-factories-yemen">urged</a> [press release] Saudi Arabia and other coalition members to create an independent international inquiry into their attacks on civilian economic structures in Yemen. HRW cited its <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/10/bombing-businesses/saudi-coalition-airstrikes-yemens-civilian-economic-structures">report</a> [textt], "Bombing Businesses: Saudi Coalition Airstrikes on Yemen's Civilian Economic Structures," stating that airstrikes have killed 130 and injured 171 civilians and destroyed factories, commercial warehouses, a farm and two power facilities. The human rights organization concluded that the airstrikes on civilian economic structures have shattered Yemen's economy and that the strikes were intended to unlawfully do so. HRW also called on Saudi Arabia to be suspended from membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) until it "ceases unlawful strikes and either conducts investigations that meeter national standards or agrees to an independent international inquiry." HRW <a href="http://www.sabanews.net/en/news433117.htm">said</a> [Yemen News Agency report] that Saudi Arabia and its allies have violated international humanitarian law and are "considered war crimes" through the raids against Yemen.</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. Last month Amnesty International (AI) and HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/ai-and-hrw-issue-joint-call-for-suspension-of-saudi-arabia-from-un-human-rights-council.php">issued a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] calling for the removal of Saudi Arabia from the UNHRC. Also last month the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-office-condemns-attacks-in-residential-areas-of-yemen.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a string of rocket and mortar attacks against residential areas and markets in Yemen. In May a UN Envoy for Yemen <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-yemen-peace-talks-moving-forward.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that peace negotiations between Yemeni parties in Kuwait were off to an "encouraging start that will set the ground for a negotiated solution." In April the UN Envoy for Yemen <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/UN-envoy-hopeful-about-peaceful-resolution-to-Yemen-conflict.php">told</a> [JURIST report] the UN Security Council that Yemen was at a "critical crossroads" as peace talks between the government and Houthis were scheduled to begin the following week.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Israeli and American citizens filed a <a href="http://https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6777103/Facebook_trial_NY.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] on Monday seeking $1 billion in damages from <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/">Facebook</a> [corporate website] for allegedly facilitating in Palestinian military attacks. The plaintiffs are relatives of victims who died in attack in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the West Bank between 2014 and 2016. They are <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-facebook-idUKKCN0ZR1G0">accusing</a> [Reuters report] Facebook of assisting in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13331522">Hamas</a> [BBC profile] militants' operations. The complaint contends that Facebook "knowingly provided material support and resources to Hamas ... facilitating this terrorist group's ability to communicate, recruit members, plan and carry out attacks, and strike fear in its enemies." This lawsuit follows comments made by <a href="http://mops.gov.il/english">Israel's security minister</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-facebook-idUSKCN0ZI0XB">discussing</a> [Reuters report] Facebook's reluctance to help track potential Palestinian militants.</p>

<p>Facebook has faced numerous legal challenges across the globe. In January Germany's Federal Court of Justice <a href="http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&Art=en&Datum=Aktuell&Sort=12288&nr=73328&linked=pm&Blank=1">ruled</a> [press release, in German] that Facebook's <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/germany-top-court-rules-facebook-friend-finder-tool-unlawful.php">friend finder feature is unlawful</a> [JURIST report]. In October the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/eu-court-rules-transfer-of-user-data-violates-privacy-laws.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US by various technology companies, including Facebook, is not sufficiently protected. In December 2014 Facebook <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/facebook-faces-lawsuit-alleging-violation-of-privacy.php">failed to dismiss a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] that claimed it scanned users' private messages for the names of websites for targeted advertising purposes. In May 2014 an Iranian judge <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/iran-judge-orders-facebook-ceo-to-appear-in-court.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear in court regarding allegation that certain Facebook apps violated user privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>HRW: Turkey preventing independent investigation into mass abuses against civilians</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Turkish government is blocking access for independent investigations, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocate website] said in a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/11/turkey-state-blocks-probes-southeast-killings">report</a> [text] released Monday. HRW claims that the Turkish government is abusing civilians on a massive scale and attempting to cover it up. These alleged abuses include "unlawful killings of civilians, mass forced civilian displacement, and widespread unlawful destruction of property." HRW reviewed lists of the dead compiled in numerous attacks which show as many as 66 residents, including 11 children, killed by gunfire or mortal explosions during <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17994865">Turkish government</a> [BBC profile] security operations. Witness accounts claim that Turkish forces opened fire on civilians on the streets carrying white flags. HRW also documented widespread property destruction during many of the military operations. The Turkish government has not responded to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/SP/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19937&LangID=E">public statement</a> [press release] from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] or its request for permission for a UN team to conduct an investigation within the region.</p>

<p>Turkey and its treatment of human rights are cause for concern due to the growing partnership with the EU caused by the refugee crisis. EU leaders <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-turkey-reach-deal-on-returning-migrants.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to a deal with Turkey in March to stem migrant flows, particularly of Syrian refugees, to Europe in return for financial and political incentive to Ankara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/turkey-eu-violating-international-law-by-breaking-migrant-pact.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that EU states are violating international law by breaking their migrant pact with Turkey by not allowing the country to extradite suspected terrorists. In April the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muižnieks, called on Turkey to <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-official-warns-turkish-government-antiterrorism-security-measures-harming-human-rights.php">focus on human rights</a> [JURIST report] in the wake of their anti-terrorism security measures. Also in April Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/amnesty-turkey-forcibly-returning-syria-refugees.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey has been forcibly returning up to 100 refugees to Syria per day and expressed concern for the possible future of transported migrants.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> (PCA) [official website] in The Hague <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Award.pdf">ruled</a> [award, PDF; <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Press-Release-No-11-English.pdf">press release</a>, PDF] in favor of the Philippines Tuesday in a dispute with China over most of the South China Sea. The Philippines brought a case against China in 2013 disputing the latter's territorial claims. The PCA concluded that China does not have the right to resources within its "nine-dash line." The ruling is considered a win for the Philippines and could raise tensions in the area. China has long <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-to-ignore-un-ruling-concerning-the-south-china-sea.php">disputed</a> [JURIST report] the PCA's jurisdiction over the matter and has rejected the ruling.</p>

<p>Territorial disputes over the South China Sea have been an <a href="/forum/2012/10/michael-kelly-china-unclos.php">ongoing source of tension</a> [JURIST op-ed] between China and its neighboring countries. China claims nearly the entire 3.5 million square-kilometer South China Sea, a region believed to be rich in oil and minerals. China has come into territorial conflict over the region in the past, not only <a href="/sidebar/2011/07/edsel-tupaz-spratlys-dispute.php">with the Philippines</a> [JURIST op-ed], but also with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippines and China were <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/07/201273093650328417.html">involved in a two-month standoff</a> [Al Jazeera report] in 2012 around the Scarborough Shoal, a small cluster of uninhabitable islands 220 km off the coast of the Philippines, which, according to international maritime law, fall into the Philippines' economic zone. The standoff was triggered when Chinese vessels blocked the Philippine navy from arresting Chinese fishermen for alleged illegal fishing activities within the Philippines' exclusive economic zones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] North Carolina <a href="http://governor.nc.gov">Governor Pat McCrory</a> [official profile] on Monday signed into law <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2015/Bills/House/HTML/H972v7.html">House Bill 972</a> [text], which states that police camera footage, including body camera footage, is not a matter of public record and proscribes the procedure for release of footage. While members of the public are allowed to request the footage if they meet certain criteria, such as being filmed in the footage or the "personal representative" of someone in the footage, their requests can still be denied and the footage will only be released following a court order. Organizations like the <a href="https://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] have <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/blog/gov-mccrory-signs-bill-that-keeps-police-camera-footage-secret.html">spoken out against the law</a> [press release], stating that "[b]ody cameras should be a tool to make law enforcement more transparent and accountable to the communities they serve but this shameful law will make it nearly impossible to achieve those goals."</p>

<p>Policing incidents related to body cameras and racial profiling have been a highly contested issue since the Ferguson, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28841715">Missouri shooting</a> [BBC report] in 2014 and rekindled by the recent killings of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/us/philando-castile-minnesota-police-shooting.html?_r=0">African-American men by police</a> [NYT report; Huffington Post <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alton-sterling-video_us_577c78e7e4b09b4c43c18f1b">report</a>]. Last year, Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/illinois-governor-signs-police-body-camera-bill-into-law.php">signed into law SB 1304</a> [JURIST report], which includes the Law Enforcement Body Worn Camera Act, establishing sweeping regulations for police officers' use of body cameras while on duty. In July of last year New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's office <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/new-jersey-announces-plan-for-police-body-cameras.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the New Jersey State Police will spend $1.5 million to acquire 1,000 body cameras for troopers, in addition to the implementation of new guidelines aimed at expanding disclosures about investigations of officers' use of force. Also last year, the self-defense products company TASER International Inc. <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arizona-sheriff-deputies-to-receive-body-cameras.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Maricopa County Sheriff's Office will be receiving an order of cameras which will be worn by officers to record their actions in the field. Under the sales agreement, TASER would deliver 700 body cameras, costing an estimated $1 million. In 2014 the UN Committee Against Torture <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-committee-urges-us-to-investigate-police-brutality-and-limit-use-of-tasers---dnp.php">urged the US</a> [JURIST report] to open investigations into all cases of police brutality and excessive use of force by police officers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israeli lawmakers on Monday <a href="https://www.knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=12164">passed a controversial law</a> [press release] increasing regulation on Israeli human rights organizations. The law requires that organizations receiving more than 50 percent of their funding from foreign governments or political organizations disclose that they rely on such funding in "all communication with public officials and on television, newspapers, billboards and online." Some, such as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2393677.stm">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [BBC profile], have lauded the law as a measure to increase transparency between organizations and the public, but others believe it is just an attempt to target liberal organizations that disagree with the government. Many critics have denounced the bill claiming that it unfairly targets leftists that support Palestinian rights. </p>

<p>The increase in violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created a contentious human rights situation. The UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">released</a> [JURIST report] closing remarks to its fifty-seventh session in May, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. An Israeli court in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to a 50-day war in Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories Makarim Wibisono <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php"> resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory after repeated requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hundreds of Egyptians have been abducted and tortured by Egypt's National Security Agency during a crackdown on political activists and protesters, <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/hundreds-disappeared-and-tortured-amid-wave-of-brutal-repression-in-egypt">reported</a> [press release] Wednesday. Authorities have denied the accusations, but individuals have been prosecuted for isolated incidents. AI estimates three to four individuals are abducted each day. The report states there have been 17 incidents of torture where individuals have been held for as long as seven months with no access to the outside world. Tactics include beating and raping these individuals, who reportedly are as young as 14 years of age, in an attempt to obtain confessions. AI called for all states to pressure Egypt to end these human rights violations and cease all transfers of arms and equipment being used to conduct these acts. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC timeline] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over its many human rights infringements and free speech violations. Of particular concern is the prosecution and imprisonment of journalists by the Egyptian government, which has garnered widespread criticism from governments and rights groups worldwide. In March Egypt Justice Minister Ahmed al-Zind was relieved of his position after he stated that he would even imprison the Prophet Mohammed in response a question regarding the imprisonment of journalists. In January non-governmental organizations issued a <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ngos-issue-statement-to-egyptian-parliament-on-enforcement-of-constitutional-and-human-rights.php">joint statement</a> [JURIST report] to the Egyptian parliament giving recommendations to ensure the enforcement of constitutional and human rights. In December Egyptian lawyer Nasser Amin <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/egypt-lawyer-challenges-censorship-law.php">challenged a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows writers to be jailed for writings that violate Egyptian "morals." In August 2015 Egyptian President Abdel <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">Fattah el-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/egypt-passes-sweeping-anti-terrorism-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 54-article counter-terrorism law that has been met with significant controversy, as many believe it infringes on the freedom of the press. Many have said that the law defines terrorism too broadly and imposes harsh sentences and fines on violators. The same month <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/hrw-new-egypt-counterterrorism-law-threatens-press.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the law saying it infringes on freedom of the press.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/79f10115-e24e-49b3-b72b-1df1e7e97911/4/doc/14-2985_complete_opn.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> [corporate website] is not required to hand over customers' e-mails held overseas to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website]. The case was initiated when Microsoft sued the DOJ over their request for customer data held in Ireland. <a href="https://mscorpmedia.azureedge.net/mscorpmedia/2016/04/ECPA-Complaint.pdf">Microsoft claimed</a> [complaint, PDF] that a particular section of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2705">Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> [materials] was unconstitutional as it goes against their First Amendment and their customers' Fourth Amendment rights. Microsoft alleged that the federal government was violating these rights by preventing Microsoft from notifying its customers about government requests for their emails.  </p>

<p>The intersection between technology and privacy continues to raise important questions. In April the <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-no-warrant-required-to-obtain-phone-location-records.php">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled</a> [JURIST report] that obtaining phone location records without a warrant was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Last November the <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-declines-case-on-cell-data-search-warrant.php">US Supreme Court rejected a case</a> [JURIST report] to determine whether it is necessary to obtain a search warrant when law enforcement requests access to cell phone location data. In October <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/california-governor-signs-sweeping-digital-privacy-bill-into-law.php">California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law</a> [JURIST report] the California Electronic Communications Act, a law that many are touting as a substantial step forward for digital privacy and protecting users' rights. The law, which was approved alongside more than 10 other bills, bars any state's law enforcement agency or other investigative entity from requesting sensitive metadata from persons or businesses without a warrant. Also in October the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/eu-court-rules-transfer-of-user-data-violates-privacy-laws.php">European Court of Justice ruled</a> [JURIST report] that EU user data transferred to the US by various technology companies is not sufficiently protected.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://">European Union's</a> [official website] highest court released an <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-07/cp160074en.pdf">advisory opinion</a> [text] Wednesday stating that Asma Bougnaoui, a French Muslim woman who lost her job in 2009 for wearing a head scarf, was unlawfully discriminated against. The opinion found that Bougnaoui's release was not related to her ability to perform at work, rather it was directly related to her religious belief. However, the opinion noted, had Bougnaoui been wearing something that covered her face completely, the opinion may have been different. The court is expected to issue a formal judgment in the coming months. While the advisory opinion is not binding on the court, it is likely to be adopted.</p>

<p>Face veils and other symbols of religion have been a controversial subject around the world. Last year the US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of a Muslim woman who was <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-for-woman-denied-job-over-headscarf.php">denied a job</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> [corporate website] because of her headscarf. In September a Canadian court ruled that women may be <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/canada-court-rules-women-may-wear-veil-during-citizenship-oath.php">allowed to wear</a> [JURIST report] face-covering veils while swearing the oath of citizenship after an individual sued the country because she was not allowed to take part in the ceremony. Also in 2015, after suicide bombings in Fotokol by two women wearing burkas, Northern Cameroon <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/women-banned-from-wearing-burkas-in-northern-cameroon-after-suicide-bombings.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] women from wearing burkas and face-covering veils as the bombs had been smuggled into public under veils. In July 2014 the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-france-face-covering-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that France's face covering ban is permissible under European law and complies with all articles of the Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and does not violate freedom of religion. In February 2013 the Spanish Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/spain-supreme-court-strikes-down-city-burqa-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a city ban on wearing veils over the face in municipal buildings, finding that the law infringes on religious freedom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.icty.org/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [official website] war crimes defendant <a href="http://www.icty.org/case/hadzic/4">Goran Hadzic</a> [ICTY backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Goran+Hadzic">news archive</a>], the former president of the Republic of Serbian Krajina during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">Croatian War of Independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder], died Tuesday from brain cancer. Hadzic was accused of coordinating, supporting and instigating efforts to achieve the "permanent removal of a majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from a large part of the territory of the Republic of Croatia" during his term as president. Due to his health, Hadzic had been unfit to stand trial since October 2014 and was <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hadzic-granted-provisional-release-pending-trial.php">granted provisional release</a> [JURIST report] in April of last year.</p>

<p>The <a href="/paperchase/2012/10/icty-opens-final-war-crimes-trial.php">ICTY commenced Hadzic's trial</a> [JURIST report] in October 2012. In August 2011 Hadzic <a href="/paperchase/2011/08/hadzic-pleads-not-guilty-at-icty.php">entered a not guilty plea</a> [JURIST report] at the ICTY. Hadzic had <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hadzic-refuses-to-plead-at-icty.php">refused to enter a plea</a> the previous month when he was <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/hadzic-extradited-to-hague-to-face-icty.php">extradited to The Hague</a> [JURIST reports]. Hadzic was the last fugitive of the original 161 sought by the ICTY to be <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/serbia-captures-final-icty-fugitive-goran-hadzic.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report]. The ICTY's work in prosecuting suspected war criminals for acts committed during the Balkan War was part of the impetus for the creation of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] and other conflict and region specific criminal tribunals. The ICTY was the <a href="http://www.icty.org/sections/AbouttheICTY">first war crimes court created by the UN</a> [ICTY backgrounder] and the first international war crimes tribunal since the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals. It was created by the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] pursuant to Chapter VII of the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/">UN Charter</a> [text].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local groups and the <a href="https://www.laaclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana</a> [advocacy website] filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/160713_filed_complaint_-_doc._1.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] Wednesday against the Baton Rouge Police Department for violating the First Amendment rights of protestors who were peacefully protesting the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/local-groups-and-aclu-louisiana-sue-baton-rouge-police-first-amendment-violations-alton">police killing of Alton Sterling</a> [press release]. The suit claims that the police used excessive force, physical and verbal abuse, and wrongful arrests to intimidate and scatter those who were gathered. The complaint alleges that those attending the protest felt compelled to leave to "avoid indiscriminate arrest and aggressive police practices by a highly militarized police force in violation of their First Amendment rights."</p>

<p>The suit comes after the US Attorney's Office for the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdla">Middle District of Louisiana</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/doj-to-investigate-baton-rouge-police-killing-of-black-man.php">announced an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into Sterling's killing, which was recorded on video. The situation has occurred amid a national conversation about police use of force, particularly against black citizens, and subsequent retaliation. In a press conference held last week in Washington, DC, Attorney General Loretta Lynch gave her response to the shooting of police in Dallas during a peaceful protest. <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/loretta-lynch-condemns-shooting-of-dallas-police.php">Lynch stated that the Department of Justice</a> [JURIST report], including the FBI, ATF, and US Marshals Service and US Attorneys Office were conducting an investigation into the Dallas shooting. In May Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law an <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">amended hate crimes bill</a> [JURIST report], referred to as the "Blue Lives Matter" law, including police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected. The bill has drawn the contempt of some civil rights groups, including the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Earlier this year the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/san-francisco-police-under-doj-review.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the San Francisco Police Department following the shooting of an unarmed African American. In December an <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">Ohio grand jury decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Earlier that month the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/doj-to-open-investigation-into-chicago-police-department-after-shooting.php">DOJ announced that it would be opening a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Chicago Police Department following the 2014 police shooting death of a black teenager.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://gets.gc.k12.va.us/#">Gloucester County School Board</a> [official website] in Virginia <a href="http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/b1/6b15fc97-b52f-5a07-bb47-eaa4786cb76c/5786cd2323977.pdf.pdf">filed an emergency application</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday asking the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to block a ruling in favor of a Virginia transgender student. The application, filed to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx">Chief Justice Roberts</a> [official profile], asks the court to halt the application of both an <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/069_order_granting_plaintiff_g.g.s_motion_for_preliminary_injunction_2016.06.23.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] and a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/074_decision_2016.04.19_0.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit </a> [official website], which mandate that a transgender student be allowed to use the restroom that aligns with his gender identity. The school board is asking the court to put the injunction on hold until it decides if it will review the case. The school board is concerned that if the mandate were to take effect it would disrupt the upcoming school year. The district also alleges that the lower court gave <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-transgender-idUSKCN0ZT1XD">too much deference</a> [Reuters report] to the Obama administration's stance on gender identity and sex discrimination. </p>

<p>Gavin Grimm, a high school student at a Gloucester County school who identifies as male, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-orders-school-board-to-allow-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">granted an order</a> [JURIST report] by the district court in June allowing him to use the boys' restroom while the court considers the legal issues of the case. This order came after a decision by the federal court in April, which reversed a lower court decision in holding Grimm's rights under <a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm">Title IX</a> [official website], which prohibits discrimination in schools, were violated by the school board refusing his use of the men's restroom. It was at that time the Gloucester County School Board first stated its intention to ask the US Supreme Court to review the Fourth Circuit decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/OHCHRThematicReportUkraineJan2014-May2016_EN.pdf">report</a> [report, PDF] Thursday claiming that an estimated 9,300 people in Ukraine. including 2,000civilians, have been killed since the beginning of the separatist conflict in 2014. The report stated that there has been <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20267&LangID=E">very little accountability</a> [press release] for the deaths, and called for an end to impunity. Although the UN has found "90 per cent of conflict-related civilian deaths resulting from indiscriminate shelling of residential areas," it noted that citizens have also seemed to be targeted for their alleged political beliefs, particularly in the areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. The report also claimed that a number of the killings could amount to crimes against humanity. The report focuses on the civilian deaths, but notes extrajudicial killings of both servicemen and civilians, and also documents the "intentional homicide" of Ukrainian servicemen.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In June the OHCHR reported that the human rights situation in Ukraine <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ukraine-rights-violations-persist.php">remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia. In February Russia <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/russia-files-lawsuit-against-ukraine-over-3-billion-eurobond-debt.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Ukraine over Ukraine's default on $3 billion in bonds. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">plans to sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] on claims of financing terrorism. In August a Russian military court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Ukrainian activists to substantial jail time for the charge of conspiring to commit terror attacks. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its policy of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">refusing to recognize Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report]. In February 2015 Russian liberal political activist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31669061">Boris Nemtsov was shot in the back four times</a> [BBC report] in the middle of busy downtown Moscow. Nemtsov was openly politically opposed to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AFR1742602016ENGLISH.PDF">report</a> [report, PDF] released Thursday, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacywebsite] documented numerous human rights violations committed by Cameroon authorities in the country's crackdown on <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=boko%20haram&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive]. In a military campaign that AI West and Central Africa Regional Director calls the right end accomplished through "<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/cameroun-conditions-de-detention-effroyables-voire-tortures-a-mort-pour-plus-de-1-000-personnes-accusees-de-soutenir-boko-haram/">the wrong means</a>," [press release] Cameroon citizens have reportedly been subjected to arbitrary arrest, torture, enforced disappearances and incommunicado detention, and the death penalty is a near certainty for those convicted of supporting Boko Haram&#8212;100 people, including women, have been sentenced to death since July 2015. Once detained these citizens are placed in "desperately overcrowded prisons, in insanitary conditions where malnutrition is rampant." In one prison it has been noted that, on average, between six and eight prisoners will die as a result of these conditions each month. The heightened military offensive has also led to an increase of unnecessary force used against citizens and those detained, including extrajudicial killings and, in at least one case, the burning of houses. Those opposed to the country's anti-terror tactics claim the human rights violations are a result of "draconian" and ambiguous anti-terrorism laws introduced in 2014. AI, in the report, called upon Cameroon to setup a number of measures to address the numerous issues outlined and investigate all human rights violations alleged by citizens.</p>

<p>Cameroon's harsh practices have come in response to atrocities committed by Boko Haram which, according to a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ai-boko-haram-has-killed-hundreds-of-civilians-in-northern-cameroon.php">report</a> [JURIST report] earlier in September by AI, is accountable for the death of at least 400 civilians in Northern Cameroon. The militant Islamic group Boko Haram, whose name means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. In February UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-urge-nigeria-to-ensure-safety-of-liberated-areas.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Nigerian government to guarantee the safety of areas liberated from Boko Haram. In November the UN Secretary-General <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-sg-condemns-terrorist-attacks-in-nigeria.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] yet another attack by Boko Haram in Nigeria that left 30 dead and approximately 80 injured. In April 2015 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al-Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been murdering women and girls previously taken captive by the group. The group has been increasing the intensity and frequency of its <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ai-boko-haram-has-killed-hundreds-of-civilians-in-northern-cameroon.php">attacks</a> [JURIST report] ever since it lost most of the territory it overtook earlier last year to the Nigerian army. Most of these attacks have centered around markets, bus stations, places of worship and hit-and-run attacks on villages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>China to prosecute eminent human rights lawyer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] China is set to prosecute prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents. Zhou, who has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-idUSKCN0ZV133?il=0">secretly detained</a> [Reuters report] for months, is the director of the Beijing Fengrui law firm, which has represented several high-profile clients, including political dissident Ilham Tohti. Zhou and other members of his firm have been accused by the media of protesting outside of courts and bringing unneeded international attention through politicizing "ordinary cases." Though little is known about the case at this time, it is believed that Zhou's legal representation has been replaced by a government-appointed legal team. Hu Shigen, Cui Yanmin, and Gou Hongguo, three human rights activists, were also being prosecuted on the same charges. These impending prosecutions mark the most recent of the Xi Jinping administration's attempts to silence those critical of the country's human rights situation.</p>

<p>Xi's administration has been noted for increasing censorship of political opposition and rights groups. Last week Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-china-must-end-oppression-of-human-rights-activistslawyers.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for China to end its current attack on human and civil rights activists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Arizona affiliates of the <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-arizona">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy websites] filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/complaint_for_declaratory_and_injunctive_relief_3.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Thursday challenging an Arizona law they <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/issues/press-releases/2016-07/5664">claim</a> [press release] will "prevent low-income women from obtaining healthcare from their provider of choice." The groups are challenging <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/52leg/2r/bills/hb2599h.pdf">HB 2599</a> [materials], which would require medical providers to "segregate taxpayer dollars from abortions, including the use of taxpayer dollars for any overhead expenses attributable to abortions" in order to remain a part of Arizona's medicaid program. The complainants believe that this requirement is "unclear" and will lead to "arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement" by the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/">Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System</a> [official website], the agency responsible for administering the Medicaid program. Moreover, the complaint alleges that this law would impede Medicaid enrollees' right to "receive covered services from the qualified provider of their choice by federal law" in violation of federal Medicaid statutes, as well as Due Process and Equal Protection. Arizona previously attempted to pass similar legislation which prevented anyone who performed abortions under any circumstances, including in cases of rape, from being a part of the state Medicaid system. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website], in agreeing with a lower district court decision, upheld an injunction against the law in Planned Parenthood <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/az_defunding_9th_cir_8_22_13.pdf">Arizona, Inc. v. Betlach</a> [opinion, PDF]. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood are seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>

<p>This law is the most recent in a slew of state laws attempting to cut back on women's access to abortion. Earlier this month in a US district judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-blocks-florida-efforts-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against a law intended to cut state funding to clinics administering abortions. That same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-federal-court-blocks-state-abortion-bill.php">placed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on an Indiana law that would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. Recently the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a Texas <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Following Thursday's attack in Nice, French President François Hollande has chosen to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/15/terror-attack-french-president-franois-hollande-extends-state-of/">extend</a> [<em>Telegraph</em> news release] for three months the state of emergency, which had been set to expire on July 26. Stating that "[i]t is the whole of France which is under threat from Islamic terrorism," Hollande stepped back from his previous statements that it would be impossible to prolong indefinitely the state of emergency, which had been declared following the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Following his announcement, Hollande stated that the government would reassess the domestic terror threat, calling a meeting of the country's defense committee today. He also promised to increase military involvement in Syria and Iraq. The perpetrator has been killed, though it remains to be seen whether he acted alone as France remains on high alert. </p>

<p>At least 84 citizens were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">killed</a> [BBC report] during Bastille Day celebrations in Nice Thursday as a man driving a truck slammed through a crowd. The man, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, was killed by police. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, though the attack follows a call by Islamic State (IS) spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani for IS followers to kill non-believers in the West through any means possible. The Bastille Day tragedy is the second most deadly in a string of terrorist acts in France, including the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30717580">November 13 Paris attacks</a> [BBC news archive], which claimed 130 lives, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36524094">murder</a> [BBC report] of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to IS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.csj.gob.sv/idioma.html">Supreme Court of El Salvador</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Wednesday struck down the <a href="https://elliott.gwu.edu/sites/elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/acad/lahs/el-salvador-amnesty-2013.pdf">amnesty law of 1993</a> [backgrounder, PDF], opening the way for prosecution of those associated with various war crimes and crimes against humanity during the country's civil war. In a 4-1 decision the court <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/el-salvador-strikes-down-amnesty-for-crimes-during-its-civil-war/2016/07/14/5eeef2ec-49bf-11e6-8dac-0c6e4accc5b1_story.html">held</a> [WP article] the law unconstitutional and stated the government was under obligation to "investigate, identify and sanction the material and intellectual authors of human rights crimes and grave war crimes," as well as grant reparations to those affected. The decision was <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20275&LangID=E">hailed as a victory</a> [UN press release] by many human rights advocates, including a group of independent experts of the UN who claimed that the "decision by the highest court will restore the fundamental rights to justice and integral reparation of the victims." Some are less optimistic, however, as they believe the ruling will lead to a "political witch hunt" and intensify current political polarization. Mauricio Ernesto Vargas, a retired general who had been involved in the peace negotiations, stated "[t]he country doesn't have the economic and social conditions to add one more destabilizing ingredient to the mix." It is believed that the conflict led to the death of 75,000 and the disappearance of 8,000 more, as well as many more victims of torture, sexual violence, and displacement.</p>

<p>This decision will allow El Salvador to follow suit with the US, which has made significant strides over the past decade in prosecuting those involved in the El Salvadoran civil war. In 2011 the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-seeks-deportation-of-salvadoran-general-for-human-rights-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] General Eugenio Vides Casanova, former defense minister of El Salvador, for human rights crimes committed during the civil war while he served as the country's top military officer. The US was also <a href="http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/50168/2011/04/18/General-Vides-Casanova-podria-ser-deportado-de-EE-UU-acusado-de-tortura">seeking to deport</a> [<em>La Página</em> report, in Spanish] Vides, who retired in Florida after completing his six-year term as defense minister. Vides was successfully <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-deports-el-salvador-ex-general-tied-to-1980s-civil-war-rights-abuses.php">deported</a> [JURIST] in 2015. In 2006, <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circui</a>t [official website] upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">$55 million verdict</a> [JURIST report] against Vides and his co-defendant Jose Guillermo Garcia for allowing torture and other human rights violations during the war. In 2005, a US federal court reached a verdict against Nicolas Carranza, top commander of El Salvador's security forces during the civil war, for <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/us-jury-finds-ex-salvadoran-colonel.php">$2 million in compensatory damages</a> [JURIST report]. The case was brought by five Salvadoran citizens who alleged torture or had family killed by Carranza's soldier during the war. In 2000, however, the US lost the battle to seek justice for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/2-salvador-generals-cleared-by-us-jury-in-nuns-deaths.html?ref=joseguillermogarcia">murders of four American churchwomen</a> [NYT report] during the civil war when both Vides and Garcia were acquitted. The ruling was grounded in the doctrine that the generals, although responsible for their soldiers, may not have had complete effective power to reign in the abuses of their troops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] According to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, 200,000 civilians stuck in three Syrian towns are in <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20271&LangID=E">grave danger</a> [press release] as attacking forces draw near. Opposition-controlled areas of Aleppo, following recent airstrikes over the past few months, have lost around 10,000 to 30,000 civilians, who have fled, leaving at least 150,000 civilians "effectively totally trapped." Opposition shelling of government-held areas of Aleppo have further endangered these civilians, with 44 being killed between July 8 and 9. These citizens face not only death and injury from further airstrikes and military offensives, but also "minimal supplies of food, water, and medicine" running out. Zeid also expressed concern about thousands now in a similar situation in Darayya, in Western Ghouta. The some 8,000 civilians have been condensed to one square kilometre of "devastated urban ruin" with "no electricity, virtually no water and even less access to food than before." These civilians also face the threat of airstrikes and Zeid stated his discontent with what may happen to them if the city falls to the attacking forces. Finally, Zeid stated that he was perhaps most concerned with the situation Manbij in the eastern rural area of Aleppo Governorate, where the conflict between ISIL and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has intensified. Caught directly between the two fighting parties, civilians have been killed through airstrikes, ground offensives, and landmines. As SDF continues to move in on ISIL forces, civilians have been refused the ability to flee, leaving them without access to water, electricity, and cemeteries to bury their dead and killed relatives. Those killed in Manbij are believed to be in the dozens and the number of war crimes and human rights violations "surpasses the worst nightmares." Zeid called upon those in conflict to limit any further civilian casualties and further war crimes. He also urged those parties to "ensure that the fundamental needs of the besieged population such as food and water are met," stating that if they choose to ignore such needs "there will be a reckoning for all these crimes."</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">Syrian Civil War</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has been ongoing since 2011 when opposition groups first began protesting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and the increasingly bloody nature of the conflict has put pressure on the international community to intervene. In March AI reported that Russian and Syrian armed forces were deliberately attacking hospitals and other medical facilities as part of a military strategy to clear the way to northern Aleppo. Just prior, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/legislation-addressing-war-crimes-genocide-in-the-middle-east-passes-foreign-affairs-committee/">passed</a> [press release] two resolutions calling for an international tribunal in the Middle East to address the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-house-committee-calls-for-syria-war-crimes-tribunal.php">alleged war crimes</a> [JURIST report] committed by the government of Syria and its allies, specifically Russia and Iran. In February the UN reported that the Syrian government is systematically exterminating <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-office-syria-systematically-exterminating-detainees.php">detainees</a> [JURIST report]. In November Human Rights Watch released a report stating that the practice of caging captured soldiers and civilians constitutes <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-syria-armed-groups-are-committing-war-crimes.php">hostage-taking</a> [JURIST report] and an outrage against their personal dignity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thousands of children in Afghanistan are currently working in conditions hazardous to their health, according to a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/13/they-bear-all-pain/hazardous-child-labor-afghanistan">report</a> [report] released Thursday by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website]. According to the report, many of these children work in jobs that could lead to illness, injury, or even death as a result of failure to enforce safety and health standards. Among the dangerous jobs are home-based carpentry, brick kiln labor, tinsmithing and welding, mining, and working as street vendors and shoe shiners. While acknowledging that work with proper health and safety conditions can be beneficial to children, the report notes international law is violated where work jeopardizes the health and safety of children. Current Afghan law sets the minimum age for employment at 18, but allows for children between 15-17 to work so long as the work is not harmful, requires less than 35 hours of work, and represents a form of vocational training. Afghanistan has also recently ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C182">Convention No. 182</a> [materials] on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, and <a href="http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312283">Convention No. 138</a> [materials] on the Minimum Age of employment, though the government has not upheld these domestic and international standards, citing "budgetary constraints and lack of capacity" as the driving forces behind the country's inability to protect child laborers. The report consists of a variety of interviews including interviews with 15 male and female child laborers, 10 parents and employers in Bamiyan and Kabul, American and Afghan government officials, UN officials, teachers, etc. The report outlines a variety of measures for the Afghan government to take in order to better protect child laborers, including increasing the number of labor inspectors, allowing different governmental agencies to monitor and respond to child labor issues, improving child labor agencies, and making education more available by providing more flexible educational services.</p>

<p>In recent years child labor laws have become a growing subject of international attention. In the US, federal regulations like the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> (FLSA) [PDF] are the major controlling factor of child labor. In April 2015 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2015/04/13/ripe-abuse/palestinian-child-labor-israeli-agricultural-settlements-west-bank">reported</a> [text] that Israeli settlement farmers in the occupied West Bank are using Palestinian child laborers in dangerous conditions in <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-israel-settlement-farmers-violating-international-child-labor-laws.php">violation of international laws</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2014 the Bolivian National Congress passed legislation <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/bolivia-lowers-child-labor-age-restriction.php">permitting</a> [JURIST report] children as young as 10 to join the workforce as long as it does not interfere with one's education and is done independently in an effort to provide for their family. In 2013 the ILO released a report on child labor <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/un-group-social-protections-key-to-ending-child-labor.php">advocating social protections</a> [JURIST report] as the key to ending the practice. "[The] report contributes to a better understanding of the underlying economic and social vulnerabilities that generate child labour."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UN rights panel advises Kuwait to amend compulsory DNA testing law</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An 18-person UN human rights panel called on Kuwait Friday to <a href="http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CCPR/Shared%20Documents/KWT/CCPR_C_KWT_CO_3_24583_E.docx">amend</a> [report, DOC] its compulsory DNA testing law. The law, a counter-terrorism measure put in place by Kuwait's parliament in 2015, facilitated a DNA database of citizens and residents of Kuwait, and imposes a one-year sentence to anyone who refuses to provide their DNA. The panel stated the law "imposes unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions on the right to privacy." Jamal Alghunaim, Kuwait's ambassador to the UN argued that the law was substantially related to protecting against terrorist threats and had sufficient safeguards against persons or groups acquiring the information. The panel was not convinced with this sort of logic, though, saying that "[w]e...asked them to amend it to ensure that DNA collection is limited, only on the basis of individuals suspected of having committed serious crimes and on the basis of a court order."</p>

<p>The collection and retention of DNA samples by the government and police has sparked a complex argument on procedures and ethics of such practice relative to privacy. In the US it has been a particularly difficult question to answer. In 2014 a US district court <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/california-dna-collection-law-struck-down.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a California law which required anyone suspected of committing a felony to provide a DNA sample as soon as "administratively possible." The court held that doing so before a judicial determination of probable cause was not reasonable. In 2013 the United States Supreme Court had <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3234257148722545343&q=maryland+v.+king&hl=en&as_sdt=6,39">ruled</a> [opinion] that collecting DNA from an individual arrested for a felony was "a legitimate police booking procedure." Some also believe that DNA collection altogether <a href="/dateline/2015/02/christen-giannaros-dna-collection.php">violates</a> [JURIST commentary] the Fourth Amendment guarantee of privacy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The House Intelligence Committee on Friday released declassified "<a href="http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/declasspart4.pdf">28-pages</a>" [report, PDF], detailing connections between Saudi Arabia and 9/11 hijackers. Whether "28-pages" should be released was a hotly debated matter, spanning years as victims' families and lawmakers had pressed for the report to be released. Some calling for the release of the report believed that the US had been attempting to cover up Saudi Arabia's involvement in the attacks.  While the document acknowledges that "some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government," other sources, including the 9/11 Commission report, have held that the Saudi government was in no way involved in the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers. Despite containing only leads to possible Saudi ties to the 9/11 hijackers, which were investigated by government officials, former Senator Bob Graham was happy with the release in that it would lead to further questioning of the Saudi government's potential involvement. He also added that "I think of this almost as the 28 pages are sort of the cork in the wine bottle. And once it's out, hopefully the rest of the wine itself will start to pour out." </p>

<p>In May the Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/us-senate-approves-bill-allowing-saudi-arabia-to-be-sued-for-911-attacks.php">approved a bill</a> [JURIST report] allowing 9/11 victims' families to sue Saudi Arabia. The bill must now pass the House and be signed by President Barack Obama, who has threatened to veto the bill. In 2012 a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-dismisses-motion-to-reinstate-saudi-arabia-as-911-defendant.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Saudi Arabia as a defendant in a civil compensation lawsuit by victims against the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim against Saudi Arabia was dismissed in 2008 by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit due to insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes has actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the attacks. In 2005 Judge Richard Casey <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/rulings/03MDL1570_RCC_011905.PDF">dismissed</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">report</a>] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that all had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Serbian paramilitary commander Dragan Vasiljkovic, also known Daniel Sneddon, has pleaded not guilty to the charges of "war crimes" brought against him. The 61-year old Vasiljkovic will <a href="http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/former-serbian-paramilitary-commander-dragan-vasiljkovic-pleads-not-guilty-to-war-crimes/news-story/de4bb6224e3ed618fa2b4303f89c8fe4">face a court</a> [News Corp Australia report] in the port of Split in Croatia later this year. The charges levied against him include the torture and mass murder of Croats, including prisoners of war, and civilians during the Balkan War in 1991. Vasiljkovic, who was sent to Croatia in 2015, is the first person to be extradited from Australia for war crimes.</p>

<p>Vasiljkovic was first arrested in Australia in 2006, following an extradition request from the Croatian government. He fought his extradition in the Australian courts ever since, claiming that he would not be able to receive a fair trial in Croatia. Vasiljkovic has challenged extradition at least 13 times. In 2012 the Australian Minister for Justice formally <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/australia-approves-extradition-of-alleged-serbian-war-criminal.php">approved Vasiljkovic's extradition to Croatia</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/07/15/14-16375.pdf">concluded</a> [opinion, PDF] that sound levels approved by the Obama administration violate the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). The MMPA <a href="http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/what-we-do/rescue/marine-mammal-protection-act.html">prohibits</a> [official website] people from harassing, feeding, hunting, capturing, collecting or killing any marine mammal or a part of a marine mammal. The <a href="http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> (NMFS) [official website] is a US federal agency that is in charge of managing the country's living marine resources. The NMFS approved emissions in 2012 that the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org">National Resource Defense Council</a> (NRDC) [advocacy website] and other environmental groups <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/351488-navy-whales-lower-sonar/">alleged</a> [RT report] violated the MMPA and filed suit. The appellate court ruled 3-0 that the approved emissions violated the MMPA, reversing and remanding to the district court for further proceedings.</p>

<p>The use of Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) technology has been contested between its users and environmental groups for its ability to negatively impact marine life. In 2008 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2008/11/supreme-court-rules-against.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the US Navy may continue using sonar as part of military training exercises, ruling against environmentalists' concerns for the impact it would have on whales and other marine life. In the same year, Director of Urban Programs, Natural Resources Defense Council Joel Reynolds, <a href="/hotline/2008/10/sonar-case-highlights-district-courts.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that a sonar case highlighted federal courts' equitable power to weigh competing interests. Also in 2008, counsel for the Pacific Legal Foundation Steven Gieseler and Reed Hopper <a href="/hotline/2008/10/navy-sonar-case-should-balance.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that a Navy sonar case should balance protecting environment with other legitimate interests. By contrast, Staff Attorney at the NRDC Cara Horowitz <a href="/hotline/2008/10/navy-sonar-case-should-balance.php">argued</a> [JURIST op-ed] that the Bush Administration was overreaching executive power by exempting the Navy from complying with the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The coup <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/16/military-coup-turkey-what-we-know-now/87171074/">began</a> [USA Today report] when military forces seized key areas of the country and control of state-run television stations. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/world/europe/turkey-attempted-coup-erdogan.html?_r=0">accused</a> [NYT report] the followers of exiled Muslim cleric in Pennsylvania, Fethullah Gulen, as the coup's plotters. Gulen has denied any involvement. The government has largely regained control with some parts of the country experiencing continued unrest. Saturday saw a nation-wide <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/07/turkey-government/491579/">purge</a> [<em>Atlantic</em> report] of dissidents suspected of involvement in the coup with greater authority as the Turkish parliament recently <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-judiciary-idUSKCN0ZH4IZ">passed</a> [Reuters report] a judicial reform bill that allows the president to replace "troublesome" judges with allies. The plotters had issued the following televised <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/turkey-coup-attempt-reaction-world-160715215141043.html">statement</a> [Al Jazeera report] that may shed light on their possible motives:<blockquote>Turkish armed forces have completely taken over the administration of the country to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, the rule of law and the general security that was damaged.

<p>Erdogan has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-36811357">vowed</a> [BBC backgrounder] that those involved in the coup will "pay a heavy price" and the aftermath of the coup may be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/aftermath-of-turkish-coup-attempt-will-be-bloody-and-repressive">bloody and repressive</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] as the state of human rights has been controversial in Turkey for years. This week, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-turkey-preventing-independent-investigation-into-mass-abuses-against-civilians.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report stating that Turkey has blocked access for independent investigations into mass abuses against civilians. Earlier this month a US federal court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-court-dismisses-lawsuit-against-rival-of-turkish-president.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against Gulen alleging he issued orders from Pennsylvania directing his followers in Turkey to launch a campaign of persecution against other religious groups in that country. US Secretary of State John Kerry has <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/turkey-coup-fethullah-gulen-erdogan-extradition-us-barack-obama-john-kerry-return-cleric-blamed-a7140786.html">stated</a> [<em>Independent</em> report] that the US would "consider" an extradition request for the cleric if it is proven that he was involved in the attempted coup. In May the Turkish parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/turkish-lawmakers-grant-immunity-to-armed-forces-conducting-anti-terrorism-measures.php">granted</a> immunity to armed forces conducting counter-terrorism measures and <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/turkish-parliament-votes-to-strip-lawmakers-immunity.php">advanced</a> [JURIST reports] an amendment to strip immunity privileges from members of parliament. In 2015, then-Human Rights Commissioner for Germany <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/germany-commissioner-says-turkey-does-not-belong-in-eu.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey must improve its human rights record before it can be admitted to the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.narodnaskupstinars.net/?q=en">National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska</a> [official website] voted on Friday to <a href="http://www.narodnaskupstinars.net/?q=la/vijesti/19-posebna-sjednica-narodne-skup%C5%A1tine-usvojena-odluka-o-raspisivanju-referenduma-o-danu-republike">hold a referendum</a> [press release, in Serbian] within its territory on September 25 to decide whether to set its <correction num=1>Statehood Day on January 9.</correction> The date coincides with an Orthodox Christian holiday and is therefore seen to exclude Roman Catholic Croatians and Bosnian Muslims who also live in the Republic. This move is being seen as a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bosnia-serbs-referendum-idUSKCN0ZV1YW">display of defiance</a> [Reuters report] against the <a href="http://www.ccbh.ba/?lang=en">Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitutional Court</a> [official website], which expressly ruled last year that the date should be changed. Some lawmakers challenged the vote on the grounds that the recognition of Statehood Day would violate the terms of the <a href="http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/icty/dayton/daytonaccord.html">Dayton Peace Accords</a> [text] which brought the three-year war in the Balkans to an end in 1995. Bosnian Serbs traditionally mark the anniversary of January 9, 1992, when they declared independence from Bosnia prior to the commencement of hostilities. The Republic is one of two largely autonomous regions that make up the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>

<p>Tensions between the ethnic Bosnian and Serbian populations of the former Yugoslavian states continue to be emotionally charged, years after the Balkan war.  The <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [JURIST backgrounder] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the conflict. In March, the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/icty-acquits-serbian-nationalist-seselj-of-all-balkan-war-crimes.php#">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Vojislav Šešelj, president of the Serbian Radical Party and former Assembly member of Serbia, of all crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the Balkan war. In May 2015 the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/icty-orders-serbia-to-return-seselj-to-detention.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Serbia's justice ministry to <a href="/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">return Šešelj to his detention cell immediately</a> [JURIST op-ed] after he was released in February to return to Serbia for cancer treatment. The ICTY had <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icty-orders-serbian-nationalist-seselj-to-return-to-court.php">revoked his provisional release</a> [JURIST report] in March 2015 because Šešelj spoke at a news conference in Belgrade and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-serb-nationalist-vojislav-seselj-back-to-detention-1427715609">stated</a> [WSJ report] that he would not return voluntarily to The Hague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a judicial source, four men believed to be linked to Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Tunisian who killed 84 people as he drove a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36813959">have been arrested</a> [BBC report]. One of the men was arrested on Thursday, while the three others were arrested overnight on Friday. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's estranged wife has also been detained by police. These new arrests have come as the development of a meeting between <a href="http://www.elysee.fr/">President François Hollande</a> [official website, in French] and his top security advisors in Paris. Cautioning against a temptation to create deep divisions in the country, Hollande termed the attack a terrorist act and extended the state of emergency <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/france-president-extends-state-of-emergency-by-three-months.php">by three months</a> [JURIST report]. France began three days of national mourning for Nice victims on Saturday.</p>

<p>At least <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">84 citizens were killed</a> [BBC report] during Bastille Day celebrations in Nice Thursday as Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a truck through a crowd. He was subsequently killed by Nice police. Thus far, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-16/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-nice-attack/7635270">Islamic State has claimed responsibility</a> [ABC News report] for the attack, which followed a call by Islamic State (IS) spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani for IS followers to kill non-believers in the West through any means possible. The Bastille Day attack is the second most deadly in a string of terrorist acts in France, including the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30717580">November 13 Charlie Hebdo attacks</a> [BBC news archive], which claimed 130 lives, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36524094">murder</a> [BBC report] of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to IS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Groups of activists in Vietnam were detained Sunday while protesting China's <a href="http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1381740.shtml">rejection</a> [official statement] of the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Award.pdf">international ruling</a> [text, PDF] regarding the South China Sea. The <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> (PCA) [official website] issued the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/international-tribunal-rules-for-philippines-in-south-china-sea-dispute.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday, finding that between the Philippines and China, the parties in the lawsuit, China has <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/175/2016/07/PH-CN-20160712-Press-Release-No-11-English.pdf">no legal claim</a> [PCA press release, PDF] for large portions of the South China Sea. Vietnam had previously <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/vietnam-urges-fair-and-objective-ruling-in-south-china-sea-territory-dispute.php">issued a statement</a> [JURIST report] urging a "fair and objective" ruling in the matter, favoring a decision for the Philippines. China, on the other hand, has <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-to-ignore-un-ruling-concerning-the-south-china-sea.php">long disputed</a> [JURIST report] the PCA's jurisdiction over the matter. While not a party in the lawsuit, activists <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-17/vietnam-detains-activists-after-south-china-sea-ruling/7636228">gathered in Vietnam's capital</a> [ABC report] due to their country's competing claims to the South China Sea, and China's rejection of the ruling only contributed to existing anti-Chinese sentiment in the country.</p>

<p>Territorial disputes over the South China Sea have been an <a href="/forum/2012/10/michael-kelly-china-unclos.php">ongoing source of tension</a> [JURIST op-ed] between China and its neighboring countries. China claims nearly the entire <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/philippines-high-court-approves-deal-to-extend-us-military-presence.php">3.5 million square-kilometer</a> [JURIST report] South China Sea, a region believed to be rich in oil and minerals. China has come into territorial conflict over the region in the past not only with the <a href="/sidebar/2011/07/edsel-tupaz-spratlys-dispute.php">Philippines</a> [JURIST op-ed], but also with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippines and China were involved in a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/07/201273093650328417.html">stand-off</a> [Al Jazeera report] around the Scarborough Shoal, a small cluster of uninhabitable islands 220 km off the coast of the Philippines which, according to international maritime law, fall into the Philippines' economic zone. The standoff was triggered when Chinese vessels blocked the Philippine navy from arresting Chinese fishermen for alleged illegal fishing activities within the Philippines' exclusive economic zones. The PCA in The Hague ruled in October that it has jurisdiction to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hague-court-to-rule-in-south-china-sea-dispute.php">hear the dispute</a> [JURIST report] between the Philippines and China over parts of the South China Sea. For its part, China has refused to recognize PCA's jurisdiction on the case, even going as far as calling it a "law-abusing tribunal." However, the case was interpreting the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm">UN Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> (UNCLOS) [materials], to which China is a signatory.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bahrain High Civil Court on Sunday ordered <a href="http://alwefaq.net/cmsen/">al-Wefaq</a> [party website], the main Shiite opposition group in the country, to be dissolved. The Bahraini court previously issued a three-month <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/bahrain-court-suspends-opposition-group.php">suspension of the group</a> [JURIST report]. The court found that the group has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/06/bahraini-court-suspends-al-wefaq-opposition-group-160614133354700.html">engaged</a> [Al Jazeera] in "terrorism, extremism, and violence." The ban was pending this verdict to determine whether it will be required to dissolve or allowed to continue. The dissolution order requires al-Wefaq's assets to be liquidated and transferred to the state treasury. Additionally, the order has sparked criticism from many sources, such as UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, as being repressive and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-statement-on-the-dissolution-of-al-wefaq-in-bahrain">preventing political freedom</a> [official statement].</p>

<p>The kingdom of Bahrain is considered an ally of the US but has faced growing international concerns about its human rights practices. A UN human rights adviser <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-adviser-urges-bahrain-to-respect-freedom-of-assembly.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on Bahrain in June to ensure human rights are respected following protests triggered by the decision to strip Sheikh Issa Qassem, a prominent Shia religious leader, of his nationality. In February Bahraini authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bahrain-authorities-detain-4-us-journalists.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] four US journalists covering the five-year anniversary of the nation's 2011 uprising and formally charged them. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported in February that nearly five years after Bahrain's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12471243">Day of Rage</a> [BBC report], protests <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-bahrain-rights-reform-outlook-bleak.php">sparked</a> [JURIST report] international concern over Bahraini government accountability in human rights, and the hope for reform has dwindled.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A South Korean senior prosecutor was arrested Sunday on bribery charges following investigations into his corrupt relationship with major online game company <a href="http://company.nexon.co.jp/en/">Nexon</a> [corporate website]. Prosecutor Jin Kyung-joon was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/world/asia/top-south-korean-prosecutor-arrested-on-charges-that-he-accepted-bribes.html">accused</a> [NYT report] of taking the equivalent of USD $370,000 from Nexon founder Kim Jung-ju in 2005 to buy the company's unlisted Korean stock. Jin has allegedly garnered $370,000 selling back the Korean shares as well as $11 million selling back Nexon's Japanese shares last year. Kim is being simultaneously investigated for using corrupt business methods and has promised to cooperate with officials. In addition, Jin is being investigated for intervening in a tax investigation against Korean Air in exchange for a contract agreement for his brother-in-law. Justice Minister Kim Hyun-woong, head of South Korea's prosecutors, has apologized to the people amidst growing concerns over the relationship between government and business leaders. </p>

<p>Jin's arrest follows recent news of corruption investigations taking place worldwide. Earlier this month a federal judge in Buenos Aires <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ex-argentina-presidents-assets-frozen.php">froze</a> [JURIST report] the assets of former Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner who was charged with conspiring to sell USD $17 billion in futures contracts using an inflated dollar value for the country's own currency. Also this month, a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-jails-former-presidents-top-aide-on-bribery-charges.php">sentenced </a> [JURIST report] a former president's top aide to life in prison after finding him guilty of taking bribes, illegally obtaining state secrets and abuse of power. Last month the Supreme Court of the Maldives <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/maldives-supreme-court-upholds-prison-sentence-of-former-president.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the 13-year prison sentence of former President Mohamed Nasheed on terrorism-related charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An advisory board to the <a href="http://www.au.int/">African Union</a> (AU) on Saturday accused the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official websites] of narrowly focusing its investigations on African government leaders since its inception in 2002. Last April, AU members <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/african-union-advisory-body-slams-international-criminal-court/3421310.html">ordered</a> [VOA report] the <a href="http://pages.au.int/ecosocc">Economic Social and Cultural Council</a> (ECOSOCC) [official website] to evaluate their ties to the ICC amidst growing concerns that ICC is inherently biased against them. The ECOSOCC now condemns the ICC, accusing the court of favoring the UN and EU nations that strongly support it. The board pointed to the fact that nine out of the ICC's 10 active investigations are based in Africa. The ECOSOCC has therefore recommended that AU members should quit the ICC should lawmakers follow through with a proposed amendment allowing the prosecution and arrest of African heads of state. Opponents of the recommendation have voiced concerns that quitting the ICC would increase the risk of human rights violations. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] also stated that giving African leaders immunity would defeat the purpose of the ICC's creation. While the ECOSOCC does not officially speak for AU members, African nations continued to discuss the ICC during the AU summit taking place over the weekend.</p>

<p>An ICC matter of current concern has been an ongoing case against ex-Congolese military leader <a href="https://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Bemba&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Jean-Pierre Bemba</a> [JURIST news archive]. Last month the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/icc-sentences-ex-congolese-military-leader-bemba-to-18-years.php">sentenced</a> Bemba to 18 years in jail after finding him <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/jurist-the-case-of-the.php">guilty</a> [JURIST reports] for crimes against humanity and war crimes stemming from his involvement in the conflict in the Central African Republic in 2002 and 2003. In September Bemba <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-congo-vp-pleads-not-guilty-to-interfering-with-administrati.php">pleaded not guilty</a> to charges of interfering with the administration of justice after he and four members of his legal team were <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/former-congolese-vice-president-ordered-to-stand-trial-on-charges-of-interfering-with-justice.php">ordered to stand trial</a> [JURIST reports] on those charges. In October 2014 ICC Trial Chamber III <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/icc-delays-closing-arguments-in-bemba-case-to-hear-prosecution-witness.php">delayed the closing statements</a> [JURIST report] in the case against Bemba so that it could hear additional witness testimony after the defense requested to testify about alleged collusion between prosecution witnesses. In November 2013 <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/icc-announces-arrests-for-falsifying-evidence-in-congo-rebel-leaders-war-crimes-trial.php">four persons were arrested on charges of falsifying evidence</a> [JURIST report] in connection with the trial of Jean-Pierre Bemba Bemba's defense lawyers opened their case before the ICC in August 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of international human rights experts, including UN Special Rapporteur on torture Juan E. Méndez, on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/SP/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20269&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] states worldwide to adopt the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/NelsonMandelaRules.pdf">Revised Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners</a> [text, PDF]. Also known as the Nelson Mandela Rules, the standards "represent a universally accepted minimum standard for the treatment of prisoners, conditions of detention and prison management, and offer essential practical guidance to prison administrations." The rules were adopted in 1957 and <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52190#.V4zkmPkrJD8">revised</a> [UN News Centre report] in 2015, when they were renamed in honor of the former President of South Africa, "who spent 27 years in prison in the course of his struggle for global human rights, equality, democracy and the promotion of a culture of peace." </p>

<p>The rights of incarcerated individuals are an important and contentious topic worldwide. In the United States, the issue is most acutely expressed in the Guantanamo Bay controversy. In February, President Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/obama-delivers-guantanamo-closure-plan-to-congress.php">delivered</a> [JURIST report] his closure plans to Congress, stating that "closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility is a national security imperative. Its continued operation weakens our national security by furthering the recruiting propaganda of violent extremists, hindering relations with key allies and partners, and draining Department of Defense resources." Hindering Obama's plans, in November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama has subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/us-transfers-guantanamo-detainees-to-serbia-italy.php">permitted</a> [JURIST report] international prisoner transfers, a move that furthers the goal of closing Guantanamo, but may subject prisoners to rights deprivations elsewhere. In June, a report indicated that China <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-continues-to-harvest-organs-of-prisoners-report.php">harvests</a> [JURIST report] thousands of organs from non-consenting prisoners yearly. In May, over 2000 prisoners were <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/zimbabwe-more-than-2000-prisoners-released-over-congestion-food-shortage.php">released</a> [JURIST report] from Zimbabwe's prison system due to overcrowding and food shortages. Earlier in May, Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-south-sudan-detainees-held-in-inhumane-conditions.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that dozens of detainees in South Sudan were being held in inhumane conditions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Baltimore City Police Lieutenant Brian Rice on Monday was <a href="http://www.baltimorecitycourt.org/highlighted-case/case-no-115141035-state-v-brian-rice/">found not guilty</a> [docket] of involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office in connection with Freddie Gray's arrest and death on April 12, 2015. Rice was the highest-ranking of six Baltimore police officers charged in the incident, and was the fourth to go on trial. Circuit Judge <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bal-who-is-the-judge-in-the-freddie-gray-hearing-20150901-story.html">Barry Williams</a> [Baltimore Sun profile], the judge who presided over Rice's bench trial, previously acquitted officers <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-nero-verdict-20160521-story.html">Edward Nero</a> and <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-goodson-verdict-20160623-story.html">Caesar Goodson, Jr.</a> of charges relating to Gray's death. Officer <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-porter-jury-split-20160115-story.html">William Porter</a> [Baltimore Sun reports] had a mistrial in January, after a 12-member jury was unable to come to an agreement regarding his guilt on involuntary manslaughter charges. Prosecutors alleged that Rice had caused Gray's death by failing to secure him in the transport van, despite knowing of the need to do so. The defense claimed that, given the volatility of the situation and Gray's combativeness, failing to secure him was reasonable. Officer Garrett Miller is the next officer to go on trial in the Freddie Gray case, scheduled for July 27.</p>

<p>The State's Attorney for Baltimore City in May, 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-indicted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the indictment of the police officers on charges including murder and manslaughter over the death Gray. Gray's arrest and death in April of last year led to widespread protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. In September Baltimore reached a tentative agreement with Gray's family to <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/baltimore-reaches-tentative-64-million-settlement-in-freddie-gray-case.php">pay $6.4 million in settlement</a> [JURIST report]. In April of last year Amnesty International urged Baltimore police to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Kenyan court on Monday <a href="http://nairobitimez.com/2016/07/18/prosecutor-presents-enough-evidence-to-jail-laywer-willie-kimani-killers/">approved charges</a> [<em>Nairobi Times</em> report] against four police officers for the murder of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani. The bodies of Kimani, his client Josphat Mwenda, and their taxi driver Joseph Muiruri <a href="http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/07/05/autopsy-report-reveals-lawyer-willie-kimani-was-beaten-then-strangled_c1380751">showed</a> [<em>The Star</em> report] signs of torture when they were discovered earlier this month.The <a href="http://www.ijm.org/">International Justice Mission</a> (IJM) [advocacy website], Kimani's employer, has <a href="http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/07/18/ijm-launches-global-petition-calling-for-removal-of-deputy-ig-arachi_c1388543">stated</a> [The Star report] that it believes there are more perpetrators involved in the deaths. The four officers from Kenya's <a href="http://www.administrationpolice.go.ke/">Administration Police</a> [official website] have <a href="http://www.nation.co.ke/news/Four-police-officers-charged-Willie-Kimani-murder/-/1056/3299460/-/6asuhq/-/index.html/">denied</a> [Daily Nation report] the charges. The accused are <a href="https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2016/07/4-aps-deny-killing-lawyer-kimani-client-cab-driver/">set</a> [Capital News report] to appear in court on August 16 to apply for bail, giving the prosecution a month to prepare statements from 45 witnesses. </p>

<p>The murders have outraged the international and domestic communities and have added to the list of police abuses in recent months. Earlier this week, US Democrats in Congress <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/democrats-call-for-hearing-on-recent-police-shootings.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for hearings in the wake of police shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two black men. This month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-extrajudicial-executions-by-police-threaten-security-in-rio-de-janeiro.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report saying extrajudicial killings by police threaten the over-all security in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the summer Olympics. A statement by 34 international human rights organizations <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/kenya-investigate-killings-of-lawyer-two-men/">condemned</a> [AI report] the murders and hundreds have taken to the streets of Nairobi to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/kenya-police-officers-will-be-charged-with-murder-of-3-men.php">protest</a> [JURIST report] extrajudicial killings in the capital. Western governments who provide financial support to Kenya have also expressed their concern over the murders and are urging the country to reform and comply with international human rights standards.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott <a href="http://gov.texas.gov/news/press-release/22514">announced</a> [press release] on Monday that he plans to propose a law providing for additional punishment for crimes against law enforcement officers. The proposed Police Protection Act (PPA) would extend hate crime protections to  law enforcement officers, organize a "campaign to educate young Texans on the value law enforcement officers bring to their communities" and "increase criminal penalties for any crime in which the victim is a law enforcement officer" even if the crime would not otherwise qualify as a hate crime. Abbott used assault with bodily injury as an example of a crime subject to the proposed enhancements, from the current third degree felony to a second degree felony under the proposal.</p>

<p>The Governor's announcement comes amid a national conversation about police use of force, particularly against black citizens, and subsequent retaliation. This week, Texas Senator John Cornyn <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/07/18/texas-gov-abbott-targeted-killing-of-police-should-be-a-hate-crime/?utm_term=.27114fe89427">introduced</a> [WP report] legislation that would elevate the penalties for killing, conspire to kill, or attempting to kill officers and judges. Last week, North Carolina's Governor Pat McCory <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/north-carolina-governor-signs-law-requiring-a-court-order-to-obtain-police-body-camera-footage.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] into law a bill providing that police camera footage, including body camera footage, is not a matter of public record and proscribes the procedure for release of footage. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed a "Blue Lives Matter" bill that also <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">raises the penalties</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against police officers. Some have criticized the measures as being redundant since many laws already raise the penalties for crimes against police officers. Kami N. Chavis from Wake Forest University School of Law <a href="/forum/2016/07/kami-chavis-hate-crime.php">discussed</a> [JURIST Commentary report] the recent proposals to add police officers to hate crime statutes last week. In June, Jessica Henry of Montclair State University <a href="/forum/2016/06/jessica-henry-hate-crimes.php">discussed</a> [JURIST Commentary report] the recent additions to Louisiana's hate crime legislation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] published a new <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/MDE1341962016ENGLISH.PDF">report</a> [text, PDF] on Monday claiming that Iranian authorities have been denying adequate medical coverage to political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.  AI claims that Iran is putting these prisoners at grave risk of death, permanent disability and other irreversible damage to their health because of their actions.  The group alleges that the Iranian authorities deny health care as an "intentional act of cruelty intended to intimidate, punish or humiliate political prisoners, or to extract forced confessions or statements of repentance from them."  The report <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/iran-is-putting-political-prisoners-lives-at-risk-by-denying-them-medical-care/">details 18 cases</a> [AI news release] of prisoners  who have been denied such care.  It was also uncovered that women prisoners are sometimes denied medical treatment because it is deemed inappropriate for a male doctor to treat them.  </p>

<p>The treatment of prisoners and prisoner rights are disputed and criticized throughout the world. In October 2015 the UN <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-issues-nelson-mandela-rules-on-treatment-of-prisoners.php">issued the Revised Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners</a> [JURIST report] to improve the treatment of prisoners throughout the world.  Earlier in October the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/european-court-of-justice-ruled-that-the-ban-of-voting-for-criminals-must-be-proportionate-to-the-of.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a convicted murderer could be banned from voting because the ban is proportionate to the offense. In August former Iranian prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/european-court-of-justice-ruled-that-the-ban-of-voting-for-criminals-must-be-proportionate-to-the-of.php">was acquitted of murder charges</a> [JURIST report] relating to the 2009 <a href="/paperchase/2010/03/iran-court-begins-trial-of-prison.php">killing of three prisoners</a> [JURIST report] which he oversaw. The prisoners were detained in 2009 for protesting against former President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad's disputed re-election - an issue that drew significant global criticism aimed not only at Iran's government, but also the treatment of those arrested following the election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turkish <a href="https://www.tccb.gov.tr/en/receptayyiperdogan/">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> [official website] stated Monday that he would <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/18/asia/turkey-attempted-coup/">approve reinstating the death penalty</a> [CNN report] so long as the measure had sufficient support in the <a href="https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/">Grand National Assembly</a> [official website, in Turkish].  The death penalty was abolished over a decade ago in Turkey, but Erdogan <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0718/803063-turkey-attempted-coup/">asserted</a> [RTE News report] that the Turkish people want the death penalty for those involved in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/18/middleeast/turkey-failed-coup-explainer/index.html">last weekend's failed military coup</a> [CNN backgrounder].  Erdogan also announced he will request the extradition of cleric <a href="https://www.fgulen.com/en/">Fethullah Gulen</a> [advocacy website], whom Erdogan alleges orchestrated the coup attempt, from the United States.  US <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/">Secretary of State John Kerry</a> [official website] stated that Turkey must provide <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/07/260174.htm">genuine evidence</a> [statement] that withstands scrutiny if it wishes to request Gulen's extradition.  European Union (EU) <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/mogherini_en">High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini</a> [official website] has also weighed in on the Erdogan's announcement, saying that "no country can become an EU member state if it introduces the death penalty."  <a href="https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BKin/EN/AngelaMerkel/angela_merkel_node.html">German Chancellor Angela Merkel</a> [official website] also expressed concern over Turkey's response to the coup attempt, <a href="https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Content/DE/Artikel/2016/07/2016-07-18-haltung-bundesregierung-tuerkei-todesstrafe.html">adding</a> [statement, in German] that capital punishment is incompatible with the objectives of the EU.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. In May a spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-condemns-iran-sentencing-of-human-rights-activist.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iranian authorities for the sentencing of Nargis Mohammadi, an anti-death penalty activist. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein  <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-chief-welcomes-pfizer-measures-to-prevent-use-of-drugs-for-executions.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the measures being taken by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to prevent the use of its drugs in state-sponsored execution by lethal injection. UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-condemn-belarus-use-of-death-penalty.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] grave concern earlier that month over Belarus' death penalty practices after reports surfaced that a man was executed while his case was before the UN Human Rights Committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=181842&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=91948">found</a> [decision text] that a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] rule generally requiring a so-called "bail-in" for banks receiving state aid is consistent with EU law. The Commission's <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52013XC0730(01)&from=EN">Banking Communication</a> [text, PDF], issued in July 2013, provides that shareholders and subordinated creditors must share the burden of a struggling bank's financial shortfall prior to any state aid being authorized. In the context of a challenge to Slovenia's response to capital shortfalls at five of the country's banks in 2013, the ECJ found that the Commission can require that losses be absorbed by holders of equity as a precondition to public money being made available to shore up a bank's finances. The court also noted that the Banking Communication contains safeguards that empower the Commission to suspend the requirement in the exercise its "broad discretion" when considering a particular Member State's proposed action. Although the decision was prompted by Slovenia's state aid to banks, the ruling is seen to have implications for the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/8/12119242/brexit-italy-eu-crisis">banking crisis</a> [Vox report] in Italy, where the common practice of individuals holding junior debt in banks has made the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/04/economist-explains-2">bail-in</a> [Economist backgrounder] provisions potentially troublesome.</p>

<p>This is the latest development in the ongoing issue of financial stability in the EU. In June, Germany's Federal Constitution Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/germany-court-upholds-ecb-bond-buying-program.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that an unlimited bond-buying program created by the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European Central Bank</a> [official website] complies with German law. In January 2015 EU Advocate General Cruz Villalon <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/eu-legal-advisor-supports-ecbs-bond-purchase-plan.php">gave legal support</a> [JURIST report] to the ECB program as an attempt to remedy the financial crisis in the Eurozone. In September 2014 the EU parliament <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/eu-parliament-approves-new-bank-supervisory-mechanism.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new bank supervisory mechanism. Last November the ECJ <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/eu-court-approves-euro-zone-bailout-fund.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, is in line with European law. The ruling came following several member states' own courts finding the ESM constitutional under their own laws, including <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/estonia-supreme-court-rules-europe-bailout-fund-constitutional.php">Estonia</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/germany-top-court-sides-with-parliament-on-financial-crisis.php">Germany</a> [JURIST reports]. That June the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/eu-proposes-regulations-to-address-future-financial-crises.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a proposal that would address the problems of bailing out large banks with public funds during financial crises in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acting <a href="https://www.justice.gov/osg">US Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn</a> on Monday asked the <a href="http://supremecourt.gov">US Supreme Court</a> [official websites] to <a href="/paperchase/uploads/United_States_v_Texas_Rehearing_Petition.pdf">reconsider</a> [petition, PDF] the case challenging the Obama administration's immigration enforcement program. A divided court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/obama-immigration-policy-remains-blocked-by-divided-supreme-court.php">split 4-4</a> [JURIST report] in June, thereby allowing a <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov">Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] ruling blocking the measures to stand. Recognizing that the court doesn't often grant rehearing, Gershengorn argued that without a definitive ruling on the merits from the court, "a matter of 'great national importance' involving an 'unprecedented and momentous' injunction barring implementation of the Guidance will have been effectively resolved for the country as a whole by a court of appeals that has divided twice, with two judges voting for petitioners and two for respondent States."</p>

<p>The question before the court was whether a state that provides subsidies to undocumented immigrants has standing to challenge the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) [official website] regarding its guidance seeking to establish a process for considering deferred action for more undocumented immigrants. Under the Obama administration, DHS has long utilized a system of "deferred action," meaning it does not pursue deportation for certain illegal immigrants on a discretionary basis. In 2014 <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/secretary">Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson</a> [official profile] issued guidance seeking a deferred action protocol be established for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US for five years and either came here as children or currently have children who are US citizens or permanent residents. Twenty-six states <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/two-states-join-texas-immigration-lawsuit.php">joined a suit</a> [JURIST report] by Texas to challenge this guidance, arguing that the policy will create more immigrants with a deferred action status, and states must sustain a financial burden to maintain these individuals in their state systems. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/federal-judge-blocks-obamas-executive-action-on-immigration.php">blocked the policy</a> [JURIST report] last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Wisconsin court on Tuesday <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/frank-v-walker-preliminary-injunction-motion-granted?redirect=legal-document/frank-v-walker-motion-granted">ordered</a> [order] the state to allow voters who do not have identification to vote in November's general elections. Judge Lynn Alderman's order implemented an "affidavit option" sought by the plaintiffs, in which voters who are not able to obtain ID can still vote if they sign a declaration explaining why they were unable to do so. The judge believes this will "prevent the disenfranchisement  of  some voters" as well as "preserve Wisconsin&#8217;s interests in protecting the integrity of its elections." Some voters, the court found, will be unable to obtain a state ID without going to unreasonable lengths if, for example, they are missing documents, the ID-issuing office makes a clerical error, or they cannot physically travel to one of these offices. This temporary injunction will <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election-idUSKCN10000P">remain in place</a> [Reuters report] until a lawsuit originally filed in 2011 is finalized.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. In May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">provide proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. A federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law in April. Earlier that month a federal appeals court held that the Wisconsin voter ID law needs to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-rules-wisconsin-voter-id-law-must-be-re-examined.php">re-examined</a> [JURIST report]. In March a federal appeals court agreed to <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">reconsider</a> [JURIST report] Texas' voter ID law before the entire court. Last May the New Hampshire Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/new-hampshire-supreme-court-strikes-down-voter-resident-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a 2012 law requiring voters to be state residents, not just domiciled in the state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a> [official website] on Tuesday ordered the immediate release of former  <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=gloria%20arroyo&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo</a> [JURIST news archive], who has been kept in hospital detention for nearly five years on charges of election fraud, plundering, and corruption. The Court, in an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/philippine-supreme-court-clears-president-gloria-macapagal-arroyo-40691184">11-4 decision</a> [AP report], dismissed the charges citing a lack of sufficient evidence. Arroyo <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/ptv/press-release-office-of-rep-gloria-macapagal-arroyo/1222706051123396/">expressed </a>[press release] her appreciation of the decision saying, "I sincerely hope that everyone will respect and recognize the truth that has been established[.]" She also urged people to "[k]eep faith in the justice system."  </p>

<p>Philippine authorities <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/12/philippines-ex-president-faces-new-charges.php">filed a second criminal complaint</a> [JURIST report] against Arroyo in late 2011 for previous charges of corruption and electoral fraud. The second complaint alleged that Arroyo approved a $329-million national broadband network deal with the Chinese company ZTE Corporation in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks in 2008. Arroyo abandoned the deal in 2008 as a result of public pressure. Prosecutors also charged Arroyo's husband Jose Miguel Arroyo, the former Transportation and Communications Secretary Leandro Mendoza and former Commission on Elections Chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr. on related charges. Arroyo was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/11/philippines-ex-president-charged-with-corruption-election-fraud.php">formally charged</a> in November 2011 with corruption and election fraud during her presidency and was arrested the next day on a warrant issued for the charges. Earlier that same week, Arroyo and her husband tried to leave the country after the Philippine Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/Philippine-Supreme-Court-allows-ex-president-Arroyo-to-travel-despite-pending-charges.php">allowed them to travel </a>[JURIST report] despite the pending charges, but were denied transit until they received an official copy of the court order. In July 2010, then-President Benigno Aquino signed an <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">executive order </a> [JURIST report] to set up a "truth commission" to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration engaged in corruption and rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bangladeshi court on Monday officially <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/international/owner-of-rana-plaza-among-41-indicted-in-bangladesh-building-collapse-case-of-2013-116071800864_1.html">indicted</a> [Business Standard report] 41 people with murder stemming from a 2013 garment factory collapse which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 people. Building owner Rohel Sana and his parents were among those charged. Of the 41 charged and indicted, seven are currently in jail and the whereabouts of a further seven are unknown. The trial is set to <a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/country/rana-plaza-collapse-owner-among-41-indicted-murder-case-1255546">begin in September</a> [Daily Star report].</p>

<p>Earlier this year Bangladeshi workers <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/bangladesh-workers-demand-justice-on-anniversary-of-garment-factory-collapse.php">gathered</a> [JURIST report] on the third anniversary of the Rana Plaza garment factory disaster to demand justice for the incident. A court in Dhaka ruled that 41 defendants could be tried for murder for the April 2013 garment factory collapse. Initially charged with culpable homicide, the defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/bangladesh-garment-factory-owners-charged-with-murder-over-worker-deaths.php">charged with murder </a>[JURIST report] upon further investigation of their conduct. Investigators found that the defendants illegally added floors to the original five-story Rana Complex to compete in Bangladesh's highly profitable garment exporting industry. Prior to the building's collapse, the staff allegedly forced workers to stay in the unstable establishment despite concerns that the structure was visibly cracking.  Workers protested  at the grave site where hundreds were buried, demanding justice for the deceased.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal court rules Texas voter ID law violates the Voting Rights Act</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/uploads/Veasey_v_Abbott_Decision.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] on Wednesday that the Texas photo voter identification law, <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=82R&Bill=SB14">SB 14</a> [materials], had a discriminatory effect on minority voters, violating Section 2 of the <a href="https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=100&page=transcript">Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [text]. However, the case was remanded to the district court to reexamine whether its discriminatory purpose was intentional. The district court must now implement a temporary remedy to the voting procedures that would ease the discriminatory effects without causing too much disruption to this year's general elections. The court disagreed with the plaintiffs' claim that the law is a poll tax and also declined to consider whether the law places an undue constitutional burden on voters. </p>

<p>The Texas voter identification law, first passed in 2011, is one of the strictest in the country. The law was blocked by the <a href="http://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website], which previously had the power to review voting changes in some jurisdictions under a preclearance requirement laid out in Sections 4 and 5 of the VRA. However, when the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Section 4 in 2013, there was no longer a basis for enforcing the requirement in those jurisdictions. Texas lawmakers announced their plans to reenact the voting law hours after the Court's decision. In October 2014, a district court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-texas-voter-id-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that SB 14 violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the US Constitution and <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-blocks-texas-voter-id-law.php">filed a permanent injunction</a> [JURIST report] against its enforcement days later. However, an appeals court temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-texas-voter-id-law.php">reinstated</a> [JURIST report] the law, stating that the upcoming elections were too close to make a change and the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/supreme-court-allows-texas-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">permitted</a> [JURIST report] the law to be enforced. In March, the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to reconsider Texas' voter identification law before the entire court, as opposed to a panel of just three judges. That month, the League of United Latin American Citizens and Congressman Marc Veasy, along with other plaintiffs, <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/voters-ask-supreme-court-to-block-texas-voter-id-law.php">filed an application</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court, asking the Court to vacate a stay that allowed the voter ID law to remain in place during the 2014 midterm elections. The Court did not vacate the stay, but stated that if the Appeals Court did not make a ruling in this case by July 20th, then the parties could seek relief from the Supreme Court. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cookcountycourt.org/HOME.aspx">Cook County Circuit Court</a> [official website] Judge Diane Larsen on Wednesday <a href="/paperchase/uploads/Hooker_v_Board_of_Elections_decision.pdf">blocked</a> [opinion, PDF] a ballot measure proposing an amendment to the Illinois Consitution that aimed to eliminate the General Assembly's power to draw legislative district boundaries. The proposal advanced by <a href="http://www.mapamendment.org/index.html">Independent Maps</a> (IM) [advocacy website] seeks to change the current process to avoid a situation where the redistricting and approval could fall into the hands of elected officials of the same party. Under IM's proposal, the General Assembly's current power to submit a redistricting plan would be removed, and a new Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) created in its place. The plan also envisions a <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-redistricting-lawsuit-ruling-madigan-met-20160720-story.html">new and increased role</a> [Chicago Tribune report] for the state Auditor General, and additional responsibilities for the individual justices of the Illinois Supreme Court. Larsen ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on seven of the eleven counts challenging the proposal, ultimately rejecting the redistricting amendment.  Among other things, she stated that "the requirement that at least two Illinois Supreme Court justices not have the same political affiliation adds a new eligibility requirement for the office of Judge of the Illinois Supreme Court ... and is unconstitutional on that basis." The court also found the additional duties created for the Illinois Supreme Court justices and the Auditor General to be a violation of Article XIV of the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/commission/lrb/conent.htm">Illinois Constitution</a> [text].  According to the court, neither the Supreme Court justices nor the Auditor General are representatives of the legislative branch, and thus outside the scope of Article IV of the Constitution governing legislative redistricting.  Dennis FitzSimons, chairman of IM, stated his intention to <a href="http://www.mapamendment.org/news/10590">appeal</a> [press release] the ruling in an effort to keep the referendum on the November 8 ballot.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Earlier this week, courts in <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/wisconsin-court-order-relaxes-voter-id-law-for-november-election.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/federal-court-holds-texas-voter-id-law-had-discriminatory-effect.php">Texas</a> [JURIST reports] invalidated state voter ID laws. Last month, a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/three-judge-panel-upholds-north-carolinas-newly-drawn-voting-districts.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's newly drawn congressional districts. In April the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a redistricting decision in Arizona as not discriminatory. Earlier that same month a panel of federal judges <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article72552187.ece/BINARY/Order%20in%20Brown's%20case.pdf">rejected a motion</a> [order, PDF] by <a href="https://corrinebrown.house.gov/">Representative Corrine Brown</a> [official profile] challenging the current <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-court-refuses-to-alter-florida-congressional-district-boundaries.php">congressional district boundaries in Florida</a> [JURIST report]. In March the Supreme Court heard <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-extraterritoriality.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding an election district plan for Virginia's Third Congressional District. This district was altered in 2012 in a manner that increased the already majority-African American population, and the district court found the plan unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. In November the court heard <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-three-judge-rule-for-redistricting-cases.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a challenge to the Three Judge Court Act, which requires the convening of a three-judge district court to decide certain important lawsuits such as those concerning voter redistricting. Last June the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-states-may-use-commissions-for-redistricting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Elections Clause of the US Constitution permits the state of Arizona to adopt a commission to draw congressional districts. In April of last year the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-throws-out-ruling-on-north-carolina-redistricting.php">threw out</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina court ruling that upheld Republican-drawn electoral districts for state and congressional lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.knesset.gov.il/main/eng/home.asp">Israeli Knesset</a> [official website] voted 62-45 on Wednesday to <a href="https://www.knesset.gov.il/spokesman/eng/PR_eng.asp?PRID=12182">enable it to impeach legislators</a> [press release] for inciting racism or supporting armed struggle against the state. Impeachment under the new law would reach the full Knesset after referral from a parliamentary committee, and require the approval of 90 of the Knesset's 120 lawmakers. The decision to launch impeachment proceedings would itself require 70 votes, including at least 10 from opposition MKs. <a href="http://www.pmo.gov.il/English/Pages/default.aspx">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official website] said that the new law was necessary to <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-approves-bill-to-remove-lawmakers-from-office/">prevent supporters of terrorism</a> [Times of Israel report] against the state to serve in its parliament. Critics have <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.732525">attacked</a> [Haaretz report] the bill as mainly targeting Arab legislators. According to Debbie Gilad-Hayo of the <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/en/">Association of Civil Rights in Israel</a> (ACRI) [official website], the new law is a <a href="http://www.acri.org.il/en/2016/07/19/update-mk-suspension-bill/">"slippery slope"</a> [press release] that "provides members of Knesset with the power to dismiss serving MKs for political reasons." The practical effect of the law has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-politics-idUSKCN1000Q3">been questioned</a> [Reuters report] by those who see the 90-vote threshold as a potentially limiting factor.</p>

<p>A number of controversial Israeli laws in the recent past have prompted criticism from the UN and the international community. Last week, Israel lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/israel-passes-law-increasing-regulation-on-human-rights-organizations.php">enacted a law</a> [JURIST report] increasing regulation on Israeli human rights organizations. The law requires organizations receiving more than 50 percent of their funding from foreign governments or political organizations to disclose their reliance on such funding in "all communication with public officials and on television, newspapers, billboards and online." Last month, the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-cautions-israel-against-violating-international-law-in-response-to-attacks----dnp.php">cautioned Israel</a> [JURIST report] that their response to a deadly Tel Aviv attack may be violating international law by implementing prohibitive collective punishment. In January, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territories Makarim Wibisono <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory after repeated requests. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Hong Kong court on Thursday found three leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy protests guilty on charges related to their occupation of a government building. Joshua Wong and Alex Chow, prominent leaders of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/-sp-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-pro-democracy-protests">Umbrella Revolution</a> [Guardian backgrounder], were convicted of <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-crime/article/1992665/guilty-hong-kong-student-leader-joshua-wong-and-associates">unlawful assembly</a> [South China Morning Post report], while a third activist, Nathan Law, was found to have incited others to join that unlawful assembly. The charges stem from <a href="http://time.com/3632739/hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-photos/">79 days</a> [Time report] of street protests in Hong Kong, during which time pro-democracy protesters <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/11/hong-kong-court-notice-allows-authorities-to-start-clearing-protest-sites.php">occupied</a> [JURIST report] a number of public roads and buildings. Wong and Law are currently the leaders of the <a href="https://www.demosisto.hk/">Demosisto</a> [party website, in Chinese] political party and were planning to stand for legislative elections in November. The three activists are <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-36852731">scheduled to be sentenced</a> [BBC report] next month, subject to a maximum fine of HK$5,000 and up to three years in prison.</p>

<p>China's human rights record has garnered international attention for the government's treatment of the growing <a href="/forum/2014/10/shubhankar-dam-hong-kong.php">civil rights movement</a> [JURIST op-ed] in the country, led by a number of prominent rights activists and attorneys. In January, Chinese authorities <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/china-authorities-charge-detained-lawyers-reports.php">brought charges</a> [JURIST report] against seven lawyers from the Beijing Fengrui Law Firm related to events that have allegedly disrupted the public order, including a police shooting. Chinese state media <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/china-state-media-detained-lawyers-threatened-rule-of-law.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] detained human rights lawyers for undermining the rule of law last year. In December, prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang was <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/prominent-china-rights-lawyer-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] after receiving a suspended sentence. Pu was <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/china-detains-rights-lawyer-ahead-of-tiananmen-square-anniversary.php">detained</a> in 2014 on a charge of "causing a disturbance" after he attended a weekend meeting that urged an investigation into the 1989 crackdown of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and was subsequently <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/china-court-denies-bail-to-human-rights-lawyer.php">denied </a>[JURIST reports] bail. The Tiananmen protests began in April 1989 with mainly students and laborers protesting the Communist Party of China. The Chinese government declared martial law in May and initiated the violent dispersal of protesters by the People's Liberation Army on June 4. The Chinese government has never publicized official figures, but the Hong Kong-based <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/">Information Center for Human Rights & Democracy</a> [advocacy website] reported last year that unnamed sources had <a href="http://www.hkhkhk.com/main/messages/16647.html">estimated 600 people were killed</a> [ICHR report, in Chinese].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani <a href="http://mofa.gov.pk/content.php?pageID=adviser">Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="http://mofa.gov.pk/pr-details.php?mm=NDAwNg,,">announced</a> [press release] his country's intention to ask the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> (UNHRC) [official website] to send a fact-finding mission to <a href="https://www.jurist.org/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=kashmir&IncludeBlogs=2">Kashmir</a> [JURIST news archive] following recent civil unrest in the disputed region. Authorities used <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/12/in-kashmir-indian-security-forces-use-pellet-guns-that-often-blind-protesters/">less-lethal pellet guns</a> [WP report] during attempts to quell civil unrest in the Indian-administered territory, which Aziz described as "lethal force." Aziz asserted that the use of such force "against the innocent civilians, protesting peacefully over extrajudicial killings, is deplorable and constitutes blatant violation of International Human Rights and Humanitarian laws." Pakistan intends to ask the UNHRC to send a fact-finding mission to determine if Indian authorities violated international norms and to impose a ban on the use of pellet guns for crowd control.</p>

<p>The disposition of Kashmir is a recurring source of tension between India and Pakistan. Earlier this month, Pakistan <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/pakistan-accuses-india-of-human-rights-violations-in-kashmir.php#">accused</a> [JURIST report] India of human rights violations after a clash between the Indian army and pro-independence rebels, which lead to the death of militant commander  Burhan Wani of group <a href="http://hizbmedia.org/Introduction.php">Hizbul Mujahideen</a> [official website]. Continued unrest following the clash preceded the use of force on which Pakistan now seeks UNHRC action. In March, the Delhi High Court in India <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/india-student-leader-charged-with-sedition-granted-bail.php">granted bail</a> [JURIST report] to a student political leader arrested for rallying against the execution of Kashmiri separatist Mohammed Afzal Guru. The government justified the arrests of rallying students on the grounds that they supported the Kashmiri separatist movement and the break-up of India. In October 2014, Pakistan asked Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/pakistan-asks-un-for-border-protection.php">assistance in border protection</a> [JURIST report] after at least 14 people were shot and killed near Kashmir. In June 2015 independent UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/un-rights-experts-pakistan-must-pass-measures-to-protect-minorities.php">urged </a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to adopt urgent legislation to put an end to faith-based killings and protect the country's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8711026.stm">Ahmadiyya Muslim</a> [BBC profile] community.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Software developer Bitmanagement Software GmbH has <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">filed</a> [complaint, PDF] a lawsuit against the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/">United States Navy</a> [official website] in the <a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/">United States Court of Federal Claims</a> [official website]. In its complaint, the German software company claims the Navy infringed copyrights owned by Bitmanagement Software GmbH, in particular through copying and installing the company's three-dimensional virtual reality software - BS Contact Geo- onto "hundreds of thousands of computers for which the Navy does not have a license," to aid in flight simulator training. The company had agreed to allow the Navy to use their software on a trial basis, limiting the number of installations of the program to 38 computers, and, at the Navy's request, the company removed its control mechanism for tracking and limiting the software's use so as to "facilitate such testing and integration of the software on Navy computers in preparation for the large scale licensing." The company contends the "Flexwrap" program, which would have tracked the Navy's use and duplication of the program on Navy computers, was removed by the Navy. According to the complaint, during later negotiations between the company and the Navy, and without the company's consent, the Navy installed BS Contact Geo onto hundreds of thousands of computers, infringing upon US <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1498">copyright law</a> [materials]. Bitmanagement Software GmbH seeks "an amount not less than $596,308,103."</p>

<p>Intellectual property rights remain to be a significant issue throughout the world. Last month the Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/apple-ordered-to-stop-sale-of-iphone6-and-iphone-6-plus-in-beijing.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Apple to stop sale of the Iphone 6 and Iphone 6 Plus for violating a Chinese company's patent on exterior design. In May a US jury concluded that Google <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/05/federal-jury-rules-for-google-in-copyright-battle-against-oracle.php">had not violated copyright laws</a> [JURIST report] where it used another companies programming language to develop its Android operating system. Earlier that same month the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">United States Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-to-rule-on-copyright-protections-for-cheerleader-uniforms.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] to hear a copyright case which would further elucidate when the feature of a useful article is protectable under a section of the Copyright Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Jersey court rules use of high beams insufficient for police detention</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday the <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/supreme/">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> [official website] ruled in <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/supreme/A1115SvA.pdf">State v. Al-Sharif Scriven</a> [opinion, PDF] that the use of high beams on an automobile does not present enough reasonable suspicion for a police officer to stop the vehicle. The officer, on foot, had originally stopped the car in which Mr. Scriven was a passenger for supposedly violating a statute that forbids the use of high beams when approaching an oncoming vehicle. The court held that the <a href="https://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/mcs/svbs_5-02/title_39.pdf">statute in question</a> [N.J.S.A. 39:3-60, PDF] only applied to vehicles, and that a police officer on foot did not fall under that category. Therefore, the contraband found after a search incident to arrest under N.J.S.A. 39 was held to be inadmissible under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a> [text] to the Constitution.      </p>

<p>This ruling comes in a string of incidents relating to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/north-carolina-governor-signs-law-requiring-a-court-order-to-obtain-police-body-camera-footage.php">police responsibilities</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/doj-to-investigate-baton-rouge-police-killing-of-black-man.php">police actions</a>, and the extent to which <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/baltimore-judge-denies-motion-to-drop-charges-against-police-in-freddie-gray-trial.php">police may stop a citizen</a> [JURIST reports]. In particular, State v. Scriven comes after the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov">United States Supreme Court </a> [official website] ruled on another Fourth Amendment case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1373_83i7.pdf">Utah v. Strieff</a> [opinion, PDF], that found that an outstanding arrest warrant counts as an intervening cause to purge evidence found through <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-allows-use-of-evidence-after-unlawful-stop.php">unlawful police activity of any taint</a> [JURIST report]. In that case the police received an anonymous tip that narcotics were being sold in a house, and the house was put under surveillance for suspicious activity. During the surveillance, a detective stopped Edward Strieff while he was exiting the house to ask some questions. The detective asked for ID and ran a warrant check, which returned a "small traffic warrant." The detective arrested Strieff and found drug paraphernalia incident to the arrest. Strieff argued that the initial stop was illegal since the detective did not have reasonable suspicion.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The<a href="https://www.eff.org"> Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) [official website] filed a <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/21/1201_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] today in the<a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov"> United States District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] challenging the &#8220;anti-circumvention&#8221; and &#8220;anti-trafficking&#8221; provisions of the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (DMCA) [act, PDF]. The complaint alleges that the act infringes on the rights of citizens of the United States to "tinker" with lawfully purchased machinery or software or to conduct research that could expose security and operation flaws in cars and medical devices.   </p>

<p>Copyright issues have become especially prevalent in the digital age, especially as users of technology have become more adept at modifying and customizing their devices. The tech giant <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-jury-rules-for-google-in-copyright-battle-against-oracle.php">Google</a> has been <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-rules-in-favor-of-google-in-java-case.php">embroiled</a> in <a href="/paperchase/2010/04/done-germany-high-court-rule-google-did-not-violate-copyright-laws.php">copyright litigation</a> for the <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/federal-judge-dismisses-google-books-copyright-infringement-case.php">past several years</a> against multiple companies [JURIST reports]. In 2015, a judge for the <a href="https://www.cacd.uscourts.gov">US District Court for the Central District of California</a> [offical website] <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/happy-birthday-ruling/">invalidated</a> [opinion] the copyright claim to the lyrics of the song <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-judge-invalidates-happy-birthday-copyright.php">"Happy Birthday."</a> [JURIST report] Earlier that year, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12567649168680108221&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">ruled against</a> [opinion] <a href="http://www.universalmusic.com">Universal Music Group</a> [website] in a lawsuit also brought by EFF concerning fair use after Universal demanded YouTube take down the video of a child dancing to Prince's song "Let's go crazy." The case, <u>Lenz v. Universal Music Corp</u>, also revolved around the First Amendment and the DMCA. The previous July, <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/pirate-bay-founders-acquitted-in-belgium-copyright-case.php">a Belgian court found</a> [JURIST report] that the founders of the file-sharing website Pirate Bay were not guilty of copyright infringement.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/appellate_trial_courts/supremecourt/">Washington Supreme Court</a> [official website] Thursday <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/918279.pdf">found an antibegging ordinance</a> [text, PDF] under the <a href="mailto:http://municode.cityoflakewood.us/">Lakewood Municipal Code</a> [materials] to be unconstitutional on <a href="https://www.jurist.org/documents/constitutions/united_states.php#amendment_i">First Amendment</a> [text] grounds. The court found that the ordinance restricted protected speech in a public forum and was therefore invalid. The restrictions, which the court referred to as "content-based," prohibited begging in several areas such as ramps, intersections, bus stops, or within 25 feet of an ATM.  </p>

<p>Robert Willis was convicted in 2012 under the ordinance. He was arrested for reportedly walking in and out of the lanes of traffic on an exit ramp. He had a sign with him requesting help. Willis was charged with "Begging In Restrictive Areas" and he was sentenced to the maximum-90 days in jail and a $1000 fine.  The jail time and $750 of the fine were ultimately suspended. Willis argued that the code violated his free speech and that it was unconstitutionally vague. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] On Thursday Indonesian officials <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/indonesia-rejects-ruling-1960s-mass-killing-160721104600825.html">rejected</a> [Aljazeera report] the findings of the international people's tribunal formed at the Hague that Indonesia had committed crimes against humanity in killing the country's communist party members and followers in the 1960s. The tribunal had <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/07/20/tribunal-says-indonesia-responsible-for-genocide-in-1965.html">held Idonesia was responsible</a> [Jakarta Post report] for over 400,000 killings, and the tribunal called upon the state to investigate into the situation and prosecute those responsible. The country's Security Minister Luhut Panjaitan denounced the tribunal's findings, stating the matter was "none of their business," and the foreign ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said the tribunals suggestions were "not legally binding." Despite the tribunal's report lacking legal staying-power, some believe the report will place pressure on the government to address the issues. The report also accused the United States of complicity in the killings, while also condemning Great Britain and Australia for recycling Indonesia's anti-communism propaganda.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.komnasham.go.id/">Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission</a> [official website, in Indonesian] released a <a href="http://www.komnasham.go.id/sites/default/files/dok-publikasi/EKSEKUTIF%20SUMMARY%20PERISTIWA%201965.pdf">report</a> [executive summary, PDF, in Indonesian] in 2012, which found that the mass killings constituted gross human rights violations. The government dismissed the report's findings and refused to take further action. The killings followed a fail coup attempt and led to the downfall of President Sukarno and the beginning of of Suharto's 30-year rule. Rights activists also blame the US, UK and Australia for complicity in the killings by providing support to Suharto's forces.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals </a> [website] Wednesday reopened<a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/16a0167p-06.pdf"></a> [opinion, text] a complaint by the <a href="https://www.opers.org/">Ohio Public Employees Retirement System</a> (OPERS) [website] against mortgage giant, <a href="http://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> [website]. The complaint, based on Third Amendment grounds, was originally filed in 2008. OPERS is a state-pension plan for Ohio employees which purchased stock in Freddie Mac in 2006 and 2007. The complaint alleged that Freddie Mac engaged in "permissive purchasing strategies" when it began to heavily deal in "subprime-like" loans in the mid 2000's. OPERS claims that this practice resulted in lower standards of review and subsequently insufficient evaluation and fraud detection software. Initially, a lower court threw out the complaint for failure to allege loss causation. This court found, however, that when "[t]aking the allegations in the Complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in OPERS&#8217;s favor" the alleged loss causation had been sufficiently proven.  </p>

<p>In 2012 the <a href="http://www.fhfa.gov/">Federal Housing Finance Agency</a> [official website] (FHFA), acting in its capacity as conservator for Freddie Mac, reached a <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/us-government-reaches-51-billion-settlement-with-jpmorgan.php">settlement </a>[JURIST report] with <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMorgan Chase & Co.</a> [corporate website] for $480 million. The FHFA accused JPMorgan of misrepresenting the quality of sub-prime mortgages sold to Freddie Mac. The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/fbi-investigating-major-financial.php">began an investigation</a> [JURIST report] in September 2008 of 26 financial institutions for possible mortgage fraud, including Freddie Mac. That same month, Freddie Mac's share prices plummeted after its financial weakness was revealed to the public, leading the company to be placed under government custody. More recently, the effects of the 2008 financial crisis are still reverberating through the legal system. In April a federal judge unsealed an <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-overturns-metlife-too-big-to-fail-designation.php">opinion</a> [JURIST report] from late March ruling that the government did not have grounds to designate the major insurance company, <a href="https://www.metlife.com/campaign/life-insurance/simplified/index.html?WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=cs380125&utm_campaign=sit_st_d&utm_id=cs380125&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_content=bd&pagefrom=MLPS_life-insurance&u=99894697-vq6-110903541204-vq16-c&dclid=CL-7tqyvh84CFc1ENwodEgYFMg">Metlife</a> [website], as "too big to fail," a designation only four firms have received. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Today the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website] Managing Director <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-13452436">Christine Lagarde</a> [BBC profile] was <a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_2/assemblee_pleniere_22/629_22_34899.html">ordered</a> [decision, PDF, in French] by a French court to face criminal trial for her negligence in facilitating a $400 million government payout to French businessman, and Nicolas Sarkozy supporter, Bernard Tapie. Lagarde is accused of allowing Tapie's case to be decided upon by an arbitration panel, as opposed to the courts, during her time as France's Finance Minister under then president Nicolas Sarkozy. Following this decision, Lagarde is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-22/imf-s-lagarde-loses-fight-to-avoid-french-trial-in-tapie-case-iqxpe6ak">expected to stand trial</a> [Bloomberg report] before the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/fr/">Cour de Justice</a> [official website, in French], which specializes in trying government officials accused of crimes related to their government positions. Lagarde's lawyer stated he was "convinced that the court will find the allegations of negligence to be without merit" and the IMF executive board voiced its utmost confidence in Lagarde's ability to perform her duties as Managing Director.</p>

<p>In 2011 a French court had <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/08/france-court-orders-probe-of-new-imf-chief.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a formal investigation into Lagarde's involvement in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35126472">Tapie's arbitration agreement</a> [BBC backgrounder]. Tapie had initially sued France for compensation after he claims a state-owned bank, <a href="http://www.lcl.com/fr/">Credit Lyonnais</a> [official website], defrauded him and sold his stock in Adidas at a much higher value. While Tapie had initially won a $400 million settlement through the arbitration, that decision was overturned and he has since been ordered to reimburse the state. Tapie has appealed the decision and the case is still pending.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] On Thursday, Michigan Attorney General spokesman John Sellek said that Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette and Secretary of State Ruth Johnson <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/state_to_appeal_bizarre_ruling.html">plan to appeal</a> [Michigan Live article] an <a href="http://media.mlive.com/news_impact/other/Injunction.pdf">injunction</a> [decision, PDF] on the state's <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/publicact/pdf/2015-PA-0268.pdf">law</a> [law, PDF] eliminating straight-ticket voting. In his 37-page decision, <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division</a> [official website] Judge Gershwin A. Drain enjoined enforcement of the law, stating that the ban on straight-ticket voting, which violates Equal Protection and the <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act</a> [law, PDF], is "caused by or linked to social and historical conditions that have produced or currently produce discrimination against African Americans." The decision relied upon a report which links straight-ticket voting, generally for Democrats, to higher populations of African Americans within a community. Many Michigan Republicans believe the injunction reflects "the corrupt era of party bosses that hasn't existed for one hundred years" and leaves the state's citizens with an outdated ballot system. Michigan House Speaker Kevin Cotter stated that "[a]n objective evaluation of the constitutionality of the more modern ballot, already adopted by 40 other states, would have resulted in a very different outcome."</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Yesterday, a judge <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/cook-county-judge-blocks-illinois-redistricting-ballot-measure.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a ballot measure proposing to amend the Illinois Constitution to eliminate the General Assembly's power to draw legislative districts. Earlier this week, courts in <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/wisconsin-court-order-relaxes-voter-id-law-for-november-election.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/federal-court-holds-texas-voter-id-law-had-discriminatory-effect.php">Texas</a> [JURIST reports] invalidated state voter ID laws. Last month, a three-judge panel <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/three-judge-panel-upholds-north-carolinas-newly-drawn-voting-districts.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's newly drawn congressional districts. In April the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a redistricting decision in Arizona as not discriminatory. Earlier that same month a panel of federal judges <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article72552187.ece/BINARY/Order%20in%20Brown's%20case.pdf">rejected a motion</a> [order, PDF] by <a href="https://corrinebrown.house.gov/">Representative Corrine Brown</a> [official profile] challenging the current <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/04/federal-court-refuses-to-alter-florida-congressional-district-boundaries.php">congressional district boundaries in Florida</a> [JURIST report]. In March the Supreme Court heard <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-redistricting-extraterritoriality.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] regarding an election district plan for Virginia's Third Congressional District. This district was altered in 2012 in a manner that increased the already majority-African American population, and the district court found the plan unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. In November the court heard <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-three-judge-rule-for-redistricting-cases.php">oral arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a challenge to the Three Judge Court Act, which requires the convening of a three-judge district court to decide certain important lawsuits such as those concerning voter redistricting. Last June the court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-states-may-use-commissions-for-redistricting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Elections Clause of the US Constitution permits the state of Arizona to adopt a commission to draw congressional districts. In April of last year the court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-throws-out-ruling-on-north-carolina-redistricting.php">threw out</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina court ruling that upheld Republican-drawn electoral districts for state and congressional lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] According to a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/07/21/you-dont-exist/arbitrary-detentions-enforced-disappearances-and-torture-eastern">56-page report</a> [report] by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [official website] and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [official website], Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in the Ukraine have subjected citizen to "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including refusing necessary medical attention. The report examined nine instances of arbitrary, prolonged detention of citizens by both Ukrainian authorities and pro-Kiev Russia-backed separatists over the course of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. Ukrainian forces initially detain the citizens and turn the citizens over to the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), where they are eventually put into the normal criminal justice system. While in SBU incommunicado detention, however, these citizens have been faced with beatings, electric shocks, threats of rape, execution and retaliation against family members. Likewise, those captured by Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), pro-Kiev security forces, faced incommunicado detainment and were subjected to inhumane treatment. The report urges both groups to end the forced, arbitrary detainments, ill-treatment, and torture, and to investigate and take appropriate actions against those responsible for these practices.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In June the OHCHR reported that the human rights situation in Ukraine <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/un-ukraine-rights-violations-persist.php">remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia. In February Russia <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/02/russia-files-lawsuit-against-ukraine-over-3-billion-eurobond-debt.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Ukraine over Ukraine's default on $3 billion in bonds. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">plans to sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] on claims of financing terrorism. In August a Russian military court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Ukrainian activists to substantial jail time for the charge of conspiring to commit terror attacks. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its policy of <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">refusing to recognize Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report]. In February 2015 Russian liberal political activist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31669061">Boris Nemtsov was shot in the back four times</a> [BBC report] in the middle of busy downtown Moscow. Nemtsov was openly politically opposed to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>DOJ brings suit against Pennsylvania township for denying zoning approval to mosque</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] On Thursday the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [complaint] filed a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/878146/download">complaint</a> [complaint, PDF] against Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania for denying zoning approval to a mosque in 2014. The complaint alleges that the township violated the federal <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-42-public-health-and-welfare">Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act</a> [materials] after the board rejected the Bensalem Masjid's requested zoning variance to build a mosque on three adjoining properties in the "Business and Professional district." Under the town ordinances, religious institutions are only permitted to be in the "institutional district." The DOJ alleges that rejection of the variance application constitutes a "substantial burden on Bensalem Masjid's religious exercise, which burden is not in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest" or achieved through the least restrictive means possible. It is also alleged that, because other religious institutions have been granted zoning variances to build in areas other than institutional districts, Bensalem Township has discriminated against the Bensalem Masjid because of his religious belief. The DOJ seeks to obtain a court order to compel the city to approve the mosque and also seeks further, unspecified monetary damages.</p>

<p>Bensalem Township's decision to deny the Bensalem Masjid's variance application, despite granting similar variances to Christian and other religious institutions, is far from unheard of. In 2014 in Kennesaw, Georgia, the Kennesaw City Council <a href="https://www.jurist.org/hotline/2015/01/azadeh-shahshahani-mosque-controversy.php">refused to issue a permit</a> [JURIST commentary] to build a mosque in a "retail only district" despite having down so for a Pentecostal church prior. The city council overturned its decision after the DOJ threatened file suit against the city. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] California <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19488">signed</a> [official news report] a law which would require individuals to apply for a state-issued firearm registration number where they made their own weapons with parts they have purchased or found. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml">Assembly Bill 857</a> [statute, PDF] will allow the state to keep track of weapons that individuals make on their own, furthering California's strict stance on gun-control. Over the past month, Brown has <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/california-governor-signs-gun-control-laws.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] a variety of restrictions on guns, including a ban on semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines and background checks for individuals purchasing ammunition.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Last month the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-upholds-firearm-prohibitions-for-reckless-domestic-violence.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] 6-2 that a state law conviction on reckless domestic assault is sufficient to bar possession of a firearm under federal law. Earlier in June Hawaii Governor David Ige <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/hawaii-governor-signs-bill-to-put-gun-owners-on-fbi-database.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring gun owners to be listed on an FBI database, notifying police if a Hawaii citizen is arrested in another state and providing a continuous criminal record check on those individuals seeking to possess a firearm. Also in June, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-assault-weapons-bans.php">denied certiorari</a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases challenging bans on assault-style weapons. The court denied the appeals without comment, letting stand lower court rulings that had <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld the bans</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional. In response to the mass killing in Orlando in June, the UN's top human rights official <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-chief-calls-for-increased-gun-control-in-us.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its gun control measures. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-authorities-may-require-permits-for-concealed-handguns-in-public.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in June that the right to carry a concealed gun is not within Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Tayyip Erdogan <a href="http://aa.com.tr/en/todays-headlines/turkey-shuts-down-over-2-000-gulen-linked-institutions-/613991">ordered</a> [Anadolu Agency report] the closure of thousands of private schools, charities and other institutions on Saturday. Mr. Erdogan alleges Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen of orchestrating last week's failed coup and the schools and other institutions are suspected by Turkish authorities of having links to the US-based preacher. 1,043 private schools, 1,229 charities and foundations, 19 trade unions, 15 universities, and 35 medical institutions will be closed. Mr. Gulen operates some schools and charitable foundations in the country. One foundation <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-security-emergency-idUSKCN1030BC">targeted</a> [Reuters report] is "a secular group that criticized a recent judicial law drafted by Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK party," the Association of Judges and Prosecutors.</p>

<p>Mr. Erdogan has vowed that those involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">coup</a> [JURIST report] will "pay a heavy price" and the aftermath of the coup may be bloody and repressive as the state of human rights has been controversial in Turkey for years. This week, President Erdogan stated that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">approve reinstating </a>[JURIST report] the death penalty so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly. Last week, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-turkey-preventing-independent-investigation-into-mass-abuses-against-civilians.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report stating that Turkey has blocked access for independent investigations into mass abuses against civilians. In 2015, then-Human Rights Commissioner for Germany <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/germany-commissioner-says-turkey-does-not-belong-in-eu.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey must improve its human rights record before it can be admitted to the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge on Friday <a href="https://www.thomasmoresociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/160721-Wieland-Memo-Ord-Summ-Jdgt-Granted-dkt-86.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of a Missouri lawmaker "who cited religious objections while challenging the inclusion of birth control coverage in his government-provided health insurance." The <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-law/read-the-law/">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) requires that health insurance issuers provide minimum essential coverage to women- including coverage for all contraceptive methods and sterilization procedures provided by the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA). The lawsuit began when Catholic Senator Paul Wieland and his wife filed suit against the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">United States Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS), the government agency that enforces the ACA, alleging that participating in a healthcare plan that "includes coverage for contraceptives violates their sincerely-held religious beliefs." The federal judge concluded that the ACA's requirement that includes contraceptive methods 'substantially burdens' the Wieland's exercise of religion against the <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/00100003021.HTML">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) because they either have to drop their insurance and pay thousands of dollars per year or leave their children without health insurance. The decision may be appealed by the government.</p>

<p>The debate over abortion law and women's right of access to contraceptives has gathered a lot of international attention in recent years. Last month, the Supreme Court of the United States <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-denies-cert-in-religious-objection-to-birth-control-case.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in a case challenging a Washington regulation requiring pharmacies to sell birth control despite potential religious objections of employees. Also last month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/aclu-challenges-us-on-reproductive-health-rights-for-immigrant-minors.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the HHS for allowing religious agencies taking in refugees to refuse female immigrant minors access to reproductive health services, including abortions and birth control. In May, the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-sends-contraception-cases-back-to-lower-courts.php">remanded</a> [JURIST report] a group of cases challenging the birth control mandate in the ACA to the lower courts for further proceeding- citing the RFRA. In April, Lisa C. Ikemoto of the University of California-Davis School of Law <a href="/forum/2016/04/lisa-ikemoto-zubik-burwell.php">discussed</a> [JURIST Commentary report] with JURIST the latest ACA challenge to appear in front of the US Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a 4-3 ruling on Friday, the <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/scv/home.html">Virginia Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1160784.pdf">held</a> [opinion, PDF] that <a href="https://governor.virginia.gov/">Governor Terry McAuliffe's</a> [official website] <a href="http://commonwealth.virginia.gov/media/5848/order_restoring_rights_4-22-16.pdf">executive order</a> [order, PDF] granting a blanket restoration of the state's felon voting rights is unconstitutional.  The voter-disqualification provision in <a href="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section1/">Article II of Virginia's Constitution</a> [text] provides that "[n]o person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to vote unless his civil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority."  Article II also enables the Governor to consider and act on any request from felons to have their voting rights restored.   Noting that "All prior Governors exercised their clemency powers &#8212; including pardons, reprieves, commutations, and restorations&#8212; on an individualized case-by-case basis taking into account the specific circumstances of each," the Court stated that "we are aware of no point in the history of the Commonwealth that any Governor has even asserted the power to issue ... sua sponte clemency order of any kind, whether to restore civil rights or grant a pardon, to an entire class of unnamed felons without regard for the nature of the crimes or any other individual circumstances relevant to the request." The civil rights restored by Governor McAuliffe's order included the rights to vote, hold public office, serve on a jury, and to act as a notary public.  The governor <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/07/22/487107922/virginia-court-overturns-order-that-restored-voting-rights-to-felons">previously noted</a> [NPR news report] the racial injustice that resulted from depriving felons of the right to vote, given the higher incarceration rates of African-American communities.  He also stated in an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/22/475311862/virginia-governor-restores-voting-rights-to-ex-felons">interview to NPR</a> [Interview transcripts, text], "I mean, they've served their time. They're done with the system .... People make mistakes in life. You shouldn't have to live with that for the rest of your life. I believe in redemption."</p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Last month a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Earlier in May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter identification law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to provide <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. In April a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voter ID law. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">bill that will allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a 4-1 opinion on Friday, the <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/ctinfo.htm">Alaska Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.courtrecords.alaska.gov/webdocs/opinions/ops/sp-7114.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that the state's parental "notification law" requiring doctors to inform the parents of minors seeking an abortion is unconstitutional, and cannot be enforced. The Court stated that "we are not concerned with whether abortion is right, wrong, moral, or immoral, or with whether abortions should be available to minors without restriction.  We are concerned only with whether, <em>given its stated underlying justifications</em>, the current Notification Law complies with the Alaska Constitution&#8217;s equal protection guarantee &#8212; and it does not."  Alaska's parental notification law applies to un-emancipated, unmarried minors, and includes specific requirements for parental notification, a 48-hour mandatory waiting period between parental notification and the termination of a minor&#8217;s pregnancy, and criminal and civil penalties for any physician who fails to comply with the notification requirements in terminating a minor&#8217;s pregnancy. </p>

<p>Abortion in general continues to be a highly controversial subject in the US.  Earlier this month a US district judge issued a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-blocks-florida-efforts-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against a law intended to cut state funding to clinics administering abortions. That same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-federal-court-blocks-state-abortion-bill.php">placed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on an Indiana law that would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. Recently the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">Texas law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website] released a <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=9901">statement</a> [text] on Friday condemning the <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54530#.V5TB2_mAOko">recent fighting in Kidal, Mali</a> [UN News Centre report]. The fighting arose at the end of last week between the Platform Movement and the Coordination of movements of Azawad (CMA), two signatories to the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. The Secretary General, along with the <a href="http://minusma.unmissions.org/en">Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali</a> (MINUSMA) [official website], are calling for <a href="http://minusma.unmissions.org/en/minusma-calls-immediate-cessation-hostilities-kidal">restored peace</a> [MINUSMA statement] after this first violation of the country's ceasefire in September 2015.</p>

<p>Mali has been facing a humanitarian crisis since 2012 that has raised grave international concerns. Most recently, in April 2015 Ban Ki-Moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-expresses-concern-over-attacks-targeted-at-peacekeepers.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over attacks in Mali in which members of MINUSMA were specifically targeted, resulting in numerous casualties. In May 2012 <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a report saying that Mali was facing its <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mali-facing-human-rights-crisis-amnesty.php">worst human rights crisis</a> [JURIST report] since it gained independence in 1960. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] released a similar report in April 2012 claiming that all sides to the conflict are <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/all-sides-in-mali-conflict-have-committed-war-crimes-hrw.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Also in April 2012 the International Criminal Court (ICC) said they would <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-closely-monitoringsituation-in-mali.php">monitor the situation</a> [JURIST report] in Mali for potential crimes under the ICC's jurisdiction. The turmoil began when Taureg rebels <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/01/20121182151622785.html">attacked Malian soldiers</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Many in the international community <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-rights-expert-concerned-with-ongoing-violence-refugee-safety-in-mali.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the situation, including Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. All of this came after Malian soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/mali-soldiers-take-control-of-government-suspend-constitution.php">took control of the government</a> [JURIST report] and suspended the constitution in March 2012. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-16097439">Alberto Fujimori</a> [BBC Profile; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=+Alberto+Fujimori+">news archive</a>], Peru's former leader who was jailed in 2007, submitted another <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-peru-fujimori-idUSKCN1030US">request for a presidential pardon</a> [Reuters report] on Saturday, just five days before President-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski takes office. Fujimori is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted in 2009 of committing <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/peru-ex-president-fujimori-convicted-of.php">human rights abuses during his 1990-2000 rule</a> [JURIST report]. The Peruvian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/peru-supreme-court-upholds-fujimori.php">upheld the sentence</a> [JURIST report] in January 2010, and Fujimori's previous request for a presidential <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-22823488">pardon was denied</a> [BBC report] in 2013. The request was made in light of Fujimori, who suffers from hypertension, turning 78 years old next week. It is uncertain whether a decision on the request will be made before President-elect Kuczynski takes office. However, Kuczynski is not in favor of pardoning Fujimori's guilt, although he has considered allowing pardons for aging prisoners which would permit the remainder of a sentence to be served through house arrest.</p>

<p>Fujimori is in prison based on four different sentences. In October 2009 Fujimori was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison on <a href="/paperchase/2009/10/peru-ex-president-fujimori-sentenced-to.php">multiple counts of illegal wiretapping and bribery</a> [JURIST report]. In July 2009 Fujimori was <a href="/paperchase/2009/07/peru-ex-president-fujimori-sentenced-to.php">convicted and sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to seven-and-a-half years in prison for paying former Peruvian intelligence director Vladimiro Montesino $15 million to resign in 2000 in the midst of the scandal that ultimately resulted in Fujimori's <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/former-peru-president-arrested-in.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] in 2005. Fujimori's conviction in April 2009 for approving the La Cantuta and Barrios Altos killings was met with <a href="/paperchase/2009/04/dnnp.php">widespread approval</a> [JURIST report] from the current government and human rights organizations. In 2007 Fujimori was <a href="/paperchase/2007/12/peru-court-sentences-fujimori-to-prison.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] of ordering a warrantless search in 2000 on the apartment of Montesino's wife. Prosecutors alleged that the search was intended to uncover and confiscate documents that might incriminate Fujimori. Fujimori, who was president of Peru from 1990 to 2000, was put on trial after being <a href="/paperchase/2007/09/fujimori-extradited-to-peru-after-chile.php">extradited</a> [JURIST report] in 2007 from Chile, where he flew in 2005 as part of a plan to return to Peru and run again for the presidency after years of self-imposed exile in Japan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Representative to Afghanistan Tadamichi Yamamoto <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/statement-un-envoy-tadamichi-yamamoto-condemning-attack-targeting-civilians-attending-peaceful">stated </a> [text] on Sunday that the recent suicide bombings in Kabul amounted to a war crime. On Saturday two suicide bombers <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/24/asia/afghanistan-explosion/">targeted</a> [CNN report] Shiite Hazaras who were holding a peaceful demonstration to push for more access to electricity in the region. Over 260 civilians were reportedly wounded from the attack. Yamamoto denounced the bombings and claimed that any attack targeting a large group of civilians counts as a war crime. While the Taliban has been the cause of recent bombings and kidnappings in Kabul, ISIS immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. As ISIS increases its presence in the region, the Taliban continues to be Kabul's primary security concern. </p>

<p>Civilian casualties continue to be a primary issue in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. In June three Taliban gunmen <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/taliban-gunmen-attack-afghanistan-court-building-killing-prosecutor.php">attacked</a> [JURIST report] a court building in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven people including a newly appointed chief prosecutor. In February UNAMA <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-hit-record-high.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that civilian casualties in Afghanistan had reached a record high 11,000 in 2015. In November the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] and Pentagon officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-hit-record-high.php">completed their investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the October 3 bombing of the <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders </a> (MSF) [advocacy website] hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/631359/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-general-campbell-via-teleconference-fro">announced</a> [statement] that it was an "avoidable accident caused primarily by human error." In October MSF called for an <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/doctors-without-borders-seeks-investigation-into-us-bombing-of-afghan-hospital.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the attack by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission. Also in October the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-kunduz-clinic-airstrikes.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Kunduz hospital attack and for the results of an investigation to be made public. Several days prior to the hospital attack, the UN rights leader also requested that all parties in the Taliban attack in Kunduz <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-afghanistan-attack-to-protect-civilians.php">attempt to keep civilians out of harm</a> [JURIST report]. In August the UN said that a new report shows a significant increase in the number of <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-report-rise-in-women-and-children-casualties-in-afghanistan.php">women and children being hurt or killed</a> [JURIST report] in Afghanistan's war against the Taliban and other insurgents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office">Home Office</a> [official website] announced on Sunday that prosecutors will be encouraged to use tougher sentences against hate crimes in response to the nation's increasingly hostile environment since the EU referendum. Since the middle of June over 6,000 hate crimes and incidents have been <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36875533">reported</a> [BBC report] to the authorities, and the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/">Crown Prosecution Service</a> (CPS) [official website] has also seen a record breaking increase in prosecutions for "violence against the person." The Home Office has denounced recent racially and religiously influenced hostilities, and the department now urges prosecutors to use the law to seek harsher penalties for such crimes. The department hopes that such a change will increase confidence in the CPS. The Home Office also hopes to increase support for recently targeted groups and is making efforts to increase protections for public transport users and Muslim women. The Home Office will dedicate £2.4m to the protection of places of worship. </p>

<p>A majority of British citizens voted to <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">leave</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="http://europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Union</a> (EU) [official website] last month. Concern over the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZB090">economic health of Britain</a> [Reuters report] going into the future led to a global market plunge following the vote, as the pound fell as far as 10 percent against the US dollar&#8212;a low not seen since 1985. While the vote has fallen in favor of departure, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/legal-implications-britain-votes-leave-eu-brexit">no legal changes have taken place yet</a> [Guardian report], as Britain must take further steps to confirm its separation. However, Britain's leading public-interest law firm as well as several experienced litigators are currently <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/uk-lawyers-to-challenge-eu-referendum.php">drafting</a> [JURIST report] a legal challenge to at least trigger a parliamentary debate. Earlier this month, the UK government <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/uk-government-rejects-petition-for-second-eu-referendum-vote.php">rejected a petition</a> [JURIST report] calling for a second referendum vote to prevent the UK from leaving the EU. The EU has set out a mechanism for leaving in <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html">Article 50</a> [text] of the Lisbon Treaty, where a member state "may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements," and "must notify the European council of its intention." Under Article 50, a member country can only be removed from the EU two years after notification. While Britain might bypass this process through repeal of the European Communities Act of 1972, it is believed that this would make coming to a preferential trade agreement with the EU more difficult. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Civilian casualties have reached a <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/afghanistan-record-level-civilian-casualties-sustained-first-half-2016-un-report">record high</a> [press release] in the first half of 2016, with 5,166 civilians recorded killed or maimed, the <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/protection_of_civilians_in_armed_conflict_midyear_report_2016_final.pdf">reported</a> [text, PDF] Monday. More than a third of those have been children, according to the report, and the total number of civilian casualties since 2009 has now climbed to 63,934, including 22,941 deaths and 40,993 injured. Remarking on the latest figures, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said:<blockquote>The violations laid bare in this report set in motion a cascade of potential human rights abuses that stretch from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean and beyond, as so many Afghans are driven to seek refuge abroad, taking enormous risks. ... Parties to the conflict must cease the deliberate targeting of civilians and the use of heavy weaponry in civilian-populated areas. There must be an end to the prevailing impunity enjoyed by those responsible for civilian casualties&#8212;no matter who they are.</blockquote>Among the rights violations documented in the report are the use of children in armed conflict, sexual violence, summary executions and the targeting of journalists and rights defenders. The report calls for justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators.</p>

<p>Civilian casualties continue to be a primary issue in the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. Over the weekend UN Special Representative to Afghanistan Tadamichi Yamamoto said that the recent suicide bombings in Kabul amounted to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-calls-isis-suicide-bombing-in-afghanistan-a-war-crime.php">war crime</a> [JURIST report]. Last month three Taliban gunmen <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/taliban-gunmen-attack-afghanistan-court-building-killing-prosecutor.php">attacked</a> [JURIST report] a court building in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven people including a newly appointed chief prosecutor. In February UNAMA <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-hit-record-high.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that civilian casualties in Afghanistan had reached a record high 11,000 in 2015. In November the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> [official website] and Pentagon officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-hit-record-high.php">completed their investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the October 3 bombing of the <a href="http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a> (MSF) [advocacy website] hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, and <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/631359/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-general-campbell-via-teleconference-fro">announced</a> [statement] that it was an "avoidable accident caused primarily by human error." In October MSF called for an <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/doctors-without-borders-seeks-investigation-into-us-bombing-of-afghan-hospital.php">independent investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the attack by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission. Also in October Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-chief-calls-for-investigation-into-kunduz-clinic-airstrikes.php">called for an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Kunduz hospital attack and for the results of an investigation to be made public. Several days prior to the hospital attack, the UN rights leader also requested that all parties in the Taliban attack in Kunduz <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-rights-chief-urges-parties-in-afghanistan-attack-to-protect-civilians.php">attempt to keep civilians out of harm</a> [JURIST report]. In August the UN said that a new report shows a significant increase in the number of <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-report-rise-in-women-and-children-casualties-in-afghanistan.php">women and children being hurt or killed</a> [JURIST report] in Afghanistan's war against the Taliban and other insurgents.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/">Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2016-07-25/strengthening-counter-terrorism-legislation">proposed new counter-terrorism legislation</a> [press release] that would allow for indefinite detention. Turnbull announced plans to introduce Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016, which would allow for the indefinite detention of convicted terrorists who have served their sentences but are still deemed a threat to public safety. According to Turnbull, this would be, "supervised by the courts similarly to the arrangements that apply in a number of our jurisdictions for sex offenders and extremely violent individuals." The legislation would also allow for "control orders" to be placed on individuals as young as 14 years of age and would add a new offense of advocating genocide. Turnbull <a href="https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2016-07-25/joint-press-conference">said</a> [transcript]:<blockquote>Together the measures that we are announcing today are designed to deter terrorism, prevent it, ensure that the nation and our people are kept safe and to provide reassurance that Australians can and should continue going about their daily lives and enjoying their freedom in the usual way because they should understand and recognise that the Australian Government and its agencies are doing everything possible to keep them safe.</blockquote>Turnbull said he has asked Attorney General George Brandis to meet with his local counterparts "as soon as practicable to ensure that post-sentence preventative detention legislation can be introduced quickly."</p>

<p>Turnbull referenced recent attacks in Nice, France, and Orlando, Florida, stating that the Islamic State "continues to inspire and direct atrocities across the world." Other countries have also proposed stricter anti-terror legislation in the wake of recent attacks. Last month Russia's lower house of parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/russia-approves-anti-terrorism-amendments.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a number of counter-terrorism amendments, banning proselytizing, preaching and praying outside officially recognized religious institutions. They also criminalize failure to report certain types of crimes and force cellular and internet providers to store all communications data for six months and to help security services decipher all messaging applications. In May Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that he does <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/turkish-president-refuses-to-change-anti-terrorism-law-despite-eu-deal.php">not plan to change</a> [JURIST report] the country's anti-terrorism law, a requirement of a deal struck between Turkey and EU in March. In December China <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/china-passes-controversial-anti-terrorism-law.php">passed a new anti-terrorism law</a> [JURIST report] requiring technology companies to provide information to the government obtained from their products and make information systems "secure and controllable."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amnesty International (AI) on Monday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/turkey-arrest-warrants-for-42-journalists-a-brazen-attack-on-press-freedom/">condemned</a> [press release] Turkey's decision to issue arrest warrants for 42 journalists following the recent coup attempt. AI's Deputy Director for Europe, Gauri van Gulik, claimed that "by rounding up journalists" the government "is failing to make a distinction between criminal acts and legitimate criticism". AI's latest condemnations come a day after it <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/07/turkey-independent-monitors-must-be-allowed-to-access-detainees-amid-torture-allegations/">announced</a> [press release] that it had gathered "credible evidence" that detainees are being subjected to torture in "official and unofficial detention centres in the country." According to the human rights organization, there are credible reports that detainees are being forced to maintain "stress positions" for up to 48 hours and are being denied food, water and medical treatment and are being subjected to severe beatings, rape and other torture. More than 10,000 people have been detained since the attempted coup, and AI's Deputy Director for Europe called on Turkey to allow for freedom of the press and end the most recent clampdown on human rights following the failed coup.</p>

<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has vowed that those involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">coup</a> [JURIST report] will "pay a heavy price." Last week Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkey-closes-thousands-of-private-schools-charities-and-other-institutions.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the closure of thousands of private schools, charities and other institutions. Also last week Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that he would approve reinstating the death penalty so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kuwait's supreme court upheld the acquittal of Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Sabah on Monday on charges of insulting the public prosecutor and inciting public unrest. Sheikh Ahmad is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/sports/olympics/kuwaiti-sheiks-influence-in-olympic-world-grows.html?_r=0">powerful member</a> [NYT report] of various international sports organizations, and the <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/1044237/kuwait-top-court-acquits-ioc-powerbroker-sheikh-ahmad">acquittal</a> [AFP report] comes at a time when the Kuwaiti Olympic Committee is serving a suspension that could impede Kuwaiti athletes from flying their own flag at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Sheikh Ahmad is a member of the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=kuw/committee-members.html">Fédération Internationale de Football Association</a> (FIFA) executive committee, <a href="https://www.olympic.org/sheikh-ahmad-al-fahad-al-sabah">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) and the <a href="http://www.ocasia.org/council/members.aspx?WPT6r4rMEFY=">Olympic Council of Asia</a> [profiles]. The Kuwaiti government has an <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/afp/2016/07/fbl-kuw-fifa-politics-kuwait-royal-court.html">ongoing</a> [<em>Al Monitor</em> report] lawsuit against Sheikh Ahmad over the Olympic suspensions and the acquitted case against him began when the suspensions were put in place in October.</p>

<p>Last month, the government of Kuwait <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/kuwait-sues-olympic-organization.php">filed</a> [JURIST] a lawsuit in Swiss court against the IOC seeking $1 billion in damages for its suspension of the KOC. Kuwait has been suspended from the Olympics twice in the last five years. Kuwait was suspended from the Olympics in 2015 and if the ban remains in place for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Kuwaiti athletes will be able to compete, but under the Olympic rather than the Kuwaiti flag. The IOC insisted that the government of Kuwait change Kuwaiti sports law to lift the ban. The Kuwaiti government has maintained that it cannot change its laws without its Parliament as a democratic country with due process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thai military officials on Tuesday charged three human rights defenders with criminal defamation and violations of the Computer Crimes Act because of a report they published detailing acts of torture in Thailand. The defenders, Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, Anchana Heemmina and Somchai Homlaor, <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/security/1045074/rights-activists- charged-over- report-on-army- torture">face up to five years</a> [AFP report] in jail time if convicted. The report, Torture and ill treatment in The Deep South Documented in 2014-2015, details 54 incidents of torture and human rights abuses in South Thailand, and the activists hoped that it would cast a light on an issue so often glossed over due to marginalization and would <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/thai-activists- charged-report- army-torture-160726171815097.html">encourage victims</a> [Al Jazeera report] to share their experiences. Several rights groups have come out against the arrests in a <a href="http://protectioninternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Joint- Statement-on- Reprisals-Against-Ms-Pornpen- Ms-Anchana- and-Mr- Somchai-Final- with-Endorsements- English-13- June-2016- 1.pdf">joint report</a> [text, PDF], calling them a "reprisal against civil society groups seeking to bring to the authorities' attention the continued abuse of power and ill-treatment of detainees in Thailand." The report urged the government to drop all charges against the rights defenders and ensure that retaliation is not allowed, as well as general human rights recommendations going forward. </p>

<p>Human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand since the military junta came to power in May 2014. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-thailand- should-stop- retaliating-against- human-rights-lawyers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to stop harassing and charging human right lawyers for defending victims of the government's abuses. Also in March the Pheu Thai Party <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/thailand-government-accused-of-human-rights-violations.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights over the detention of one of its key figures, Watana Muangsook, accusing the government of serious human rights violations. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called on the Thai government to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-thailand-must-fully-investigate-forced-disappearances.php">fully investigate</a> [JURIST report] the whereabouts of at least 82 people listed as disappeared and criminalize forced disappearance through legislation. That same month, Thailand unveiled a new <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/thailands-draft-constitution-unveiled.php">draft constitution</a> [JURIST report], which human rights groups stated was aimed at increasing the power of the military under the guise of clauses intended to promote national security permitting them to commit human rights abuses without fear of punishment in violation of international treaties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] on Tuesday gave <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/filelibrary/2800/Order-Granting-Preliminary-Approval.pdf">preliminary approval</a> [order, PDF] to a $15 billion <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/crb/vwmdl">settlement</a> [case materials] between German automaker <a href="http://www.volkswagenag.com/homepage">Volkswagen AG</a> (VW) [corporate website] and the US <a href="https://www3.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website], California officials and consumers. Judge Charles Breyer's ruling allows attorneys to begin gathering information from nearly 500,000 consumers whose diesel-powered vehicles were found to have violated US emissions standards. Under the terms of the agreement, owners will be able to choose between having Volkswagen buy back or fix the vehicles. Final approval for the settlement could come at a hearing on October 18.</p>

<p>VW is facing legal difficulty around the world over the emissions scandal. A law firm in Germany <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/volkswagen-facing-multi-billion-dollar-investor-lawsuit-in-germany.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in March on behalf of investors alleging a breach of duty to the capital market. Last year the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office opened a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/germany-prosecutor-investigating-former-vw-ceo.php">criminal investigation</a> [JURIST report] of former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn, following accusations that the company cheated on government emissions tests by manipulating exhaust valves. The investigation followed several criminal complaints, including one filed by VW, and came less than a week after Winterkorn stepped down as CEO of the company. In his statement he accepted "responsibility for the irregularities that have been found in diesel engines" and said that he was "clearing the way for this fresh start with [his] resignation."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers for a transgender Virginia teenager on Tuesday <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/no._16a52_response_by_gg_to_gloucester_county_school_board_application.pdf">urged</a> [response, PDF] the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] not to block a ruling allowing him to use the boys' restroom. The <a href="http://gets.gc.k12.va.us/#">Gloucester County School Board</a> [official website] had <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/virginia-school-board-asks-supreme-court-to-block-order-in-transgender-bathroom-case.php">filed an emergency application</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month asking the court to halt the application of both an <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/069_order_granting_plaintiff_g.g.s_motion_for_preliminary_injunction_2016.06.23.pdf">order</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a> [official website] and a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/074_decision_2016.04.19_0.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] by the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit </a> [official website], which mandate that the student be allowed to use the restroom that aligns with his gender identity. The school board is concerned that if the mandate were to take effect it would disrupt the upcoming school year, but lawyers for the student argued that the school board has &#8220;utterly failed&#8221; to show that it would suffer lasting harm.</p>

<p>Gavin Grimm, a high school student at a Gloucester County school who identifies as male, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-orders-school-board-to-allow-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">granted an order</a> [JURIST report] by the district court in June allowing him to use the boys' restroom while the court considers the legal issues of the case. This order came after a decision by the federal court in April, which reversed a lower court decision in holding Grimm's rights under <a href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm">Title IX</a> [official website], which prohibits discrimination in schools, were violated by the school board refusing his use of the men's restroom. It was at that time the Gloucester County School Board first stated its intention to ask the US Supreme Court to review the Fourth Circuit decision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Baltimore City <a href="http://www.stattorney.org/office/meet-marilyn-mosby">State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby</a> [official profile] announced Wednesday that charges against the three remaining officers facing trial in connection with Freddie Gray's death will be <a href="http://www.stattorney.org/media-center/press-releases/1035-mosby-breaks-silence-defending-her-pursuit-of-justice-for-freddie-gray">dropped</a> [press release]. While in police custody in 2015, Gray sustained a spinal cord injury, which ultimately resulted his death. Three officers were previously acquitted in the case. Mosby <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-baltimore-police-idUSKCN1071S4">proclaimed</a> [Reuters report] that this case showed "an inherent bias that is a direct result of when police police themselves."</p>

<p>Mosby <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-indicted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in the indictment of the police officers on charges including murder and manslaughter May 2015. Gray's arrest and death in April of last year led to widespread protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. In September Baltimore reached a tentative agreement with Gray's family to pay $6.4 million in <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/baltimore-reaches-tentative-64-million-settlement-in-freddie-gray-case.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report]. In April of last year Amnesty International urged Baltimore police to exercise <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/judges-opinion-in-hinckley-case/2102/">ordered</a> [opinion] Ronald Reagan shooter John Hinckley Jr. released from a government psychiatric hospital. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1981 and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where he has remained for 35 years. The release places restrictions on Hinckley, although he will be allowed to live on his own in a year. Hinckley is required to attend individual and group therapy sessions and is barred from talking to the media. There are also restrictions on how far he can travel. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation disagrees with the ruling and argues Hinckley is still a threat to others in the community. </p>

<p>Hinckley has lived at <a href="https://www.semc.org">St. Elizabeth's Medical Center</a> [hospital website] in Washington since he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of Reagan, press secretary James Brady and two law enforcement officers. Over the last 12 years, Hinckley has gradually been granted more and more freedom to spend time at his <a href="/paperchase/2005/12/judge-allows-hinckley-overnight-visits.php">mother's home</a> [JURIST report] rather than in the hospital. According to Hinckley's treatment providers, he has not shown any signs of psychotic symptoms, delusional thinking or any violent tendencies. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Wednesday urged Indonesia to halt the imminent executions of 14 individuals, convicted mainly for drug-related offenses. The executions are set to take place as early as Friday on Nusa Kambangan island in central Java. Zeid called for an immediate moratorium on the death penalty, expressing grave concern over Indonesia's use of the practice:<blockquote>The increasing use of the death penalty in Indonesia is terribly worrying, and I urge the Government to immediately end this practice which is unjust and incompatible with human rights. ... I find it deeply disturbing that Indonesia has already executed 19 people since 2013, making it the most prolific executioner in South-East Asia. ... The death penalty is not an effective deterrent relative to other forms of punishment nor does it protect people from drug abuse. The focus of drug-related crime prevention should involve strengthening the justice system and making it more effective.</blockquote>Zeid called on the government to work with his office to devise alternate strategies to combat drug-related crime.</p>

<p>Indonesian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15105920">President Joko Widodo</a> [BBC profile] has remained firm in his stance that drug smugglers must face harsh penalties despite international criticism. Last year a spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. Also last year Brazil and the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/execution-of-drug-traffickers-sparks-international-condemnation.php">recalled</a> their ambassadors from Indonesia after an Indonesian firing squad <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/six-drug-smugglers-executed-in-indonesia.php">executed six convicted drug traffickers</a> [JURIST report], sparking international condemnation from human rights groups and foreign leaders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> (EC) [official website] <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2643_en.htm">called upon Poland</a> [press release] Wednesday to guarantee political freedom to its top court, saying the rule of law in the country is under "systematic threat." Poland's highest court, the Constitutional Tribunal, has faced rapid changes and international criticism over the past year as the ruling <a href="http://pis.org.pl">Law and Justice Party</a> (PiS) [party website, in Polish] has come into power and fired judges and suppressed judgments. PiS is a conservative party, and EU officials have issued warnings concerning their handling of the Constitutional Tribunal. Frans Timmermans, First Vice-President of the European Commission, stated that "the Commission considers the main issues which threaten the rule of law in Poland that have not been resolved." He went on to explain that though <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/poland-lawmakers-approve-constitutional-court-reforms.php">Poland passed legislation unblocking the court</a> [JURIST report], such measures are not sufficient, and EC has made concrete recommendations to Poland on how to address and rectify the issues with the Constitutional Court so that the body may resume its proper judicial functions. </p>

<p>The international <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/events/?lang=EN">Venice Commission</a>, a branch of the <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/home">Council of Europe</a> [official websites], began an <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/events/?id=2170">investigation</a> [press release] into Poland's recent changes to its Constitutional Court this past February. The <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">EU is examining the decision</a> regarding the Constitutional Court as well as <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/poland-president-signs-bill-giving-government-control-of-media.php">new media laws passed in January</a> [JURIST reports]. Earlier this year the Polish government passed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">controversial surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">grants the government</a>[press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. The PiS, a conservative party elected in October, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34648575">holds an overwhelming majority</a> [BBC report] of positions in the Polish government including the lead in both parliamentary houses and the presidency. Last December the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">PiS' rise to power in Poland to a coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">PiS has rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland. However, there is a larger concern in the EU that new Polish law will erode checks and balances on government powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian and Syrian forces are using cluster bombs to target civilians and rebels in the northern portions of Syria, <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/28/russia/syria-widespread-new-cluster-munition-use">reported</a> [press release] Thursday. More than 46 attacks related to cluster munition have been documented since May, and it is estimated that dozens were injured or killed by their usage. HRW has long decried the use of cluster munitions and has helped form the <a href="http://www.stopclustermunitions.org/en-gb/home.aspx">Cluster Munition Coalition</a> [official website] in attempts to ban their use. Cluster Munitions in warfare are particularly dangerous to civilians due to their unpredictable nature and the manner in which undetonated portions of the cluster may remain hidden in the ground as de facto land mines.</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war based around the legitimacy of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC reports]. Last month UN human rights experts called for the immediate <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians. In May <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that armed opposition groups in Syria are committing war crimes around the Sheikh Maqsoud district of Aleppo city. Earlier that month top UN official Stephen O'Brien called for the immediate investigation of recent airstrikes in Syria, which may amount to war crimes for <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-official-syria-airstrikes-may-amount-to-war-crime.php"> intentionally targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.are.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas</a> [official website] <a href="https://doc-10-5o-docs.googleusercontent.com/docs/securesc/ha0ro937gcuc7l7deffksulhg5h7mbp1/7oo5qhkl0hbgmd9e5ubm1id0vd6nkc6e/1469793600000/03046479840133227239/*/0B86_q26R1KupNHYzalplWWhSenc?e=download">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that an Arkansas law prohibiting political "robocalls" is unconstitutional. The judge stated that the <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-5/subtitle-6/chapter-63/subchapter-2/5-63-204">law</a> [materials] violates the First Amendment right to free speech, in particular political speech. The judge explained that as the law was a content-based restriction, strict scrutiny must be applied to determine its constitutionality. Strict scrutiny requires a law further a compelling interest and be necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The <a href="http://www.arkansasag.gov/">Arkansas Attorney General</a> [official website] identified three interests advanced by the legislation: first, protecting citizens from "unwanted, intrusive speech" in the home; second, the protecting citizens from "repeated, unwanted intrusions;" and third, "preventing seizure of phone lines, which could interfere with emergency calls being placed or received." While the judge acknowledged the importance of these goals, he pointed to prior precedent in labeling these interests "substantial but not compelling." The judge was also unconvinced the law was sufficiently narrowly tailored. The court enjoined the Attorney General from enforcing this portion of the law, but did not enjoin other portions of the law restricting robocalls in regards to offering goods or services and gathering of data.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was <a href="http://www.arkansasmatters.com/news/local-news/judge-rules-ark-ban-on-political-robocalls-unconstitutional">brought</a> [Arkansasmatters report] on behalf of Conquest Communications and Conquest political consultant and manager Victor Gresham against the Arkansas Attorney General, Leslie Rutledge. Gresham and Conquest wish to utilize political robocalls to assist Arkansas politicians through "surveys, messages concerning voting, advocacy calls," among other services. Following the ruling, Rutledge stated she would review the ruling and take action accordingly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] said Thursday that Chelsea Manning is being <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/chelsea-manning-faces-new-charges-indefinite-solitary-confinement-related-suicide-attempt">investigated</a> [press release] for charges in relation to her recent attempt at suicide. Manning, the Army solider convicted of releasing classified and sensitive military and diplomatic documents to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> [advocacy website], is currently facing a 35-year sentence and, if convicted of the "administrative offenses," could face the rest of those 35 years in solitary confinement. These <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/transcribedchelseachargesheet.pdf">"administrative offenses"</a> [charge sheet, PDF] consist of "resisting the force cell move team," "prohibited property," and "conduct which threatens." ACLU Staff Attorney Chase Strangio issued a statement in which he was deeply critical of the Army's handling of Manning, in particular the "denial of medical care related to her gender transition" despite "the treatment [being] recognized as necessary." Strangio went on to say that "while Chelsea is suffering the darkest depression she has experienced since her arrest, the government is taking actions to punish her for that pain." The report goes on to say that the Army continues to deny necessary medical care to Chelsea, including medical treatment following her suicide attempt.</p>

<p><a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">Manning's trial</a>  [JURIST op-ed] has garnered much debate. This May Manning <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/chelsea-manning-appeals-35-year-sentence.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her 35-year prison sentence. In 2013 Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">filed for a presidential pardon</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35-year sentence</a> [JURIST reports]. The sentence came a month after she was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act, but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." The judge had <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] in order to require the government to prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against her for providing classified materials to Wikileaks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jin Kyung-joon, a senior prosecutor in South Korea, was indicted on charges of bribery Friday. Jin has been <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korea-indicts-senior-prosecutor-on-corruption-charges-1469780412">accused</a> [WSJ report] of accepting more than USD $11 million from an executive at the online-game company <a href="http://company.nexon.co.jp/en/">Nexon</a> [corporate website] during collusive stock transactions over a nine-year period.  Jin is the highest ranking official in recent history to face a corruption scandal. He is a vice-ministerial level official. </p>

<p>Jin's <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/south-korea-prosector-arrested-for-corruption.php">arrest</a> [JURIST report] follows recent news of corruption investigations taking place worldwide. Earlier this month a federal judge in Buenos Aires <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ex-argentina-presidents-assets-frozen.php">froze</a> [JURIST report] the assets of former Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner who was charged with conspiring to sell USD $17 billion in futures contracts using an inflated dollar value for the country's own currency. Also this month a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-jails-former-presidents-top-aide-on-bribery-charges.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] a former president's top aide to life in prison after finding him guilty of taking bribes, illegally obtaining state secrets and abuse of power. Last month the Supreme Court of the Maldives <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/maldives-supreme-court-upholds-prison-sentence-of-former-president.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the 13-year prison sentence of former president Mohamed Nasheed on terrorism-related charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Following released <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2016/07/25/4504895.htm">footage</a> [ABC report] showing indigenous children being abused while in detention in Australia's Northern Territory, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called upon the Australian government Thursday to alter its current juvenile detention policies. Among the abuses are use of tear gas, hooding the children and strapping them to restraint chairs, all of which AI Senior Research Adviser for South East Asia and the Pacific, Champa Patel, called "shocking violation[s] of both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture." AI has called upon Australia to ratify the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/OPCAT.aspx">UN Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture</a> (OPCAT) [materials], which would allow for extensive, independent supervision of the country's detention facilities through a National Preventative Mechanism (NPM). The news report goes on to compare the indigenous children detention facility conditions to those of Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib with the children facing verbal abuse, little access to water and natural light, and denial of access to education.</p>

<p>This most recent video will bring further international scrutiny to Australia's handling of detainees and prisoners. In May the Papua New Guinea officials stated Australian refugees are <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/papua-new-guinea-announces-end-of-detainment-of-manus-island-asylum-seekers.php">not being detained</a> [JURIST report], as they are given access to mainland Australia, although refugee advocates believe that the refugees are being faced with arbitrary restrictions to the mainland. The statement by officials followed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/papua-new-guinea-top-court-rules-australia-offshore-detention-facility-illegal.php">ruling</a> by the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court that the Australian off-shore detention facility was illegal, in direct opposition to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/australia-high-court-rules-offshore-detention-policy-legal.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] by the Australian Supreme Court earlier this year that the off-shore detention was legal. In February the UN Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-experts-find-australia-violated-rights-of-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] in which it stated Australia had violated the rights of Guantanamo detainee David Hicks, continuing to detain him after his transfer from the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indonesia implemented a firing squad to execute four individuals convicted of drug charges Friday, despite international outcry for the nation to cease the use of the death penalty in drug crimes. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/world/asia/indonesia-executions-drug-crimes.html">four individuals</a> [NYT report] comprised two Nigerians, one Senegalese and one Indonesian. As many as 10 other people may await the same fate, many of whom are foreign to the nation. It is still unclear how many prisoners have been transferred to Nusa Kambangan, the island on which Indonesia carries out executions. </p>

<p>Indonesian President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15105920">Joko Widodo</a> [BBC profile] has remained firm in his stance that drug smugglers must face harsh penalties despite international criticism. Earlier this week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-rights-chief-urges-indonesia-to-halt-planned-executions.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Indonesia to halt the imminent executions of 14 individuals, convicted mainly for drug-related offenses.  Last year a spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. Also last year Brazil and the Netherlands <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/execution-of-drug-traffickers-sparks-international-condemnation.php">recalled</a> their ambassadors from Indonesia after an Indonesian firing squad <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/six-drug-smugglers-executed-in-indonesia.php">executed six convicted drug traffickers </a>[JURIST report], sparking international condemnation from human rights groups and foreign leaders.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/07/29/flint-water-charges/87699876/">Detroit News</a> [news report] reported Friday that six state employees have been criminally indicted in relation to the Flint water crisis. <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/ag/">Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette</a> [official website] filed the criminal charges against three employees of the <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/">Department of Health and Human Services</a> (DHHS) [official website] and three <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/DEQ">Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) [official website] employees. The DHSS employees indicted were Nancy Peeler, Robert Scott and Corrine MIller, and the charges include "misconduct in office, conspiring to commit misconduct in office and willful neglect of duty relating to allegedly concealing or disregarding test results showing high levels of lead in the bloodstreams of Flint residents." The DEQ employees indicted were former chief of Michigan's Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance, Shekter Smith, and water regulators Patrick Cook and Adam Rosenthal. All three face various charges, including misconduct in office and willful neglect of duty, for their various roles in misleading environmental officials and denying and refusing to address the heightened levels of lead in Flint's drinking water.</p>

<p>Numerous lawsuits have been filed in response to the Flint water contamination crisis. In May the <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/naacp-sues-michigan-officials-over-flint-water-contamination.php">brought a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against against Michigan officials for their action and inaction in Flint. A month prior a group of Flint residents <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/flint-residents-sue-epa-over-lead-contaminated-water.php">filed an administrative complaint</a> [JURIST report] against the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/05/www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] for negligence in handling the Flint water crisis.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former president of Brazil <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-10841416">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> [BBC profile] filed a petition with the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIndex.aspx">UN Human Rights Committee</a> [official website] Thursday, claiming his corruption investigation has been riddled with impartiality and abuse of power by the judge. The <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-former-president-asks-u-n-to-intervene-in-case-1469753079">petition</a> [WSJ report], signed by da Silva's lawyers and British human rights lawyer Georffrey Robertson, alleges that Judge Sergio Moro has violated the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> [materials], denying da Silva the right to a fair trial, freedom from arbitrary detention, and right to privacy. The former president alleges two instances of violation of his rights. First, he claims Moro allowed federal police to compel him to give deposition despite his having cooperated previously, and with no indication he would not further cooperate. This eventually led to da Sliva's detention for "security reasons." Second, following his appointment as chief of staff for his successor, Dilma Rousseff, Moro released a recording of da Silva speaking with his family, lawyers and other politicians, including Rousseff. Following the release of this recording, da Silva's nomination was suspended and soon after Rousseff was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-president-suspended-following-senate-vote-for-impeachment-trial.php">suspended and put on trial</a> [JURIST report] for impeachment. The former president was indicted on corruption charges stemming from his involvement with state-owned oil company Petrobas. He was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/former-brazil-president-subpoenaed-in-connection-to-money-laundering-scheme.php">subpoenaed</a> [JURIST report] in January.</p>

<p>More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal, including the chief of staff under Brazil's former President Jose Dirceu and the former president <a href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Fernando-Collor-de-Mello">Fernando Collor de Mellon</a> [Britannica profile]. In November Brazil's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/brazil-arrests-politician-and-investment-banker-in-corruption-investigation.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the arrest of André Esteves, the chief executive of the country's largest investment bank, and that of Delcídio do Amaral, a powerful senator of the country's ruling party, both accused of bribery and corruption affiliated with Petrobras.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/153459p.pdf">refused to dismiss</a> [opinion, PDF] bribery and fraud charges levied against US Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. Menendez, who is believed to have accepted gifts in exchange for political influence, claims his meetings with government officials were to discuss policy and not for the purpose of garnering gifts and monetary contributions. In denying Menendez's motion for dismissal, the court stated "the acts alleged in this case were essentially lobbying on behalf of a particular party and thus, under specific circumstances here, are outside of constitutional harbor," granted by the Speech or Debate clause, which protects legislators from legal redress for legitimate legislative activities.</p>

<p>Menendez was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senator-bob-menendez-pleads-guilty-corruption-charges/story?id=30068885">charged</a> [ABC report] with 14 counts of bribery in April, after a three-year investigation by the Justice Department. The senator's indictment alleges that he accepted approximately $1 million in gifts and campaign contributions from his friend, Dr. Salomon Melgen, in exchange for using his political power to benefit the doctor. Among the various favors Menendez performed are pulling strings in a lawsuit against Melgen for $8.9 million of Medicare overbilling and helping Melgen's girlfriends obtain their visas.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Three former Irish bankers were sentenced to prison on Friday for conspiring to defraud customers and investors during the 2008 banking crisis. In what was Ireland's longest criminal trial ever (74 days), former CEO of Irish Life and Permanent plc, Denis Casey, and two former executives of Anglo Irish Bank Corp., John Bowe and Willie McAteer, were <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-29/former-senior-irish-bankers-sent-to-prison-after-longest-trial">convicted</a> [Bloomberg report] for their role in collapsing a bank during the financial crisis. According to the court, the three had created a false impression of Anglo Irish Bank's financial security through <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ireland-banking-court-idUSKCN10912E?il=0">creating a 7.2-billion-euro circular payment</a> [Reuters report]. Anglo Irish was liquidated in 2013, the last year of a sovereign bailout starting in 2010. Casey was sentenced to two years and nine months, Bowe was sentenced to two years, and McAteer was sentenced to three years and six months.</p>

<p>Anglo Irish has been the center of controversy, its collapse thought to have been the main driving force behind the Irish banking crisis. In March two former Anglo Irish executives, Tiarnan O'Mahoney and Bernard Daly,had their convictions for furnishing false information and conspiring to defraud <a href="http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/two-anglo-execs-to-walk-free-as-court-quashes-conviction-725307.html">quashed</a> [BN report] by the <a href="http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/PageCurrent/8189B0D4120A08BE80257FBC004C7D35?opendocument&l=en">Court of Appeal</a> [official website]. In October Anglo Irish's former CEO David Drumm was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/11/banker-david-drumm-former-anglo-irish-boss-held-in-us-custody-and-faces-extradition">arrested</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] in Massachusetts on an extradition warrant alleging forgery, conspiracy to defraud, and false accounting. Drumm had moved to Boston two years after the economic crash in Ireland and attempted to declare bankruptcy, owing more than $11 million in loans he had borrowed from the bank. His application for bankruptcy was denied and was accused of lying and acting fraudulently in declaring bankruptcy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/7-29-16%204th%20Circuit%20NAACP%20v%20NC.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] several provisions of <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v9.pdf">North Carolina's House Bill 589 (HB 589)</a> [text, PDF], most notably its voter identification requirements. In its decision to annul the voter ID provision of the statute, as well as provisions eliminating early voting, pre-registration same-day registration, and out-of-precinct voting, the court stated that the legislation was "passed with racially discriminatory intent." The panel further explained that it, unlike the lower district court, was unconvinced by the argument that the statute's enactment was "the innocuous back-and-forth of routine partisan struggle." Instead the panel suggested that the Republic-controlled state-legislature was motivated to enact HB 589 after an "unprecedented African American voter participation in a state with troubled racial history and racially polarized voting." While the decision was unanimous, one justice disagreed with the decision to permanently enjoin the voter identification provision, expressing belief that the "reasonable impediment" exception provided ample protection against any potential discrimination. The decision overturns a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-upholds-voter-id-law.php">district court decision</a> [JURIST report] upholding HB 589 in April.</p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Last month a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Earlier in May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter identification law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to provide <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">bill that will allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/319668455/Samsung-v-Apple-briefing-July-29-2016#from_embed">brief</a> [text] filed on Friday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] asked the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] to rule against <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> [corporate website] in its patent infringement lawsuit. Apple contended in its brief that Samsung has been <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-samsung-elec-lawsuit-idUSKCN1091Z0">unable to provide sufficient evidence</a> [Reuters report] that design patent damages should be decided based on the value of the individual component, as opposed to the entire device. Apple won its patent dispute with Samsung in 2012, where Apple was to receive $930 million from Samsung. A federal court of appeals would later reverse damages on trademark liability charge, and so reduced Apple's award to $548 million, $399 million of which is based upon design patents. While Samsung has already paid Apple the $548 million in damages, Samsung has reserved the right to recover a portion of those damages, if the Supreme Court chooses to rule against Apple, holding patent damages to only pertain to the individual component. The decision is highly anticipated and several groups and corporations have filed amicus curiae briefs, including the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a>, the <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/">Computer and Communications Industry Association</a> and <a href="http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/?ref=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">Nike</a> [websites].</p>

<p>This is the most recent installment of the <a href="/dateline/2012/10/major-moore-apple-samsung.php#.U2TvNa1dXG4">ongoing patent dispute</a> [JURIST op-ed] between the two electronics giants. In March the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-to-hear-samsung-appeal-against-apple.php">agreed to hear</a> [JURIST report] Samsung's current appeal. In February the <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/15-1171.Opinion.2-24-2016.1.PDF">overturned</a> [opinion, PDF] a 2014 <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/lhk/applevsamsung">verdict</a> [materials] against Samsung in its patent infringement conflict with Apple. In January the <a href="http://cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/california-district-court-grants-apple-permanent-injunction-against-samsung.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] Apple's motion for a permanent injunction against Samsung for infringing upon three software patents. In August 2014 the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-denies-apple-request-for-ban-on-samsung-phones-and-tablets.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] Apple's request to ban Samsung from selling any of its products that infringed on Apple's patented technology. Earlier in August 2014 Apple and Samsung <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/apple-samsung-agree-to-dismiss-international-patent-disputes.php">agreed to drop</a> [JURIST report] all patent infringement lawsuits in courts outside of the US. In June 2014 Apple and Samsung also <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/apple-samsung-drop-cross-appeal-in-itc-phone-patent-dispute.php">agreed to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] their appeals of a patent infringement case at the US <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/">International Trade Commission</a> [official website] that resulted in an import ban on some older model Samsung phones.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian judge announced Friday that former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will stand trial for obstruction of justice. Federal court judge Ricardo Leite in Brasília <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/former-brazilian-president-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-to-stand-trial-1438096">concluded</a> [NDTV report] that there is sufficient evidence to charge the former president and six other individuals. Da Silva is alleged to have conspired to "buy the silence of a former Petrobras director" who was arrested in connection with the ongoing investigation into corruption at the "state-run" oil company. The other individuals that will be tried for their involvement are former senator Delcídio do Amaral, Diogo Ferreira, André Esteves, Edson Ribeiro, José Carloes Bumlai and Maurício Bumlai. Amaral <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/world/americas/brazil-lula-petrobras.html?_r=0">alleges</a> [NYT report] that he and the former president arranged to have the legal fees paid for the arrested former Petrobras director in exchange for his silence. Da Silva has denied the charges.</p>

<p>More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal that continues to plague the country as it prepares for the upcoming summer Olympics. This week da Silva <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-appeals-to-un-for-rights-violation-in-corruption-investigation-1.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a petition with the UN Human Rights Committee, claiming that his corruption investigation has been riddled with impartiality and abuse of power by the judge. In May Brazil's Supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-house-speaker-suspended-for-obstructing-corruption-investigation.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha after being suspected of obstructing investigations into his allegedly corrupt activities. Also in May, local media in Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-call-for-investigation-of-president.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the country's top prosecutors had requested an investigation into sitting-President Dilma Rousseff over alleged connections to the Petrobras corruption scandal. In April, The Supreme Federal Court in Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the legislature to commence impeachment proceedings against Vice President Michel Temer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/opinions/pdfs/15-cv-324,%20One%20Wisconsin%20July%2029.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] several Wisconsin election laws, passed in recent years, stating that "parts of Wisconsin's election regime fail to comply with the constitutional requirement that its elections remain fair and equally open to all qualified electors." In making that determination, Judge James Peterson stated:<blockquote>The heart of the opinion considers whether each of the other challenged provisions unduly burdens the right to vote, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This analysis proceeds under what is known as the Anderson-Burdick framework, which sets out a three-step analysis. First, I determine the extent of the burden imposed by the challenged provision. Second, I evaluate the interest that the state offers to justify that burden. Third, I judge whether the interest justifies the burden.</blockquote>Performing the analysis above, the court rejected the plaintiffs' facial challenge to the entire set of voter ID laws in order to comply with the US Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit precedents, but specifically struck down: 1) most of the state-imposed limitations on the time and location for in-person absentee voting (although the state may set a uniform rule disallowing in-person absentee voting on the Monday before elections); 2) the requirement that "dorm lists" to be used as proof of residence include citizenship information; 3) the 28-day durational residency requirement; 4) the prohibition on distributing absentee ballots by fax or email; and 5) the bar on using expired but otherwise qualifying student IDs. Granting the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the stricken-down laws, the court ordered the state to "Promptly issue a credential valid as a voting ID to any person who enters the [ID Petition Process] or who has a petition pending." The <a href="https://www.doj.state.wi.us/">Wisconsin State Department of Justice</a> [official website], which defended the laws, has expressed its <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/federal-judge-strikes-wisconsin-election-laws-41004749">intention to appeal</a> [ABC News report] the ruling. </p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Also Friday a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-portions-of-north-carolina-voting-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v9.pdf">North Carolina's House Bill 589</a> (HB 589) [text, PDF], most notably its voter identification requirements. Last month a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Earlier in May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter identification law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">is constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">provide proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">a bill that will allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A county judge <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/court-orders-immediate-halt-kansas-dual-voter-registration-system">ruled</a> [ACLU press release] Friday that Kansas must count thousands of votes from people who registered without providing citizenship documents. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach had <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-07-29/kansas-judge-to-rule-soon-on-voting-restriction">imposed</a> [AP report] a rule that directed local election officials to not count votes for state and local offices from people who registered to vote at a state motor vehicle office without providing proof of their US citizenship. The rule would have allowed election officials to count the votes from this demographic for federal offices. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/brown-v-kobach">sued</a> [materials report] on behalf of three prospective voters shortly after the rule was approved by a state board. Approximately 17,600 people "registered at motor vehicles offices without providing citizenship papers." Fifty thousand people may be affected in November as the judge plans to revisit the issue on September 21 ahead the US Election Day. District Judge Larry Hendricks said in reference to voting that "there is no right that is more precious in a free country".</p>

<p>Issues relating to immigration and voting in elections have been hotly contested. In April Assistant Professor Michael Morley at Barry University School of Law <a href="/forum/2016/04/michael-morley-unanswered-evenwel.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] a Supreme Court ruling that dealt with voting rights and illegal immigration. Last November New Jersey lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-jersey-lawmakers-advance-immigrant-drivers-license-bill.php">advanced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain New Jersey driver's licenses. Last January the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-house-votes-to-block-funding-for-obamas-action-on-immigration.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a $40 billion funding bill for the Department of homeland Security that included amendments to repeal two key facets to President Barack Obama's immigration action. In 2014 Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/obama-announces-immigration-reforms.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] executive actions on immigration that would allow 4.7 million undocumented immigrants to stay in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] signed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s764/BILLS-114s764enr.pdf">Senate Bill No. 764</a> [bill, PDF] into law on Friday, which requires labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food products under a single national standard. The law requires the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome">Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) [official website] to write the rules for a "national mandatory bioengineered food disclosure standard" no later than two years after the signing of this bill into law. According to the bill, the disclosure may be in the form of a text, symbol, or electronic or digital ink. The USDA has also been directed to conduct a study to "identify  potential  technological  challenges  that may impact whether consumers would have access to the bio-engineering disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure methods," no later than one year after the enactment of this bill. The most important provision in this bill is perhaps contained in Section 293 (e) which states that:<blockquote>Notwithstanding section 295, no State or political subdivision of a State may directly or indirectly establish under any authority or continue in effect as to any food in interstate commerce  any requirement relating to the labeling or disclosure of whether a food is bioengineered or was developed or produced using bioengineering for a food that is the subject of the national bioengineered food disclosure standard under this section that is not identical to the mandatory disclosure requirement under that standard.</blockquote>This essentially means that any state which has enacted GMO labeling laws that are not identical to the federal standard will now be overridden. The passage of this law has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/obama-signs-bill-requiring-labeling-of-gmo-foods/2016/07/29/1f071d66-55d2-11e6-b652-315ae5d4d4dd_story.html">sparked outrage</a> [WP report] in the Vermont congressional delegation, which strongly objected to this law. Former presidential candidate <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/">Bernie Sanders</a>, and <a href="https://www.leahy.senate.gov/">Senator Patrick Leahy</a> [official websites] especially pointed to the tougher Vermont laws on GMO product labeling. Among other things, opponents state that the federal labeling standards are too lax and do not carry tough penalties for failure to comply.</p>

<p>GMO labeling has been a cause for concern in the US. In February 2014 Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/07/remarks-president-signing-farm-bill-mi">signed into law</a> [press release] a $956 billion <a href="http://agriculture.house.gov/sites/republicans.agriculture.house.gov/files/pdf/legislation/agriculturalact2014.pdf">farm bill</a> [text, PDF] providing expanded crop insurance and other benefits for the agricultural sector and also requiring changes in food labeling. The recent prevalence of GMO crops has been a point of contention in courts around the world. In May 2014 Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/vermont-governor-signs-bill-requiring-labels-on-gmo-foods.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring the labeling of food containing GMOs. In May 2013 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/supreme-court-rules-for-monsanto-in-seed-patent-dispute.php">ruled unanimously</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bowman-v-monsanto-co/">Bowman v. Monsanto</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that a farmer who buys patented seeds may not reproduce them through planting and harvesting without the patent holder's permission, even though the seeds are altered to self-replicate. In March 2011 the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/03/ecj-legal-adviser-finds-ban-on-genetically-modified-crops-illegal.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that a ban on cultivating GMO crops is illegal after France attempted to prohibit the production of a strain of genetically modified maize developed by Monsanto in 2008. In December 2010 a US federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-orders-destruction-of-genetically-engineered-plants.php">ordered the destruction</a> [JURIST report] of a crop of genetically engineered sugar beets due to its potential harmful effect on surrounding flora.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Brazilian authorities on Saturday arrested a man charged with committing war crimes in 1992 against the civilian population of former Yugoslavia. The search for wanted criminal Nikola Ceranic <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-crime-bosnia-idUSKCN10B00O">began</a> [Reuters report] in late June after Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) authorities forwarded an extradition request to the <a href="http://www.justica.gov.br/">Brazilian Justice Ministry</a> and <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verConteudo.php?sigla=portalStfSobreCorte_en_us&idConteudo=120283">Supreme Court</a> [official websites, in Portuguese]. Brazilian prosecutors and police cooperated with Bosnia to locate Ceranic near Sao Paulo. The authorities have yet to specify the details of Ceranic's crimes or how long he resided in Brazil. The Supreme Court must now decide on BiH's extradition request as required by Brazilian law. </p>

<p>War crimes against civilians continue to be a matter of international concern. On Friday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that Russia and Syria were using cluster bombs to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">target </a> [JURIST report] civilians and rebels in northern Syria despite their devastating and unpredictable nature. Earlier this month the <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] reported that civilian casualties in the country <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-reach-record-high-in-first-half-of-year.php"> reached a record high</a> [JURIST report] in the first half of 2016, with 5,166 civilians recorded killed or maimed. Also this month UN rights official Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-rights-chief-situation-increasingly-desperate-for-200000-trapped-in-syrian-towns.php">stressed</a> [JURIST report] that 200,000 civilians in three Syrian towns were trapped in the middle of the conflict between Syrian forces and ISIL. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Sunday urged Iraqi military commanders to prevent historically abusive militias from participating in the campaign to retake the city of Mosul from the Islamic State (IS). Last March the Iraqi army began <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/31/iraq-ban-abusive-militias-mosul-operation">working</a> [HRW report] with Peshmerga forces and affiliates of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) to launch a ground offensive against the IS, which had been holding Mosul since June 2014. Hadi al-Amiri, leader of the Badr Brigades, officially <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/06/iraq-mosul-is.html">stated</a> [text] in late June that the PMF would be taking part in the liberation of the city. HRW has stressed, however, that the PMF has a long reported history of abuses, including summary killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and the destruction of homes. In the May campaign to retake Fallujah, there were numerous reports of PMF members abusing civilians, performing executions, and mutilating corpses despite Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's prior declaration that the PMF would not enter the city. In light of the PMF's various reported offenses, HRW stated that the Iraqi army has a duty  to protect the civilian population and hold militia fighters accountable for past war crimes. </p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. In June a UN-mandated human rights inquiry reported that the IS has been committing <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-islamic-state-committing-genocide-against-yazidi-people.php">genocide</a> [JURIST report] against the Yazidi people, in addition to a carrying out a variety of other war crimes and human rights violations. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that IS "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Also, in March the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">unanimously passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and calling for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states. In December Amnesty International said that IS is in <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-islamic-state-armed-due-to-reckless-arms-trading-with-iraq.php">possession of a "large and lethal" arsenal</a> [JURIST report] due to decades of reckless arms trading and the poorly regulated international flow of weapons into Iraq. In November IS <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/arrests-made-in-connection-to-france-terrorist-attacks.php">claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated attacks in Paris</a> [JURIST report] that killed more than 120 individuals. In September members of Iraq's Yazidi community met with International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and urged the court to <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/iraq-yazidi-minority-urge-icc-genocide-investigation.php">open a genocide investigation</a> [JURIST report] into IS actions in Northern Iraq.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Monday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54602#.V5-DmaJBF40">expressed concern</a> [UN News Centre report] over efforts by the Iraqi government to expedite implementation of the death penalty. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi has created a committee to identify delays and accelerate the process. Zeid expressed concern that the committee would be operating in an already flawed system:<blockquote>Given the weaknesses of the Iraqi justice system, and the current environment in Iraq, I am gravely concerned that innocent people have been and may continue to be convicted and executed, resulting in gross, irreversible miscarriages of justice. ... Fast-tracking executions will only accelerate injustice.</blockquote>Zeid called for a moratorium on the death penalty. There are an estimated 1,200 inmates currently on death row in Iraq.</p>

<p>Iraq has long faced international criticism for its use of the death penalty. In February  <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-criticizes-iraq-over-death-sentences.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the state of justice in Iraq after a court sentenced 40 men to death. Last August a spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-denounces-iraq-executions.php">spoke against the execution</a> [JURIST report] of an Iraqi man and his two wives in the Kurdistan region. In 2014 UN officials called on the government of Iraq to <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-urges-iraq-to-place-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">impose a moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty in response to a significant rise in executions since the country restored capital punishment in 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Controversial new security laws took effect Monday in Malaysia. Backed by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22338100">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [BBC profile], the National Security Act will <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/malaysia-controversial-national-security-act-launched-160801062824956.html">allow government authorities</a> [Al Jazeera report] to declare martial law in areas deemed to be under a security threat. Police will be able to conduct warrantless searches, seize property and impose curfews. Najib has defended the legislation as necessary to combat terrorism, but rights groups such as Amnesty International have <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/malaysia-national-security-council-act-gives-authorities-unchecked-and-abusive-powers-0">criticized the measures</a> [press release] as draconian. "With this new law, the government now has spurned checks and assumed potentially abusive powers," said Josef Benedict, AI's Deputy Director for South East Asia and the Pacific. Others have noted that the laws come amid a scandal in which billions of dollars were stolen from a state investment fund that Najib founded and oversaw. He has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Much controversy has surrounded Najib's terms as prime minister. In October <a href="http://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] accused the government of abusing broad, vaguely worded laws to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/hrw-malaysia-laws-being-abused-to-jail-critics.php">jail its critics</a> [JURIST report]. In July of last year Najib <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/malaysia-prime-minister-fires-attorney-general-investigating-him-for-corruption.php">fired</a> [JURIST report] Attorney General Abdul Gani Patail after learning that Patail was investigating him for corruption. That same month, two major opposition parties <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an emergency sitting of parliament in order to discuss Najib's future as prime minister. In 2006, Najib was <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6582475.stm">accused</a> [BBC report] of being connected to the murder of Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu, after her remains were found in October of that year in Kuala Lumpur. Najib , who was deputy prime minister at the time, denied having any connections to the murder or even knowing the model. A political analyst and associate of Najib's was charged with <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30791602">aiding</a> [BBC report] the murder, but these charges were later dropped.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The prime minister of Cambodia filed a lawsuit alleging defamation against an opposition leader and opposition party leader on Monday. Primer Minister Hun Sen's lawyer <a href="http://www.voacambodia.com/a/cambodian-premier-sues-opposition-over-facebook-post/3444280.html">filed</a> [VOA report] suit against Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) President Sam Rainsy for posting on Facebook that "the fatal shooting of Kem Ley today is another terrorist act organized by the authorities." A separate lawsuit was also filed against CNRP Senator Thak Lany for <a href="http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/27920/pm-sues-rainsy-over-murder-claim/">allegedly saying</a> [Khmer Times report] during a public forum that she did not know "what [the Prime Minister] is thinking&#8212;Suddenly he killed Kem Ley, a political analyst." The lawsuits seek a 100 riel fine, approximately 2 cents in US dollars, and argue that both statements were defamatory and negatively impacted Hun Sen's reputation. Kem Ley was a popular political analyst, spoke critically of the government, and was shot and killed on July 10. The lawsuit is widely <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/cambodia/murder-accusations-cause-08012016160754.html">considered</a> [RFA report] a maneuver by the ruling party to suppress the opposition ahead of the local elections scheduled next year.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency in the Cambodian legislature and contention between political parties have caused international concern. In June the Cambodian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/cambodian-parliament-opens-investigation-into-opposition-leader.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to allow the Phnom Penh Municipal Court to open an investigation into opposition leader Kem Sohka regarding his alleged involvement with a prostitute. Last November the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, Rhona Smith, <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-warns-cambodias-political-polarization-reaching-breaking-point.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the increasing polarization of the political parties in Cambodia is reaching a breaking point. Also in November Cambodia opposition leader Rainsy was <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/cambodia-opposition-leader-removed-from-national-assembly.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] as a member of the country's National Assembly. That month a Cambodian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/three-men-charged-in-attack-on-opposition-leaders-in-cambodia.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] three men in the beating of two opposition lawmakers. In October the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-concerned-over-worsening-climate-for-opposition-politicians.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] concern over the "organized attack" on opposition politicians in Cambodia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese authorities released a prominent human rights lawyer from detention on Monday. Wang Yu was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/world/asia/human-rights-lawyer-is-released-in-china-after-videotaped-confession.html">released</a> [NYT report] on bail after confessing to "subverting state power" and rejecting awards from the American Bar Association and Ludovic Trarieux Prize for her work defending human rights, saying that they were intended to "blacken the reputation of the Chinese government." The televised confession alleged that "foreign forces" trained her and her colleagues to attack and smear the government of China. Yu's colleagues <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/01/jailed-chinese-lawyer-reappears-to-deliver-confession-but-the-script-seems-familiar/">claim</a> [WP report] that she would never say such things unless she were put under extreme pressure. Yu was detained over a year ago during China's "crackdown" on the legal and human rights activist community.</p>

<p>China's human rights record has drawn international scrutiny. Last month China was set to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php">prosecute</a> [JURIST report] a prominent human rights lawyer on charges of subverting state power. Also last month Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-china-must-end-oppression-of-human-rights-activistslawyers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Chinese authorities to "end their ruthless assault against human rights lawyers and activists." In June a report claimed that China continues to <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-continues-to-harvest-organs-of-prisoners-report.php">harvest organs</a> [JURIST report] from prisoners and those opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Also in June a UN expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-expert-fundamentalism-harming-rights-to-assembly-and-association.php">presented</a> [JURIST report] a report showing that fundamentalist intolerance is growing throughout the globe and is directly contributing to infringements of the rights to association and peaceful assembly. That same month a prominent Chinese civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-rights-lawyer-goes-on-trial.php">put on trial</a> for fraud during a crackdown on political dissent, a month after China passed a law <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-passes-law-restricting-ngos.php">restricting</a> [JURIST reports] non-governmental organization (NGOs).</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.ndd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of North Dakota</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/north-dakota-position.pdf">barred</a> [opinion, PDF] the state from enforcing its voter identification law. Judge Daniel Hovland issued a preliminary injunction, finding that the strict law had made it difficult or impossible for many Native Americans to vote. Under previous voter ID legislation, voters could present many different documents or swear an oath affirming their identity. However, under the 2013 law, acceptable documentation was limited to a valid state driver's license, a nondriver state ID, a state-issued long-term care certificate or a tribal identification card, and swearing an oath was no longer an option. Hovland wrote:<blockquote>The public interest in protecting the most cherished right to vote for thousands of Native Americans who currently lack a qualifying ID and cannot obtain one, outweighs the purported interest and arguments of the State. It is critical the State of North Dakota provide Native Americans an equal and meaningful opportunity to vote in the 2016 election. No eligible voter, regardless of their station in life, should be denied the opportunity to vote.</blockquote>North Dakota Secretary of State Alvin Jaeger has said the state does <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/north-dakota-voter-identification-law.html">not plan to appeal</a> [NYT report] and that the November election will be conducted under the pre-2013 standards.</p>

<p>North Dakota's law is the latest to be blocked by a court. Last week, voter restrictions were overturned in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-portions-of-north-carolina-voting-law.php">North Carolina</a> [JURIST reports]. In June a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter ID law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">bill that will allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://courts.delaware.gov/supreme/">Delaware Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=244410">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that the state's death penalty statute is unconstitutional. Citing a January US <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-overturns-florida-capital-sentencing-scheme.php">Supreme Court decision</a> [JURIST report] that found that Florida's death penalty scheme violated the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment">Sixth Amendment</a> [text], the Delaware court found that the law gives judges too great a role in imposing the death penalty. The court concluded:<blockquote>There is no circumstance in which it is more critical that a jury act with the historically required confidence than when it is determining whether a defendant should live or die. If, as a majority of us have concluded, the Sixth Amendment requires a jury to make all the necessary factual determinations relevant to a capital defendant's fate, there is no reason to depart from the long-standing beyond a reasonable doubt standard when the jury is making the crucial fact-laden judgment of whether the defendant should be executed. Put simply, the Sixth Amendment right to a jury includes a right not to be executed unless a jury concludes unanimously that it has no reasonable doubt that is the appropriate sentence.</blockquote>Delaware's attorney general has not yet indicated whether he plans to appeal, but an appeal could be unlikely to succeed given Supreme Court precedent.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/">Council of Europe</a> [official website] Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/secretary-general-jagland-in-ankara">arrived</a> [press releaserelease] in Turkey Wednesday to meet with a variety of Turkish, including President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım, urging respect for the rule of law. Following the first meeting in Ankara, Jagland stated that "[t]here has been too little understanding in Europe about the challenges facing democracy and state institutions in Turkey" following the attempted coup in July. The Secretary General further emphasized that, while he understands the recent call for justice, any investigation and judicial action taken must not violate the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf">European Convention on Human Rights</a> [text, PDF] or the precedent of the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home">European Court of Human Rights</a> [official website].</p>

<p>Jagland's visit comes after Erdoğan vowed last month that those involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">coup</a> [JURIST report] will "pay a heavy price" and the aftermath of the coup may be bloody and repressive as the state of human rights has been controversial in Turkey for years. At the end of last month, Erdoğan stated that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">approve reinstating</a> [JURIST report] the death penalty so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly. Last week Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-turkey-preventing-independent-investigation-into-mass-abuses-against-civilians.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey has blocked access for independent investigations into mass abuses against civilians. In 2015 then-Human Rights Commissioner for Germany <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/germany-commissioner-says-turkey-does-not-belong-in-eu.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that Turkey must improve its human rights record before it can be admitted to the EU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Canadian <a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng">Prime Minister Justin Trudeau</a> [official profile] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/08/02/prime-minister-announces-new-supreme-court-canada-judicial-appointments-process">announced</a> [press release] a new process for selecting Supreme Court justices that will allow all qualified individuals to apply for the position. Trudeau stated that, "[f]or the first time, any qualified Canadian lawyer or judge may apply for appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada through the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs." Those applications will be reviewed by a seven-member Advisory Board that will be chaired by former prime minister Kim Campbell, and four of the members will be appointed by "independent professional organizations." The questionnaire administered to candidates will also be made public.</p>

<p>Trudeau's administration has introduced a number of changes. In May Trudeau <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-pm-proposes-legislation-banning-transgender-discrimination.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] legislation that would ban transgender discrimination, including it within Canada's hate crime laws. Also in May Canada's Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett said that <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-adopts-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">it would drop</a> [JURIST report] its objector status against the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In April a long-awaited bill legalizing physician-assisted suicide was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/canada-introduces-long-awaited-bill-to-legalize-physician-assisted-suicide.php">introduced</a> [JURIST report] before the Parliament of Canada and is now awaiting passage through the House of Commons and the Senate. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/03/president-obama-commutes-sentences-214-additional-people">commuted</a> [report] the sentences of 214 federal inmates on Thursday, the most at one time during his presidency. Sixty-seven of the inmates whose sentences were commuted were serving life sentences for non-violent drug crimes. The most recent grant of clemency highlights Obama's call to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] to prioritize petitions for commutations by non-violent drug-felons who are facing heightened sentences, based on "outdated and unduly harsh" sentencing laws. Obama has now commuted the sentences of 562 individuals, more than the last nine presidents combined. The report ended with a call to the <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">Senate</a> [official websites] to craft a bi-partisan criminal justice reform bill for the president to sign.</p>

<p>This is the latest effort of  the Obama Administration to encourage <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/criminal-justice-reform">criminal justice reform efforts</a> [WH backgrounder]. In June the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/white-house-announces-plans-to-provide-state-and-federal-prisoners-grants-for-college-education.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a number of programs focused on better reintroducing released prisoners into the community. In January Obama <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/barack-obama-why-we-must-rethink-solitary-confinement/2016/01/25/29a361f2-c384-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html">ordered</a> [WP report] the Attorney General to review the use of solitary confinement. Conservative groups have <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2016/05/16/is-it-time-for-criminal-justice-reform-2-law-enforcement-groups-are-at-odds/">criticized</a> [Daily Signal report] the Obama's efforts as harming law enforcement's abilities to "dismantle and disrupt drug trafficking organizations." Republicans have also insisted on requiring federal prosecutors to "prove that white-collar defendants acted knowingly to violate the law," but the Administration and Democrats <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news-other-administration/268427-obama-met-with-grassley-goodlatte-on">maintain</a> [The Hill report] that those provisions would make it harder for the government to prosecute corporate crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2016-08-03/statement-attributable-spokesman-secretary-general-second">concern</a> [official statement] for the human rights violations faced by the Yazidi minority in Northern Iraq on Wednesday, stating that actions of the Islamic State (IS) may amount to genocide. Two years ago the IS attacked the Sinjar area in Iraq killing nearly 5,000 individuals. The statement claims that 3,200 Yazidi women and children remain in captivity and are subjected to nearly unimaginable violence. The Secretary-General proclaimed these crimes may constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity and even genocide. The UN encouraged the Iraqi government to bring perpetrators of these crimes to justice with a fair trial and due process while supporting the survivors. </p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that IS "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Also in March the US House of Representatives unanimously passed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and called for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states. In December Amnesty International said that IS is in possession of a "large and lethal" <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-islamic-state-armed-due-to-reckless-arms-trading-with-iraq.php">arsenal</a> [JURIST report] due to decades of reckless arms trading and the poorly regulated international flow of weapons into Iraq. In November IS claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated attacks in <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/arrests-made-in-connection-to-france-terrorist-attacks.php">Paris</a> [JURIST report] that killed more than 120 individuals. In September members of Iraq's Yazidi community met with International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and urged the court to open a genocide <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/iraq-yazidi-minority-urge-icc-genocide-investigation.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into IS actions in Northern Iraq.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A <a href="http://kdsg.gov.ng/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Report-of-the-Judicial-Commission-of-Inquiry-into-the-Zaria-Clashes.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released on Sunday by the <a href="http://kdsg.gov.ng">Kaduna State Government</a> [official website] stated, among other things, that "[t]he force used by the Nigerian Army resulting in the death of the 349 IMN members was disproportionate" and called for those involved to be "brought to trial before a [c]ourt of competent [j]urisdiction." The report details the clashes between the Nigerian Army and Islamic Movement in Nigeria in December 2015 and highlights how many of those killed were placed in mass graves. The report also recommended that the army "intensify efforts in ensuring compliance with the Rules of Engagement and other legal standards in Cordon and Search operations at all times."</p>

<p>Earlier this year <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-condemns-reinstatement-of-nigeria-general-accused-of-war-crimes.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the reinstatement of Nigeria's senior military general, Major General Ahmadu Mohammed, who was alleged to have actively participated in the mass murder of hundreds of detainees at the Giwa barracks detention center in March 2014. AI had previously named the major general along with eight other senior military commanders in June as potentially criminally responsible for their role in war crimes including the deaths of approximately 8,000 other detainees. AI's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr44/1657/2015/en/">investigation indicated</a> [AI report] that more than 7,000 people, including young boys, were starved, suffocated and tortured to death in military detention camps since March 2011, while another 1,200 were rounded up and unlawfully executed. AI had then stated that the military's actions at the detention camps are part of a "witch hunt" in an effort to locate and fight members of Boko Haram, who threaten the security of the nation. <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=boko%20haram&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">Boko Haram</a> [JURIST news archive], which means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/08/australia-abuse-neglect-of-refugees-on-nauru/">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/02/australia-appalling-abuse-neglect-refugees-nauru">Human Rights Watch</a> [reports] reported Wednesday that Australia is ignoring inhumane treatment of refugees on the South Pacific island of Nauru in the hopes of deterring additional refugees from traveling to Australia. Individuals caught trying to travel into the country are sent to a camp on Manus Island or in Nauru according to the country's immigration policy. These camps have been scrutinized for their harsh conditions, resulting in repeated instances of suicide. The Australian government claims the policy is in place to prevent individuals from downing at sea during their journey. In July a researcher from Amnesty International reported individuals on Nauru received inadequate medical care and were physically and sexually assaulted by residents. </p>

<p>A group of more than 750 detainees held on Manus Island <a href="/paperchase/S99%20Sealed%20Summons%20for%20Injunction.pdf">asked</a> [JURIST report] the Australian High Court in early May to order their transfer to mainland Australia and block a transfer to the detention center in the island nation of Nauru. In April the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/papua-new-guinea-top-court-rules-australia-offshore-detention-facility-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Australia's detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island in northern Papua New Guinea is illegal. The court found that the detention center violates Article 42 of Papua New Guinea's Constitution, which guarantees personal liberty. Following the challenge in May, the Papua New Guinea Immigration authorities reported that the refugees at the processing center on Manus Island were no longer <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/papua-new-guinea-announces-end-of-detainment-of-manus-island-asylum-seekers.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] and were allowed to leave the facility.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20339&LangID=E">said</a> Thursday that South Sudan government (SPLA) security forces have killed and raped citizens and looted and destroyed public and private property. The rights chief called on the UN Security Council to take stronger action against these events. While the report explains that some civilian deaths occurred because of combatant cross fire, there have been reported events where civilians were summarily executed by SPLA soldiers. It is estimated that the civilian death toll is more than 70, but that number is believed to be much higher. </p>

<p>Human rights concerns have been widespread concerning South Sudan. Last month <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/IDPersonsIndex.aspx">Chaloka Beyani</a> [official profile], UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20256&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press release] recent attacks on IDPs and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-expert-calls-for-end-of-hostilities-in-south-sudan.php">civilians in South Sudan</a> [JURIST report]. In June UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed</a> [JURIST report] shock at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries, including South Sudan. In May <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-south-sudan-detainees-held-in-inhumane-conditions.php">Amnesty International reported</a> [JURIST report] that dozens of detainees in South Sudan are being held in inhumane conditions. In April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/rights-groups-next-un-chief-must-stand-up-for-human-rights.php">six human rights organizations called</a> [JURIST report] for the next UN Secretary-General to do everything he or she can do to protect innocent civilians whose nation faced armed conflict, including South Sudan. In March the<a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-council-establishes-three-person-investigative-commission-in-south-sudan.php"> UN Human Rights Council decided</a> [JURIST report] to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in South Sudan.    </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="https://www.almd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/moore-v-jic.pdf">dismissed a suit</a> [opinion, PDF] filed by suspended Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore against the <a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/jic.cfm">Judicial Inquiry Commission</a> (JIC) [official website]. The federal judge found that he should not intervene in matters relating to a state's constitution and therefore dismissed the case. The state constitutional provision in question automatically remove a judge from duty when complaints are filed against them by the JIC.    </p>

<p><a href="http://judicial.alabama.gov/Bios/rmoore.cfm">Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore</a> [official website] was suspended after being <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-chief-justice-facing-suspension-over-same-sex-marriage-order.php">charged with violating ethical rules</a> [JURIST report]. The JIC <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/311766160/Roy-Moore-COJ-Complaint">accused</a> [complaint] Moore of failing to act impartially and refusing to follow the law when he <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/294755454/Administrative-order">ordered</a> [order] probate judges <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/alabama-chief-justice-halts-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">not to issue same-sex marriage licenses</a> [JURIST report] as their issuance ran contrary to Alabama law. Moore argued that the US Supreme Court ruling only applied to the plaintiff in the case, and that probate judges in Alabama had not been ordered to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The commission stated that Moore is bound by the Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution and has violated the law. This is the second time Moore has been removed from office, having also refused to adhere to a federal court order in 2003.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Deal reached to scale back Texas voter ID law for November election</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Texas agreed to a <a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000156-51c2-df27-ab7e-7de690d10000">deal</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday that will weaken their voter identification law and allow voters to cast ballots in the November election even if they lack all documents required by the law. The agreement will require Texas to spend at least $2.5 million in the months leading up to the election to increase voter awareness. Voters will now be able to present voter registration cards, birth certificates, utility bills, paycheck stubs and government documents with the voter's name and address as acceptable forms of ID. Voters will also be required to sign an affidavit stating that they could not obtain one of the required forms of ID. The deal must be approved by a federal judge. </p>

<p>The Texas voter ID law, first passed in 2011, is one of the strictest in the country. The law was blocked by the <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> [official website], which previously had the power to review voting changes in some jurisdictions under a preclearance requirement laid out in Sections 4 and 5 of the VRA. However, when the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-strikes-key-provision-of-voting-rights-act.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] Section 4 in 2013, there was no longer a basis for enforcing the requirement in those jurisdictions. Texas lawmakers announced their plans to reenact the voting law hours after the Court's decision. In October 2014 a district court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-supreme-court-strikes-down-texas-voter-id-law.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that SB 14 violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the US Constitution and filed a permanent <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-judge-blocks-texas-voter-id-law.php">injunction</a> [JURIST report] against its enforcement days later. However, an appeals court temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-texas-voter-id-law.php">reinstated</a> the law, stating that the upcoming elections were too close to make a change and the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/supreme-court-allows-texas-voter-id-law-for-upcoming-election.php">permitted</a> [JURIST reports] the law to be enforced. In March, the court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/federal-appeals-court-to-reconsider-texas-voter-id-law.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to reconsider Texas' voter identification law before the entire court, as opposed to a panel of just three judges. That month, the League of United Latin American Citizens and Congressman Marc Veasy, along with other plaintiffs, filed an <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/voters-ask-supreme-court-to-block-texas-voter-id-law.php">application</a> [JURIST report] with the Supreme Court, asking the Court to vacate a stay that allowed the voter ID law to remain in place during the 2014 midterm elections. The Court did not vacate the stay, but stated that if the Appeals Court did not make a ruling in this case by July 20, then the parties could seek relief from the Supreme Court.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng was sentenced to seven years in prison Thursday for his role as director of Beijing's Fengrui Law Firm. Zhou was accused of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-idUSKCN10F0RW">opposing</a> [Reuters report] China's government and political system. The verdict stated that Zhou encouraged lawyers to highlight sensitive cases and hired protestors to disturb the judicial system. This is the latest in what appears to be a widespread crackdown on human rights lawyers and activists across China.</p>

<p>In April a civil rights lawyer was arrested and <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">released</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking President Xi Jinping in relation to the Panama Papers release. Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiangon announced in April that his license to practice law was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-human-rights-lawyer-disbarred-for-criticizing-government.php">revoked</a> [JURIST report] by the judicial bureau. Chinese lawyer and professor Chen Taihe fled <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/chinese-rights-lawyer-flees-to-us-after-release.php">China</a> [JURIST report] in March and arrived in San Leandro, California, after he was detained last July as part of a crackdown on rights lawyers. The crackdown culminated in at least 242 people detained or questioned throughout the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] in February over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A divided US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/16A52.pdf">granted</a> [order, PDF] an application to recall and stay lower court orders allowing a transgender student who identifies as a male to use the men's restroom in school. This comes after the Gloucester County School Board <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/virginia-school-board-asks-supreme-court-to-block-order-in-transgender-bathroom-case.php">filed an emergency application</a> [JURIST report] to block the lower court decisions. <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-blocks-virginia-transgender-student-from-boys-restroom-1470257508">Many believe</a> [WSJ article] the court's choice to stay the lower court decisions signals the Supreme Court will take on the case on the merits later next year.</p>

<p>Gavin Grimm, a high school student at a Gloucester County school who identifies as male, was <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-judge-orders-school-board-to-allow-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">granted an order</a> [JURIST report] by the district court in June allowing him to use the boys' restroom while the court considers the legal issues of the case.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/">Governor Andrew Cuomo</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-legislation-legalize-and-regulate-fantasy-sports-new-york-state">signed legislation</a> [press release] Wednesday that would legalize daily fantasy sports in New York state. The law, <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2015/S8153">SB 8153</a> [official website], serves to legalize forms of daily fantasy sports, like Draft Kings, while requiring that companies using this platform register with the <a href="https://www.gaming.ny.gov/">New York State Gaming Commission</a> [official website], and adhere to its regulations. Cuomo said that SB 8153 "strikes the right balance" between providing consumer protection and allowing daily fantasy sports betting, which, until now, "operated with no supervision and no protections for players." In addition to providing this added protection, which includes identifying highly skilled players and protecting players' money once deposited, Cuomo and the state legislature estimate this bill will generate $4 million dollars for state education funding.</p>

<p>Many officials have stated that online fantasy sports may be an illegal form of gambling. In April the Tennessee Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/tennessee-ag-issues-opinion-against-fantasy-sports.php">issued an opinion</a> [JURIST report] stating that fantasy sports amounts to illegal gambling within the state. Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin released an advisory opinion in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hawaii-ag-declares-daily-sports-fantasy-sites-illegal.php">declaring</a> [JURIST report] that daily fantasy sports websites in which players pay to participate are considered gambling and are therefore illegal in the state. Also in January Texas Attorney General <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/texas-ag-declares-daily-sports-fantasy-sites-illegal.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] daily fantasy sports websites illegal within the state. Earlier that month the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/new-york-court-allows-daily-sports-fantasy-websites-to-continue-operating.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] FanDuel and Draftkings a stay allowing them to continue to operate within the state during their appeal. Last August the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled against New Jersey, deciding 2-1 to <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ban-on-sports-betting.php">uphold</a> [JURIST report] the federal ban on sports betting in all but four states. In December 2011 the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2011/12/doj-finds-online-non-sports-gambling-lawful.php">clarified its stance on online gambling</a> [JURIST report] in a memorandum opinion holding online non-sports related gambling that crosses state or international borders is not covered by the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-75/pdf/STATUTE-75-Pg491.pdf">Wire Act of 1961</a> [text, PDF].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] According to the state-run Anadolu news agency, an Istanbul court on Thursday <a href="http://aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkey-issues-arrest-warrant-for-fetullah-gulen/621743">issued an arrest warrant</a> [news release] for the Pennsylvania-based preacher Fetullah Gulen on charges of orchestrating the recent July 15 attempted coup, which left more than 270 dead. The court ruled that the so-called Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) had attempted to change constitutional order through infiltrating the Turkish Armed Forces, in hopes of overthrowing the current government. Gulen, who has been in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has been accused of "attempting to overthrow the Turkish government, depriving citizens of their liberty by using force, threat or fraud, [and] attempting to assassinate the president" among other charges, including multiple counts of murder. An Al Jazeera reporter <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/turkey-arrest-warrant-fethullah-gulen-160804134641736.html">stated</a> [Al Jazeera report] "this arrest warrant for Fethullah Gulen is more of a symbolic legal move," as the Gulen is in the US, meaning Turkey would need to make a formal extradition request.  The US has called for evidence in support of the accusations, stating the extradition process must be adhered to. In response to the charges, Gulen voiced his belief that "the Turkish court system is without judicial independence, so this warrant is yet another example of President Erdogan's drive for authoritarianism and away from democracy."</p>

<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed that those involved in the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">coup</a> [JURIST report] will "pay a heavy price." Last week Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkey-closes-thousands-of-private-schools-charities-and-other-institutions.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the closure of thousands of private schools, charities and other institutions. Also last week Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that he would approve reinstating the death penalty so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A three-member panel for the <a href="https://www.mahkamahagung.go.id/id">Supreme Court of Indonesia</a> [official website] rejected a radical Islamic leader's appeal of his conviction on Thursday. Abu Bakar Bashir, religious leader of the southeast-Asian Jemaah Islamiyah militants, had requested judicial review of his June 2011 conviction in relation to his military-style training camp, for which he was facing a 15-year prison sentence. According to the court spokesperson, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indonesian-court-rejects-radical-clerics-appeal/2016/08/04/2518c346-5a21-11e6-8b48-0cb344221131_story.html">no new evidence</a> [WP report] was presented in support of Bashir's appeal and the court "did not find any mistakes or irregularities in the verdicts by the district as well as high court." Bashir maintains that, although he had violated the state's firearm law by creating the camp, he was simply following God's orders in seeking to protect Islam and fellow muslims. The camp brought together a variety of extremist groups from around the Muslim world. It is believed Bashir and the group of radical Islamic militants had been planning attacks on various groups in Indonesia, including foreigners, moderate leaders, and former President Susilo Bambang Ydhoyono.</p>

<p>Bashir's trial <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/radical-indonesia-cleric-tried-for-terrorism.php">began in February 2011</a> [JURIST report] in the District Court of South Jakarta. He was convicted of inciting terrorism in connection with the terrorist training camp in May after having <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/indonesia-cleric-pleads-not-guilty-to-terror-charges.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] the month before. He was suspected of links to <a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/9126/alqaeda_aka_alqaida_alqaida.html">al Qaeda</a> [CFR backgrounder; JURIST news archive] and <a href="http://cfrterrorism.org/groups/jemaah.html">Jemaah Islamiyah</a> (JI) [CFR backgrounder], a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda that has been implicated in a number of attacks in Indonesia, including the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=">2002 Bali nightclub bombing</a> [JURIST news archive] that left more than 200 people dead. In 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2006/12/indonesia-high-court-overturns.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] Bashir's conviction on conspiracy charges connecting him with the bombings. He was <a href="/paperchase/2006/06/australia-distressed-over-release-of.php">released from prison</a> [JURIST report] earlier in 2006 after spending 26 months in jail on different charges related to the bombings.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3005347/4th-Circuit-Stay-Denial.pdf">denied</a> [text, PDF] a motion by North Carolina officials to stay an earlier order striking down the state's voter ID law. The law was <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-portions-of-north-carolina-voting-law.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] last week after a finding of discriminatory intent. The state filed the motion to stay the order while it seeks an appeal to the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website]. The order denying the motion states that the law "compels the injunction" and that "recalling or staying the mandate now would only undermine the integrity and efficiency of the upcoming election." The order also mentions that the state is able to comply with the order, and should do so by returning to prior voting methods from before the law was enacted.</p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Earlier this week a federal judge barred <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-judge-blocks-north-dakota-voter-id-law.php">North Dakota</a> [JURIST report] from enforcing its voter ID law. Last month, voter restrictions were overturned not only in North Carolina, but in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports]. In June a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting</a> [JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter ID law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a bill that will <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN Special Rapporteur on the right of freedom of opinion and expression David Kaye and the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/">Inter-American</a> (IACHR) [official website] Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression Edison Lanza <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20343&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [UN news release] on Thursday over the deterioration of media freedom in Venezuela. Saying they were "deeply disturbed by the recent reports of attacks against journalists and independent media groups," Kaye and Lanza stressed the need for these individuals' protection, as any such attack or threat violate not only the right of those harmed, but "the ability of Venezuelans and others elsewhere to be informed on events of critical importance." Among the numerous instances media suppression, the two noted the arrest of 7 journalists and media workers, along with seizure of their work equipment. Kaye emphasized that law enforcement should provide safety to these individuals and not harassment. The two also noted a variety of other issues affecting freedom of expression and access to media within the country. Lanza expressed concern at a recent Supreme Court of Venezuela ruling, ordering two news websites from posting videos of lynching on its webpage or through social media, stating "the right to freedom of expression cannot be subject to prior censorship." Issue was also taken with papers shortages which harm newspapers' ability to print copies of their editions, closures of radio stations, and failure of appropriate agencies to address requests for license renewal. Kaye and Lanza issued a joint letter to the Venezuelan Government, the reception of which was confirmed by the state, in hopes of voicing international concern and creating an open dialogue into media suppression.</p>

<p>Venezuela has routinely been called out for their human rights abuses. Amnesty International reported in March 2015 that Venezuela effectively <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/amnesty-venezuela-allowing-more-abuses-by-failing-to-investigate-2014-protests.php">allows more violence</a> [JURIST report] and abuses through its failure to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of the injuries and tortures during 2014 protests. Between February 2015 and July 2014, demonstrators <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26676806">gathered to protest government authority</a> [BBC report], resulting in conflict with police and the deaths of 43 people and the injury of 878. In response to the conflict, rights groups criticized Venezuelan security forces of <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/hrw-venezuela-security-forces-abusing-protesters.php">abusing and unlawfully detaining protesters</a>, and <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/un-human-rights-chief-calls-for-end-to-violence-in-venezuela.php">called for an end to violence</a> [JURIST reports] in the country. Such violent demonstrations were partially motivated by Venezuela's current <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-25745959">economic difficulties</a> [BBC backgrounder] and disdain towards current President Nicolas Maduro. In 2013 Venezuela <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/09/venezuela-withrdraws-from-international-human-rights-court.php">withdrew</a> from the IACHR despite criticism from activists and <a href="/paperchase/2012/09/un-high-commissioner-asks-venezuela-to-stay-in-human-rights-court.php">calls by the UN</a> [JURIST reports] for the country to remain a member.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20344&LangID=E">criticized</a> [press release] Iran for the mass execution of 20 people this week, calling the action "deplorable." The prisoners were all convicted of terrorism-related offenses, but the commissioner expressed doubt as to the fairness of those trials, deriding Iran as having expressed a "disdain" toward due process. In his statement, the commissioner called the executions a "grave injustice" and pointed out that many of those killed were part of a religious minority.</p>

<p>Much international pressure has been directed toward Iran in recent years for its human rights abuses. In June UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-concerned-over-conviction-and-sentencing-of-artists-in-iran.php">called for the release of artists</a> [JURIST report] jailed by the nation. In March UN rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-rate-of-juvenile-executions-in-iran.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the overwhelming number of juvenile executions in Iran. Last October UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-rights-experts-condemn-iran-execution-of-juvenile-offenders.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iran's execution of a juvenile offender convicted of murdering her husband whom she was forced to marry at the age of 16. She was executed despite several reports of flaws in her trial and appeals process. Also in October an Iranian Revolutionary Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/washington-post-journalist-convicted-in-iran-court.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] <em>Washington Post</em> correspondent Jason Rezaian, who was later released. In May of last year UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-experts-condemn-increase-in-iran-executions.php">condemned </a>[JURIST report] the growing number of executions in Iran in recent years. According to the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Iran and on extrajudicial executions, Iran had executed approximately six people per day between April 9 and April 26 and 350 total up to that point.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Brazilian <a href="http://www2.camara.leg.br/english/the-federal-senate">Senate</a> [official website; Spanish] committee on Thursday voted 14-5 to continue impeachment proceedings against suspended president Dilma Rousseff, who is charged with "[failing] to comply with tax and budget laws on the issues of additional credit decrees." Following the committee's <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2016/08/05/President-Dilma-Rousseff-moves-one-step-closer-to-impeachment-trial/6201470391424/">decision</a> [UPI article] to continue on with the impeachment, the full Senate will hold a vote to determine whether the final trial phase is to occur. The Senate will require a majority vote&#8212;41 senators&#8212;in order to initiate a final impeachment vote of Rousseff, who is accused of using accounting methods to hide the nation's growing budget deficit. Those in opposition to the vote <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-senate-panel-recommends-impeach-remove-rousseff-1470329532">criticized</a> [WSJ report] the proceeding as little more than an upper-class coup d'etat against the working class.</p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been recently brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigations. In May Brazil's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-house-speaker-suspended-for-obstructing-corruption-investigation.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha after being suspected of obstructing investigations into his allegedly corrupt activities. That same month local Brazilian media <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-call-for-investigation-of-president.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the country's top prosecutors had requested an investigation into Rousseff over alleged connected to the Petrobras corruption scandal. In April the Brazil Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/brazil-supreme-court-takes-over-corruption-case-against-former-president.php">agreed to hear</a> [JURIST report] a corruption case against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, which he appealed to the UN Human Rights Committee, arguing his investigation has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-appeals-to-un-for-rights-violation-in-corruption-investigation-1.php">riddled with impartiality and abuse of power</a> [JURIST report] by the presiding judge. Although there is widespread opposition against Rousseff, her supporters who have <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazils-workers-party-plans-to-rally-behind-the-president-for-the-may-day-celebration.php">rallied</a> [JURIST report] in her support in the past could spell future turmoil in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A group of UN independent human rights experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20340&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [UN news release] Thursday for the condition of Chinese human rights defender Yang Maodong, also known as Guo Feixiong, who has been detained by the Chinese government. Noting reports of degrading and humiliating treatment endured by Guo at the hands of both prison guards and other inmates, the experts called on the Chinese government to provide Guo with specialized medical care and stop all forms of mistreatment. The experts stated that, due to his status as a prominent human rights defender, Guo has been denied adequate medical treatment and forced to suffer "sleep deprivation, harassment, and [a] humiliating medical procedure filmed by prison officials for public release." Demanding the Chinese government follow these suggestions, and also calling for the release of Guo from prison, the rights experts stated the government's actions were "incompatible with China's obligations under international human rights law." In addition to China's failure to adhere to international law, the experts recalled several previous instances of China's failure to heed the advice of international human rights committee, including a call by the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cat/pages/catindex.aspx">UN Committee against Torture</a> [official website] "to refrain from prosecuting human rights, defenders, lawyers, petitioners and others for their legitimate activities." Guo was arrested and sentenced to six-years in August 2013 for participating in a public protest after a Guangzhou newspaper was censored by the government, one in a string of arrests against prominent human rights activists during <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11551399">Xi Jinping's</a> presidency [BBC backgrounder].</p>

<p>Also this week Chinese human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng was <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/china-sentences-lawyer-to-7-years-in-jail-for-subversion.php">sentenced to seven years</a> [JURIST report] in prison for his role as director of Beijing's Fengrui Law Firm. In April a civil rights lawyer was arrested and <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">released</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking Xi in relation to the Panama Papers release. Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiangon announced in April that his license to practice law was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-human-rights-lawyer-disbarred-for-criticizing-government.php">revoked</a> [JURIST report] by the judicial bureau. Chinese lawyer and professor Chen Taihe fled <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/chinese-rights-lawyer-flees-to-us-after-release.php">China</a> [JURIST report] in March and arrived in San Leandro, California, after he was detained last July as part of a crackdown on rights lawyers. The crackdown culminated in at least 242 people detained or questioned throughout the country. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">concern</a> [JURIST report] in February over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2015cv1580-52">dismissed</a> [Opinion, PDF] on Friday dismissed a lawsuit filed by third party presidential candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein against the <a href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> [official website] requesting that third party candidates be included in the presidential debate this year. The candidates did not receive invitations to the debates and sought court intervention claiming a violation of antitrust law. The court held that "because Plaintiffs have no standing and because antitrust laws govern commercial markets and not political activity those claims fail as a matter of well established law."<br />
In response to the contention that their First Amendment rights had been violated, the court held that those claims also failed because the First Amendment protects the rights of citizens not to be infringed upon by government action, not private action. An <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/08/judge-rejects-suit-against-presidential-debate-commission-226720">appeal is possible</a> [Politico Report].</p>

<p>The Commission on Presidential Debates is a "private non-partisan" organization which sponsors political debates. It is an independent organization run by a Board of Directors. In order to be invited to participate in the presidential debates a candidate must, among other things, "appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning a majority vote in the Electoral College" and receive "at least 15 percent of the national electorate as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organizations." Major party nominees Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will participate in the debate, but final determinations regarding any other candidate will be made after Labor Day.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary General Ban Ki Moon</a> [official profile] on Thursday <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2016-08-04/statement-attributable-spokesman-secretary-general-agreement-between">applauded</a> [press release] the European Union for donating 50 million euro (approximately $55,435,000 USD) to the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF).

The Secretary General also commended the nations in the region for their "enhanced cooperation and coordination" which has led to "significant progress" in the fight against terrorism in the region.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">The UN Children's Emergency Fund</a> (UNICEF) [official website] <a href="http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/southsudan_92046.html">warned</a> [press release] on Thursday that the ongoing conflict in South Sudan has caused the number of malnourished children in the nation to dramatically increase. While South Sudan's population <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54635#.V6dwxpMrK34">suffered</a> [UN News report] malnutrition prior to the conflict's inception in 2013, UNICEF stated that seven of South Sudan's ten states have now passed the malnutrition emergency threshold, meaning that at least 15 per cent of the population is malnourished. With more than one third of the population suffering food shortages, approximately 120,000 children have been treated for malnutrition since January, and UNICEF expects to support 250,000 malnourished children this year. The ongoing conflict, however, has hindered the agency's efforts and forced food supplies to be distributed via air transport. UNICEF is trying to raise $154.5 million to help provide the population with healthcare, education and basic necessities, but the agency has only raised about $52 million thus far. </p>

<p>Children have been at-risk groups in various conflicts worldwide. In June, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">denounced</a> [JURIST report] the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran and South Sudan. In March, the Myanmar government <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">released</a> [JURIST report] 46 underage and child recruits from the military as part of a UN joint action plan made in 2012. In February, the UN's Leila Zerrougui <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-envoy-conflicts-in-2015-take-huge-toll-on-children.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that children worldwide continued to face human rights violations in 2015, particularly in Middle Eastern and African countries. Also in February, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-ukraine-hostilities-have-damaged-hundreds-of-schools.php">declared</a> [JURIST report] that hostiles in eastern Ukraine had damaged or destroyed hundreds of schools, many of which were being used for military purposes. Furthermore, UN human rights experts in Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-urge-nigeria-to-ensure-safety-of-liberated-areas.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government to guarantee the safety of areas liberated from Boko Haram. Also earlier that month, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-express-utmost-alarm-at-worsening-situation-in-syria.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] "utmost alarm" at the worsening situation in Syria and said that parties were "constantly sinking to new depths" attacking women, children, the sick and the elderly. <br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Friday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/05/armenia-arbitrary-detentions-brutal-beatings">denounced</a> [press release] the detention and abuse of peaceful protesters in Armenia. Amidst growing dissatisfaction with the Armenian government, protesters have recently held frequent demonstration in the capital city of Yerevan. HRW reports that, despite the occurrence of occasional violence, such protests have been peaceful yet have been met with a disproportionately aggressive response from Yerevan's police force. While Armenian law does criminalize organized mass disorder, HRW states that such protests have not met such a classification since there has been no violence or destruction of property. Nevertheless, peaceful demonstrators have reportedly been beaten, forcibly detained, and given excessive criminal charges. Detainees were also allegedly denied human rights such as prompt access to medical care or legal representation. Furthermore, the number of detained and charged protestors has not been properly documented or publicized. Armenia's <a href="http://www.ccc.am/en/">Special Investigative Service</a> [official website] has begun investigations into the reports of police brutality. HRW has urged Armenia to hold authorities accountable for violating the human rights of peaceful protestors and their leaders.</p>

<p>HRW's recent report follows a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/week-standoff-ends-armenia-gunmen-surrender-160731173144467.html">two-week standoff</a> [Al Jazeera report] between Armenian authorities and armed men barricaded in a police station. On July 17, a group of 31 radicals infiltrated the station demanding the release of their group leader. The radicals reportedly killed one policeman and took a total of eight hostages. The hostage situation attracted supportive protestors who made nightly demonstrations until the radicals finally surrendered to authorities last Sunday. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand referendum voters on Sunday supported a draft of a new Constitution submitted by a military-appointed counsel, according to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36972396">unofficial numbers</a> [BBC report]. Although the turnout was low, a clear majority has determined the document will help restore stability in the country, while those against the draft believe it will entrench the military's control. Prior to the vote, protests and campaigns against the draft were outlawed, and many activists were detained. The voters also supported a measure that will involve a completely appointed 250-seat Senate in selecting a prime minister, whereas the previous Senate was roughly half elected officials.</p>

<p>Human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand since the military junta came to power in May 2014. Thai military officials in July charged three <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/three-human-rights-defenders-charged-in-thailand-over-report-on-torture.php">human rights defenders</a> [JURIST report] with criminal defamation and violations of the Computer Crimes Act because of a report they published detailing acts of torture in Thailand. In March Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-thailand-%20should-stop-%20retaliating-against-%20human-rights-lawyers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to stop harassing and charging human right lawyers for defending victims of the government's abuses. Also in March the Pheu Thai Party <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/thailand-government-accused-of-human-rights-violations.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights over the detention of one of its key figures, Watana Muangsook, accusing the government of serious human rights violations. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called on the Thai government to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-thailand-must-fully-investigate-forced-disappearances.php">fully investigate</a> [JURIST report] the whereabouts of at least 82 people listed as disappeared and criminalize forced disappearance through legislation. That same month, Thailand unveiled the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/thailands-draft-constitution-unveiled.php">new draft constitution</a> [JURIST report], which human rights groups stated was aimed at increasing the power of the military under the guise of clauses intended to promote national security permitting them to commit human rights abuses without fear of punishment in violation of international treaties.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An Iranian judiciary spokesman announced on Sunday that a nuclear scientist was executed for providing the US with state secrets. Shahram Amir previously <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/07/middleeast/iran-nuclear-scientist-executed/">went missing</a> [CNN report] in 2009 while embarking on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. Amir reemerged in the US in 2010 and returned to Tehran, claiming that he had been abducted by the CIA to release secrets about Iran's nuclear program. US officials argued that Amir had willingly defected, and Amir was soon after detained and charged with treason and espionage. After lower courts sentenced Amir to death, the Iranian High Court reviewed Amir's case and affirmed the conviction.  </p>

<p>Over the past several years Iran has been subject to numerous sanctions for its contentious nuclear program. Iranian leaders have repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-says-it-will-continue-to-expand.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the developing nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the international community, Israel in particular, worries that Iran's enrichment program was designed for military purposes. In January Iran <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/iran-denounces-new-us-sanctions-over-its-ballistic-missile-program.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the US for imposing new sanctions in connection with the country's missile defense program.The US and France <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/us-and-france-want-stronger-nuclear-talks-with-iran.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in March 2015 to strengthen nuclear talks with Iran to persuade the nation to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions and the following April Iran <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/iran-agrees-to-framework-of-nuclear-deal.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to a framework deal to restrict its nuclear plan. Developments in this regard were largely positive and resulted in subtle improvement in ties between the US and Iran. In July 2015, the UN International Atomic Energy Agency <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/iaea-iran-keeping-nuclear-commitments.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Iran has been keeping its commitment as part of a preliminary nuclear deal from 2013 barring Iran from expanding nuclear programs during negotiations. The Iranian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/post-1.php">accepted </a> [JURIST report] the nuclear agreement the following October and moved the process on to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/03/iran_power/html/guardian_council.stm">Guardian Council </a>[BBC backgrounder], which <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-nuclear-deal-approval-final-step/27306357.html">determined</a> [FRE/RL report] the legislation was consistent with the constitution and Islamic law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday identified approximately 150 serving and former state officials who are allegedly involved in the nation's illegal drug trade. Duterte <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/world/asia/duterte-philippine-president-links-150-public-servants-to-drugs.html?_r=0">stated</a> [NYT report] that all named officials, which includes mayors, judges, legislators, policeman and military personnel, have been relieved of duty and have 24 hours to surrender to their respective authorities before being hunted down. While Duterte's recent war on drugs has <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/rodrigo-duterte-human-rights-160806211448623.html">drawn major criticism</a> [Aljazeera report] from international human rights groups due to his extreme methods, Duterte claims that he must fulfill his duty to end the "pandemic" of drug abuse despite the risk of violating human rights. Furthermore, Duterte has dared opposing politicians to stop him and has promised to protect police officers who may be criticized for executing campaign. Since Duterte has taken office, about 400 suspected drug dealers have been killed and 600,000 have surrendered to the police. </p>

<p>The Filipino government has sought to curb the corruption that plagues the nation for years. Last month, the Supreme Court of the Philippines <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/philippine-supreme-court-orders-immediate-release-of-former-president.php">ordered the immediate release</a> [JURIST report] of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who has been kept in hospital detention for nearly five years on charges of election fraud, plundering, and corruption. Arroyo was arrested after then-President Benigno Aquino <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/philippines-president-creates-truth-commission-to-probe-rights-abuses.php">signed an executive order</a> [JURIST report] in July 2010 to set up a "truth commission" to investigate allegations that the outgoing administration engaged in corruption and rights violations. Duterte took the presidential office in May after <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-president-duterte-takes-office-filipinos-divided-on-dirty-harry-1467320403">promising</a> [WSJ report] the Filipino population that he will restore their broken society, redistribute the wealth, and aggressively crackdown on corruption and crime. During his campaign, Duterte <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/rodrigo-duterte-links-150-judges-and-politicians-to-drugs-trade">declared</a> [Guardian report] that 100,000 people would die in his crackdown on crime. Duterte has further stated that he <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/rodrigo-duterte-human-rights-160806211448623.html">disregards</a> [Aljazeera report] criticisms from the UN and human rights groups. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The District Court in Braunschweig, Germany, <a href="http://www.landgericht-braunschweig.de">ruled</a> [press release, in German] Monday that a collective complaint against Volkswagen AG (VW) may move forward. Like US-style class-action lawsuits, the collective complaint was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/german-court-allows-lawsuits-against-volkswagen-to-move-forward-1470664803">launched</a> [WSJ report] on behalf of multiple investors who lost money following the diesel emissions cheating scandal. Unlike US-style class-action lawsuits, a German court must choose one case to decide and then apply to the ruling to other cases. The district court has received 170 investor lawsuits alleging that VW <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-08-08/investor-suits-against-volkswagen-move-ahead-in-germany">failed to inform investors</a> [AP report] of the impending scandal. The lawsuits add up to approximately €4 billion (USD $4.4 billion), and the district court will choose a pilot case by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Last month, a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California gave <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-volkswagen-settlement.php">preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to a $15 billion settlement between VW and the US Environmental Protection Agency, California officials and consumers. In June VW <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/volkswagen-settles-over-allegations-of-cheating-emissions-tests-and-deceiving-customers.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to spend up to $14.7 billion to settle allegations of cheating emissions tests and deceiving customers in a settlement with US regulators. In March the Federal Trade Commission filed <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ftc-sues-volkswagon-for-false-advertising.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] against VW for false advertising. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/64d3033b-525c-4c1d-96a7-c0f8978218d0/1/doc/14-826_OPN.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/64d3033b-525c-4c1d-96a7-c0f8978218d0/1/hilite/">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court ruling that barred Ecuadoran plaintiffs from collecting a USD $8.646 billion Ecuadoran judgment against Chevron Corp. The lower court had concluded in 2014 that the Ecuadoran judgment was obtained through corruption and fraud and barred the plaintiffs' attorney, Steven Donziger, from attempting to enforce the judgment or profit from the award anywhere in the world. The appeals court affirmed the lower court's judgment that concluded that Donziger and his team had secretly authored the judgment and offered the Ecuadoran judge $500,000 to sign it. The appeals court also said that [the lower court's decision does not invalidate the judgment and does not prevent the enforcement of the judgment outside the US. The dispute arises from allegations by Ecuadoran plaintiffs that Chevron played a role in environmental damage in the Amazon rain forest. Chevron <a href="https://www.chevron.com/ecuador/background/#b3">disputes these claims</a> [backgrounder], and Donziger <a href="http://stevendonziger.com/chevrons-attacks-retaliation/">maintains</a> [backgrounder] his innocence and that he is the victim of a coordinated campaign against him by Chevron.</p>

<p>In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rejects-ecuador-challenge-to-chevron-arbitration-award.php">declined</a> [JURIST report] to hear a challenge by Ecuador over an arbitration award to Chevron. Last September the Supreme Court of Canada <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/canada-top-court-rules-for-ecuador-villagers-in-suit-against-chevron.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in favor of Ecuadoran villagers seeking to enforce a multi-million dollar judgment against Chevron. In March 2014 Chevron <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/chevron-seeking-32-million-in-legal-fees-in-ecuador-case.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] for reimbursement of attorneys' fees against Donziger and others in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The court also <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/federal-judge-blocks-us-courts-from-enforcing-chevron-judgment.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that month that the Ecuadoran judgment against Chevron was obtained through "corrupt means." In November 2013 an Ecuadoran court <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/ecuador-high-court-halves-judgment-against-chevron.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Chevron to pay $9.51 billion USD in fines and legal fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/media.aspx?IsMediaPage=true">urged</a> [press release] the Maldives to abide by a decades-old moratorium on the death penalty. The country has operated according to the de facto moratorium for decades, but last November brought changes to the judicial climate, halting death sentences being commuted into life sentences. There are three prisoners who are considered in imminent threat of execution. Zeid commented that "[t]he death penalty is not effective in deterring crime. Revenge must never be confused with justice, and the death penalty only serves to compound injustice."</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue worldwide. Last month Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">approve reinstating the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly. In May a spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-condemns-iran-sentencing-of-human-rights-activist.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iranian authorities for the sentencing of Nargis Mohammadi, an anti-death penalty activist. Also in May <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-chief-welcomes-pfizer-measures-to-prevent-use-of-drugs-for-executions.php">Zeid welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the measures being taken by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to prevent the use of its drugs in state-sponsored execution by lethal injection. UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-condemn-belarus-use-of-death-penalty.php">human rights experts expressed</a> [JURIST report] grave concern earlier that month over Belarus' death penalty practices after reports surfaced that a man was executed while his case was before the UN Human Rights Committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] ruled Tuesday that former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich must serve the rest of his 14-year sentence in a Colorado prison. Judge James Zagel <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-illinois-blagojevich-idUSKCN10K1X0">ruled</a> [Reuters report] that Blagojevich's sentence should not be reduced, rejecting his plea for leniency. Blagojevich's lawyers said that it was likely this ruling will be appealed. </p>

<p>In March the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from the former Illinois governor and upheld the ruling by the Seventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-blagojevichs-appeal-of-corruption-convictions.php">maintaining his 14-year sentence</a> [JURIST report]. In 2015 five of the 18 convictions against the former governor were thrown out. In 2013 Blagojevich was retried and and sentenced to 14 years after being convicted of 18 charges of corruption. Blagojevich was <a href="/paperchase/2010/08/blagojevich-guilty-of-false-statements-to-fbi-jury-hung-on-other-23-counts.php">initially found guilty</a> [JURIST report] in 2010 of making false statements to the FBI, but the jury remained deadlocked on 23 additional charges. The prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2011/02/blagojevich-judge-grants-motion-to-dismiss-3-charges.php">dropped some of the charges</a> [JURIST report] to simplify the case for retrial, including charges for racketeering. In January 2009 the Illinois State Senate <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/illinois-senate-removes-blagojevich.php">voted unanimously</a> [JURIST report] to convict Blagojevich of abuse of power and remove him from office. Blagojevich and his former chief of staff John Harris were <a href="/paperchase/2008/12/fbi-agents-arrest-illinois-governor-on.php">initially arrested</a> [JURIST report] in December 2008 on corruption charges, including allegations that they conspired to sell the Senate seat left vacant by US President Barack Obama.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/">International Crimes Tribunal Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/ict1/Judgment%20part%202/ICT-BD%2004%20of%202015.pdf">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF] a former member of parliament to death and seven others to life in prison for crimes committed during the 1971 war for independence. Sakhawat Hossain, a former lawmaker and member of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, was <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/bangladesh-sentences-mp-death-war-crimes-1971-41260886">accused</a> [AP report] of commanding a group that aided Pakistani soldiers. His lawyers have said they plan to appeal. One of the other defendants was present in court along with Hossain, and the remaining six defendants were tried and convicted in absentia.</p>

<p>The ICTB, established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with to detaining, prosecuting and punishing persons responsible for committing genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes under international law committed during the 1971 conflict. Rights groups such as <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] have <a  href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." In June the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-man-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] Mohibur Rahman to death for his part in the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. In May the Supreme Court of Bangladesh upheld the <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangladesh-high-court-upholds-islamist-leaders-death-sentence.php">death sentence issued by the ICTB</a> [JURIST report] against Islamist leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Brazil <a href="http://www2.camara.leg.br/english/the-federal-senate">Senate</a> [official website] officially <a href="http://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/materias/2016/08/10/senado-vai-julgar-presidente-dilma-rousseff-por-crimes-de-responsabilidade-1">indicted</a> [press release, in Portuguese] President Dilma Rousseff on Wednesday, marking the beginning of an impeachment trial against the embattled president. The Senate, which held a 16-hour session while deliberating on how to proceed, voted 59-21 against the suspended president&#8212;five more votes than were required to begin the impeachment proceedings. The vote comes less than a week after a Brazilian Senate committee <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/brazil-senate-committee-votes-for-rousseff-impeachment-trial.php">decided to advance</a> [JURIST report] Rousseff's case to the full Senate. Rousseff is alleged to have manipulated government budget accounts and spent without congressional approval. Rousseff and her supporters believe the most recent development in Rousseff's impeachment only further evidences a political witch-hunt by the elite-class against Rousseff, a strong proponent of social welfare projects.</p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been recently brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigations. In May Brazil's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-house-speaker-suspended-for-obstructing-corruption-investigation.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha after being suspected of obstructing investigations into his allegedly corrupt activities. That same month local Brazilian media <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-call-for-investigation-of-president.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the country's top prosecutors had requested an investigation into Rousseff over alleged connected to the Petrobras corruption scandal. In April the Brazil Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/brazil-supreme-court-takes-over-corruption-case-against-former-president.php">agreed to hear</a> [JURIST report] a corruption case against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, which he appealed to the UN Human Rights Committee, arguing his investigation has been <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-appeals-to-un-for-rights-violation-in-corruption-investigation-1.php">riddled with impartiality and abuse of power</a> [JURIST report] by the presiding judge. Although there is widespread opposition against Rousseff, her supporters who have <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazils-workers-party-plans-to-rally-behind-the-president-for-the-may-day-celebration.php">rallied</a> [JURIST report] in her support in the past could spell future turmoil in the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=baltimore%20police%20department">Baltimore Police Department</a> (BPD) [official website] has engaged in tactics that violate the First and Fourth Amendments and numerous anti-discrimination laws, according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/883366/download">report</a> [report] released by the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] on Wednesday. The report is centered on the use of excessive force and illegal stops, seizures and searches, especially within the African-American community. Most at fault for the systemic discrimination against African-American citizens, the DOJ said, are "deficient policies, training and accountability systems," including the "zero-tolerance" street enforcement. A variety of statistics were used to highlight the problem within the Baltimore, among which was a finding by the DOJ that African Americans accounted for over 80 percent of all BPD vehicle stops, despite white individuals being found with contraband twice as often. The report also found cause to believe that the BPD has engaged in discrimination against those with mental health disabilities and those seeking to exercise their First Amendment right to free expression. The DOJ and BPD entered into an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/883376/download">agreement in principle</a> [materials, PDF] wherein the BPD perform new training, data collection and community policing, and BPD will create a better technology and infrastructure to monitor abuses of authority by police officers. The DOJ's report follows the <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-charged-in-freddie-gray-death.php">death of Freddie Gray</a> [JURIST report] and ensuing protests in 2015.</p>

<p>The remaining officers indicted in Freddie Gray's death recently had their <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/charges-dropped-against-remaining-officers-in-freddie-gray-case.php">charges dropped</a> [JURIST report]. The State's Attorney for Baltimore City in May 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/baltimore-police-officers-indicted-in-freddie-gray-death.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the indictment of the police officers on charges including murder and manslaughter over the death Gray. Gray's arrest and death in April of last year led to widespread protests and civil disorder in the city of Baltimore. In September Baltimore reached a tentative agreement with Gray's family to <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/baltimore-reaches-tentative-64-million-settlement-in-freddie-gray-case.php">pay $6.4 million in settlement</a> [JURIST report]. In April of last year Amnesty International urged Baltimore police to <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/ai-baltimore-police-must-use-restraint-with-protestors.php">exercise restraint</a> [JURIST report] during protests, prioritize non-violent means and limit the use of force.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former prime minister <a href="http://en.bnpbangladesh.com/category/khaleda-zia/">Khaleda Zia</a> [official profile] in 10 pending cases, allowing her to go free. Zia, the head of the main opposition <a href="http://en.bnpbangladesh.com/">Bangladesh Nationalist Party</a> (BNP) [party website], is facing charges including arson for anti-government protests that turned violent. Zia also faces sedition charges for questioning the official death toll in the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. Zia claims that the charges are <a href="http://en.bnpbangladesh.com/2016/08/11/begum-zia-gets-bail-in-ten-cases/">politically motivated</a> [BNP press release] and designed to keep her from running in the next election, expected to take place in 2019. </p>

<p>Zia surrendered in April to a court after an arrest warrant was issued against her in connection with the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/02/fire-bomb-attacks-leave-dead-bangladesh-150208043255263.html">firebombing bus attack</a> [Al Jazeera report] last year staged in opposition of the government. In January Zia was <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/former-bangladesh-prime-minister-ordered-to-appear-in-court-following-sedition-charges.php">ordered to appear in court</a> [JURIST report] following charges of sedition. In May 2008 Bangladesh's <a href="http://www.acc.org.bd/">Anti-Corruption Commission</a> (ACC) [official website] filed formal charges against Zia for an alleged kickback scheme that awarded lucrative gas contracts to Canadian oil company Niko Resources Ltd. In March 2014 the former prime minister and other members of the BNP <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/former-bangladesh-pm-charged-with-corruption.php">were indicted</a> [JURIST report] on two corruption charges, accused of embezzling funds from a charitable trust named after Zia's deceased husband. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.belizejudiciary.org/web/supreme-court/">Belize Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday struck down a law banning sodomy, declaring it unconstitutional. Section 53 of the Belize Criminal Code banned "carnal intercourse against the order of nature." The law was challenged in 2010 by Caleb Orozco, whose organization, <a href="http://unibam.org/">UniBAM</a> [advocacy website], <a href="https://twitter.com/UNIBAMSupport/status/763429914431332352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">reported the ruling on Twitter</a> [Tweet]. Section 53 had been law in Belize since colonial times, and Belize is the first Caribbean nation where such a law has been declared unconstitutional. The court has not yet published a copy of the judgment. </p>

<p>The lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender community (LGBT) continues to face legal challenges throughout the world. Last December voters in Slovenia <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/slovenia-voters-reject-same-sex-marriage-law.php">rejected a law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. In November the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples can legally adopt children. The UN has become increasingly focused on the rights of LGBT individuals. In September 2015, 12 UN agencies <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">released a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] arguing that abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole. In June 2015 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-office-reports-continued-lgbt-discrimination.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maldives President Yameen Abdul Gayoom on Thursday signed into law a controversial bill criminalizing defamation with fines and jail terms despite widespread criticism. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ISSUES/FREEDOMOPINION/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx">UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression</a> [official website] David Kaye <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20359&LangID=E">issued a warning</a>  [press release] Wednesday condemning the bill approved by the Maldives parliament. Kaye cautioned that the "Protection of Reputation and Good Name and Freedom of Expression Bill" has the potential to limit exercise of free expression to the degree that the right is eliminated altogether, especially due to the vague wording of the bill. The bill criminalizes statements or comments deemed defamatory against "any tenet of Islam," or that "threaten national security" or to "contradict general social norms," and violation can elicit fines and jail time of up to six months. </p>

<p>Bills limiting freedom of expression and punishing religious dissension have been widespread across the world and have led to international concern. Earlier this year, a sharia high court in Nigeria <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/nigerian-shariah-court-sentences-10-to-death-for-blasphemy.php">sentenced cleric Abdulaziz Dauda and nine others to death</a> [JURIST report] by hanging for committing blasphemy against the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. In January UN human rights experts called for a review of the UK's draft "Investigatory Powers" bill fearing that the present draft of the bill could <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-experts-warn-uk-bill-could-threaten-freedom-of-expression.php">threaten freedom of expression and association</a> [JURIST report]. In February a Pakistani man was executed for his part in <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/pakistan-top-court-upholds-death-sentence-in-blasphemy-killing.php">murdering a politician</a> [JURIST report] who supported a Christian who had been convicted of blasphemy. Later that month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged the Indonesian Parliament to reject proposed amendments to its law on the "eradication of terrorism" [Law No. 15/2003]. HRW asserts that the <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/hrw-proposed-amendments-to-indonesia-terror-law-threaten-human-rights.php">proposed amendments are too vague</a> [JURIST report] and would limit the exercise of free expression and directly conflict with Indonesia's obligations to international human rights, leading to fundamental rights violations. And in 2010 HRW urged the <a href="/paperchase/2010/11/hrw-urges-repeal-of-pakistan-blasphemy-laws.php">repeal of all such laws</a> [JURST report].       </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US Senator on Wednesday released a <a href="https://www.ayotte.senate.gov/files/documents/Guantanamo%20Detainee%20Transparency%20Report.pdf">Pentagon Report</a> [official report, PDF] detailing the profiles of those currently detained in and recently released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) concluded that closing the facility would not be in the US' best interests and would pose a safety risk. About the report, Ayotte <a href="https://www.ayotte.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=2756">said</a> [press release] the more "Americans understand about the terrorist activities and affiliations of these detainees, the more they will oppose the administration's terribly misguided plans to release them." The report was compiled to highlight the terrorist background of many of the inmates and as a response to President Barack Obama's push to fulfill his promise to close the facility before the end of his term.   </p>

<p>White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told Fox News in January that Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/white-house-official-obama-plans-to-close-guantanamo-before-leaving-office.php">intends to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] his promise to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility before leaving office. There have been <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/oman-accepts-10-yemeni-prisoners-released-from-guantanamo-bay.php">multiple detainees released</a> from Guantanamo recently. Last November the <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">US Senate passed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr1735/BILLS-114hr1735enr.pdf">National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016</a> (NDAA) [text, PDF], which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The NDAA comes after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">Department of Defense said</a> [JURIST report] they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the facility in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force (GRTF) was created in response to a <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-27/pdf/E9-1893.pdf">2009 presidential executive order</a> [text, PDF] to review the status of all detainees. In September White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest said Obama was considering a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/wh-spokesperson-obama-still-considering-options-to-close-guantanamo.php">"wide array" of options</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Swiss Federal Tribunal on Thursday rejected an appeal by Israel, ordering Iran to be paid approximately USD $1.1 billion in a decades-old dispute over the Eliat-Ashkelon Pipeline. Switzerland's highest court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-israel-court-idUSKCN10M12F">rejected</a> [Reuters report] Israel's appeal for lack of due process, and also awarded close to USD $460,000 in court costs and lawyers fees. Despite the ruling, it is uncertain whether Israel will actually acquiesce to the court order. Israel's "Trading with the Enemy" law could be a potential stumbling block to Iran receiving its court mandated award. The <a href="http://eapc.com/">Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co.</a> (EAPC) [corporate website] was a joint venture between the two countries set up in 1968 to transport Iranian oil to Europe, primarily the Mediterranean. Following the Iranian Revolution, however, the relationship collapsed and Iran began seeking its share of revenues and assets from the EAPC through arbitration beginning in 1994.</p>

<p>This order marks a victory for Iran at a time when the country has faced heightened international scrutiny for its nuclear program. Iranian leaders have repeatedly <a href="/paperchase/2006/08/iran-says-it-will-continue-to-expand.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that the developing nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the international community, Israel in particular, worries that Iran's enrichment program was designed for military purposes. The US and France <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/us-and-france-want-stronger-nuclear-talks-with-iran.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in March to strengthen nuclear talks with Iran to persuade the nation to restrain its nuclear program in exchange for relief from sanctions and in April Iran <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/iran-agrees-to-framework-of-nuclear-deal.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to a framework deal to restrict its nuclear plan. Developments in this regard were largely positive and resulted in subtle improvement in ties between the US and Iran. A report obtained by the Associated Press in July from the<a href="https://www.iaea.org/"> UN International Atomic Energy Agency</a> (IAEA) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/iaea-iran-keeping-nuclear-commitments.php">showed</a> [JURIST report] that Iran has been keeping its commitment as part of a preliminary nuclear deal from 2013 barring Iran from expanding nuclear programs during negotiations. The Iranian Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/post-1.php">accepted</a> [JURIST report] the nuclear agreement in October and moved the process on to the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/middle_east/03/iran_power/html/guardian_council.stm">Guardian Council</a> [BBC backgrounder], which <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-nuclear-deal-approval-final-step/27306357.html">determined</a> [FRE/RL report] the legislation was consistent with the constitution and Islamic law. And as little two days ago, Iran <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/us-releases-iranian-prisoners-in-order-to-free-us-prisoners-in-iran.php">agreed to release</a> [JURIST report] four US citizens in exchange for seven Iranians being held in the US for violating former US sanctions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called upon Ethiopia Wednesday to allow international visitors into the region where 90 protesters were shot and killed by security forces this past weekend. Saying the excessive use of force in the Oromiya and Amhara regions needs to be investigated, the high commissioner <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-violence-un-idUSKCN10L1SY">expressed concern</a> [Reuters report] that there has been little, if any, "genuine attempt at investigation and accountability." A necessary consequence to investigating the recent violence, Zeid asked "the government to allow access for international observers into the Amhara and Oromiya regions so that we can establish what has happened" and further encourage security forces to abstain from using excessive force. Zeid also called for the release of all protesters. This most recent attack on peaceful, anti-government protesters comes less than two months after <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported that more than <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/hrw-more-than-400-killed-in-ethiopia-to-quell-oromia-protests.php">400 citizens have been killed</a> [JURIST report] by Ethiopian security forces since November.</p>

<p>In January several Ethiopian rights groups called on the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ethiopia-rights-groups-urge-international-community-to-address-protester-deaths.php">international community to address the killing</a> [JURIST report] of protesters. In December HRW reported that activists had witnessed <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/18/ethiopia-lethal-force-against-protesters">security forces firing into throngs of protesters</a> [HRW report]. That report came a day after Ethiopian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13349400">Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/addis-ababa-master-plan-protests-hailemariam-desalegn-warns-merciless-action-will-be-used-1533790">warned</a> [IBT report] of "merciless legitimate action against any force bent on destabilising the area." Ethiopian officials have been claiming that the demonstrations are a front for those involved in the protests to insight violence and threaten the stability of the nation. Ethiopia has used its broad anti-terrorism laws to detain political opposition before. In October five Ethiopian bloggers were <a href="http://zone9ethio.blogspot.com/">acquitted of terrorism charges</a> [Zone9, in Amharic] relating to publications on their website. The publications, critical of the government, landed <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/ethiopian-zone-9-bloggers-acquitted.php">nine bloggers in jail</a> [JURIST report], and one charged in absentia, in April 2014 for violation of the laws. That same month UN Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx">Ben Emmerson</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16653&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] over the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-warns-of-counter-terrorism-measures-used-to-public-interest-groups.php">rising use of counter-terrorism measures</a> [JURIST report] around the world. Many nations have used counter-terrorism as an excuse to restrict public assembly and stop the activities of public interest groups, Emmerson said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> [website] on Thursday approved the controversial <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1470910659_707.pdf">Electronic Crimes Bill 2015</a> [text, PDF].  The law has received <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/08/joint-statement-prevention-electronic-crimes-bill-2015-pakistan">negative attention</a> [HRW press release] in the past from human rights activists for the role it could play in hindering the free speech and privacy of Pakistani citizens. Particularly, activists warn about the broad and vague language contained in the Act which gives officials unqualified discretion to block and remove information. The bill was designed to help the Pakistan government combat terrorism and other cyber crimes.</p>

<p>Balancing the prevention of cyber crime while maintaining human rights has become a challenge for nations across the globe. In June China announced that <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-implements-new-internet-regulations-for-search-companies.php">search companies must abide by internet regulations</a> [JURIST report] in line with national interests and must clearly distinguish normal results from paid ads which may display illegal and misleading information. In March <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website]<a href="/paperchase/2016/03/amnesty-condemns-saudi-of-5-years-for-tweets.php"> expressed concern </a>[JURIST report] over the conviction of journalist Alaa Brinji in Saudi Arabia on charges of violating Article 6 of the Anti-Cyber Crime Law. All of the charges are based on tweets by the journalist expressing opposition views. In January tech companies Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo submitted evidence of possible conflicts that may arise from the UK government's proposed <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/473770/Draft_Investigatory_Powers_Bill.pdf">Investigatory Powers Bill</a> [text, PDF]. Should the bill pass, tech companies would be <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/us-tech-companies-express-opposition-to-uk-digital-surveillance-law.php">required to perform bulk data collections</a> [JURIST report] of all user activity within a 12-month period in order to help prevent terrorism, cyber bullying, and organized crime. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a statement released on Thursday, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20365&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] over Bulgaria's criminalization of migrants leaving and entering the country. Zeid stated Bulgaria's practice of arresting migrants for both entering and leaving Bulgaria irregularly "places many of them in an invidious Catch-22 situation" and calls into question the country's compliance with international law. While Zeid stated he and his team were pleased with the positive steps the country has taken in integrating international asylum standards, he is upset with the country's practice of arresting migrants who do not fall within the category of refugee, despite having "legitimate reasons for being unable to return to their home country." The high commissioner was particularly displeased with the "disregard for due process and fair trial guarantees." Finally, Zeid stated that he was worried the current detention regime will continue to expand, and called for leadership to create a pro-human rights environment for these migrants and put an end to intolerance.</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. Last week the ECJ ruled that non-EU immigrants who illegally enter the Schengen area across an internal border <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-of-justice-holds-that-immigrants-that-illegally-cross-schengen-area-cannot-be-imprisoned-so.php">should not be jailed</a> [JURIST report] solely on that basis. In March the ECJ ruled that Germany may place <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-court-rules-germany-can-require-refugees-to-live-in-certain-places.php">"residence conditions"</a> [JURIST report] on refugees. In February the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that new measures put in place by many European countries are too restrictive and <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-europe-placing-undue-hardships-on-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.php">place undue hardships</a> [JURIST report] on refugees and asylum-seekers. Also in February Amnesty International warned Austria that they are violating human rights through their daily <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-austria-cap-on-asylum-seekers-violates-human-rights.php">cap on asylum applications</a> [JURIST report]. In January Danish lawmakers approved a controversial bill that will allow Danish authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/denmark-lawmakers-approve-seizure-of-asylum-seekers-assets.php">seize assets</a> [JURIST report] from immigrants seeking asylum in order to cover their expenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several pastors in Illinois <a href="https://issuu.com/mauckbaker/docs/001_complaint">sued the state</a> [complaint] Thursday claiming its ban on the practice of gay conversion therapy on minors violates free speech and religious rights. Illinois is one of five state in the nation to ban such practices, a legal implementation <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/white-house-supports-banning-sexual-orientation-conversion-therapy.php">supported by President Barack Obama</a> [JURIST report]. The Illinois law, <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=HB&DocNum=217&GAID=13&SessionID=88&LegID=83875">The Youth Mental Health Protection Act</a> [materials], prohibits pastors from portraying homosexuality as a mental disorder in relation to sexual orientation change efforts. The law also bans therapists and counselors from trying to change the sexual orientation of minors. The practice of gay conversion therapy has been criticized as "scientifically questionable."</p>

<p>In 2015 Illinois <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Governor Bruce Rauner</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/illinois-governor-signs-law-banning-gay-conversion-therapy-for-minors.php">signed the Youth Mental Health Protection Act  into law</a> [JURIST report]. State Senator <a href="http://senatorbiss.com/">Daniel Biss</a> [official website], one of the sponsors of the legislation, released a <a href="http://senatorbiss.com/14-aca/news/138-protecting-children-from-harmful-therapy-practices">statement</a> [statement] calling the bill an important step in protecting young people and explained that many medical professionals believe conversion therapy can cause depression and risk of suicide. The bill became effective on January 1, making Illinois the fourth state after California, Oregon and New Jersey to ban similar therapy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.dea.gov/index.shtml">Drug Enforcement Agency</a> (DEA) [official website] <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2016-17960.pdf">denied requests</a> [responses, PDF] Thursday to remove marijuana's classification as a dangerous drug. The DEA denied two separate requests by former state governors to re-classify marijuana as a Schedule II drug or lower, saying "HHS concluded that marijuana has high potential for abuse, has no accepted medical use in the United States, and lacks an acceptable level of safety for use even under medical supervision." Despite refusing to reclassify marijuana, the DEA did propose a new policy that would allow universities, public and private, to apply to grow marijuana for research. Until now, the University of Mississippi had a monopoly on growing and studying the drug. This decision has major implications for dispensaries and marijuana growers in states that have legalized marijuana in some form, making them potentially culpable under federal law. This decision has already <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-marijuana-idUSKCN10M1IV">drawn ire</a> [Reuters report] from some including US Representative Earl Blumenauer who said "patients and marijuana businesses trapped between state and federal laws."</p>

<p>In April Pennsylvania's governor <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/pennsylvania-governor-establishes-statewide-medical-marijuana-program.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing medical marijuana. In February the Utah Senate <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/utah-senate-advances-bill-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">voted to advance a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would legalize the use of medical marijuana in various forms such as vapor or edible form. In December Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/colombia-president-signs-decree-legalizing-medical-marijuana.php">signed a decree</a> [JURIST report] fully legalizing medical marijuana in the country. Last November New York Governor Andrew Cuomo <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-york-governor-signs-emergency-medical-marijuana-bills.php">signed two bills</a> [JURIST report] in order to expedite the distribution of medical marijuana to citizens with critical health conditions. Earlier that month New Jersey Governor Chris Christie <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-jersey-governor-signs-bill-allowing-medical-marijuana-on-school-grounds-for-disabled-students.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law that would allow for the administering of edible medical marijuana to sick and disabled children on school grounds without triggering the arrests of parents or educators. In June of last year the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a law <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-of-canada-lifts-ban-on-alternative-forms-of-medical-marijuana.php">restricting the use of medical marijuana was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four South Carolina students and a non-profit filed a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/kenny_v_wilson_complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.scd.uscourts.gov/default.asp">US District Court for the District of South Carolina</a> [official website] Thursday challenging the state's <a href="http://lwvcharleston.org/files/spp_disturbing_schools_act.pdf">"Disturbing Schools Law"</a> [text, PDF]. The plaintiffs are challenging the law, which makes it illegal to "disturb in any way or in any place the students or teachers" or "act in an obnoxious manner," arguing that the statute is unconstitutionally broad and its enforcement is arbitrary and discriminatory, primarily against African American students. Three of the four students were African Americans. One of the students, 18-year-old Niya Kennedy, was filmed being thrown to the ground, dragged and arrested for violating this statute, leading to the officer's arrest and bringing the issue to a national stage. Violating the statute results in a misdemeanor charge with the potential for a $1,000 fine or 90 days in jail.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w3T5yVBz5j4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>This lawsuit addresses the "school-to-prison pipeline" wherein students, primarily minorities, are taken out of schools and put into prison, making them more likely to end up in prison in the future. In August of last year, two children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other special needs were <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/sr-v-kenton-county-sheriffs-office">handcuffed</a>  [ACLU backgrounder] with their arms behind their backs for behavior related to their disabilities. Both children were minorities&#8212;one Latino and one African American. Another African American student, 15-year-old Kyle Thompson, got into "a playful tug-of-war over a note" with his teacher, but handed the note over once he realized it was not playful. Michigan, where Thompson lives, has a 'zero-tolerance' policy and so Kyle was <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/brown-v-board-students-criminalized">handcuffed, put on house arrest, and expelled</a> [MSNBC report] from all state public schools for a year. Statistics also show that African Americans are harmed by this school-to-prison pipeline at a rate three times greater than white students, despite African American students making up only 16 percent of all those enrolled at public schools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.nj2as.org/">New Jersey Second Amendment Society</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/NJ2ndAmend.pdf">filed</a> [complaint, PDF] a lawsuit on behalf of a New Jersey man, Mark Cheesman, against the state's <a href="http://www.nj.gov/oag/">Attorney General</a> [official website] in the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website] on Thursday alleging the state's stun gun ban is unconstitutional. The complaint relies upon the Supreme Court's ruling in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/caetano-v-massachusetts/">Caetano v. Massachusetts</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] where the court held that prohibiting the possession of stun guns contradicts earlier Supreme Court rulings. Cheesman had tried to obtain a taser on Wednesday, but the company refused to sell to him due to the city's ban. This lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/gun-rights-advocates-challenge-dc-stun-gun-ban-in-second-amendment-suit/2016/08/03/381f61f4-5998-11e6-9767-f6c947fd0cb8_story.html">similar lawsuit</a> [WP report] challenging the stun gun ban in Washington DC.</p>

<p><a href="/feature/featured/concealed-and-open-carry-under-the-second-amendment/">Gun control</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. In May the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Second Amendment protects the <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-second-amendment-protects-right-to-buy-and-sell-guns.php">right to buy and sell guns</a> [JURIST report]. In January US President Barack Obama announced <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/obama-announces-executive-actions-on-gun-control.php">executive actions on gun control</a> [JURIST report]. In November an appellate court in Wisconsin ruled that a state law that <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/wisconsin-court-rules-second-amendment-protection-extends-to-knives.php">prohibits possession of certain knives</a> [JURIST report] violates the Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amnesty International said Thursday that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could amount to a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/08/syria-fresh-chemical-attack-on-aleppo-a-war-crime/">war crime</a> [press release]. The BBC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/11/syria-suspected-chlorine-gas-attack-in-aleppo-kills-woman-and-two-children">reported</a> [BBC report] Thursday that the Syrian government is suspected of using a chlorine gas attack in Aleppo, killing several and injuring many more. It is believed that the chlorine was dropped in a barrel bomb and global body's experts have been confirmed to be investigating the matter. According to the UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura, if the reports of the chlorine bomb are true, "it is a war crime," and she emphasized the need to "address [the problem] immediately." In response, Russia announced they would cease fire for several hours on Thursday in order to allow aid. However, witnesses in Aleppo claim there was no ceasefire. Chlorine gas results in severe respiratory issues, including asphyxiation, and is also very harmful to the eyes and skin.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10338256">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war based around the legitimacy of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10338256">President Bashar al-Assad</a> [BBC reports]. Last month <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. Last month UN human rights experts called for the immediate <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians. In May <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that armed opposition groups in Syria are committing war crimes around the Sheikh Maqsoud district of Aleppo city. Earlier that month top UN official Stephen O'Brien called for the immediate investigation of recent airstrikes in Syria, which may amount to war crimes for <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-official-syria-airstrikes-may-amount-to-war-crime.php">intentionally targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spokesperson for the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20368&LangID=E">reiterated previous calls</a> [press release] to Australia Friday to end offshore detention on Nauru. The press release notes various reports of violence, sexual assault, degrading treatment, and self-harm, revealed through more than 1,000 incident reports. The OHCHR also discussed signs of severe mental health issues which they believe stem from the poor treatment and prolonged detention of the migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees in Nauru. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani expressed disappointment that, despite numerous visits from and reports by OHCHR officers, the governments of Nauru and Australia have yet to address these serious issues. The press release urged both governments to properly investigate the allegations and ensure those responsible are held accountable. OHCHR ended by asking that the countries "expeditiously end the immigration detention of children," and institute human rights-compliant alternatives, also asking Nauru to establish a national mechanism to prevent this sort of torture.</p>

<p>Australian refugees and their treatment have been a topic of discussion among international human rights organizations as of late. Last week Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-ignoring-inhumane-treatment-of-refugees-to-deter-others-report.php">issued reports</a> [JURIST report] stating Australia is ignoring inhumane treatment for detainees in Nauru. In May the Papua New Guinea officials stated Australian refugees are <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/papua-new-guinea-announces-end-of-detainment-of-manus-island-asylum-seekers.php">not being detained</a> [JURIST report], as they are given access to mainland Australia, although refugee advocates believe that the refugees are being faced with arbitrary restrictions to the mainland. The statement by officials followed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/papua-new-guinea-top-court-rules-australia-offshore-detention-facility-illegal.php">ruling</a> by the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court that the Australian off-shore detention facility was illegal, in direct opposition to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/australia-high-court-rules-offshore-detention-policy-legal.php">ruling</a> [JURIST reports] by the Australian Supreme Court earlier this year that the off-shore detention was legal. In February the UN Human Rights Committee <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-experts-find-australia-violated-rights-of-former-guantanamo-detainee.php">issued a report</a> [JURIST report] in which it stated Australia had violated the rights of Guantanamo detainee David Hicks, continuing to detain him after his transfer from the United States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://eng.ftc.go.kr/">Korea Fair Trade Commission</a> (KFTC) [official website], South Korea's antitrust regulator, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/59bd6b78-6044-11e6-b38c-7b39cbb1138a.html#axzz4H9POZCfs">confirmed</a> [FT report] on Friday that the country is investigating whether <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/company/">Google</a> [corporate website] violated the country's antitrust laws. The KFTC's statement comes as a surprise as a local news outlet reported that the KFTC had cleared Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, of all antitrust claims against the technology giant. It is alleged that Google requires mobile-phone producers to pre-load the company's apps on phones using its Android operating system. Earlier this year, the EU Commissioner of Competition, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/vestager_en">Margeth Vestagar</a> [official profile], <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/eu-launches-antittrust-probe-into-google-relationship-with-android-developers.php">launched a probe</a> [JURIST report] in regards to the same matter.</p>

<p>Google has faced numerous legal suits both in the US and internationally. In 2015 the <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/google-rejects-eu-antitrust-claim-refuses-to-change-search-results.php">EU filed an antitrust claim</a> [JURIST report] against Google claiming that Google structures its search results to favor its own services over those of rivals. Earlier that year, privacy software company <a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a> [corporate website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/privacy-software-company-files-eu-antitrust-complaint-against-google.php">filed antitrust charges</a> [JURIST report] against Google with the European Commissioner. That January a representative for Google <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/01/google-to-rewrite-privacy-policy-in-response-to-uk-pressure.php">signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to rewrite the company's current privacy policy in response to pressure from the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">UK Information Commissioner's Office</a> [official website]. Also in January of last year Google was among four tech companies that reached a <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/apple-google-settle-415-million-class-action-lawsuit.php">$415 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a class action lawsuit claiming the companies unlawfully agreed to reduce employee compensation and mobility. A <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/china-executive-permitted-to-sue-google-over-autocomplete.php">Hong Kong court ruled</a> [JURIST report] in August 2014 that Chinese businessman Dr. Albert Yeung Sau Shing may continue his defamation suit against Google over the autocomplete function of the company's search engine, which suggests links connecting Yeung to organized crime groups in China. The <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/federal-appeals-court-rules-for-oracle-in-dispute-with-google.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in May 2014 that programming interfaces in Oracle's Java technology can be protected under US copyright law, allowing Oracle to pursue its legal case against Google.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Venezuelan appeals court in Caracas on Friday upheld the more than 13-year sentence of opposition leader Leopoldo López. The <a href="http://www.eluniversal.com/noticias/politica/corte-apelaciones-ratifico-condena-leopoldo-lopez_431543">sentencing</a> [El Universal report, in Spanish] of the Corte de Apelaciones del <a href="http://www.tsj.gob.ve">Tribunal Supremo de Justicia</a> (TSJ) [official website, in Spanish] can and will be <a href="http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/08/13/america/1471047016_895409.html">appealed</a> [El Pais report, in Spanish] to the country's highest court, and the legal team has resorted to <a href="http://aa.com.tr/en/americas/venezuelan-top-court-upholds-sentence-for-opp-leader/627769">appeal</a> [Anadolu Agency report] to international organizations. Amnesty International UK (AIUK) this week created a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/free-venezuela-opposition-leader-leopoldo-lopez">petition</a> [AIUK backgrounder] to put pressure on President Nicolas Maduro's regime to free López and an international campaign, <a href="http://www.freeleopoldo.com">Free Leopoldo</a> [advocacy website], has continued to urge for his immediate release.</p>

<p>The tension between the executive, legislative and judiciary branches of government in Venezuela has served as a hostile condition against López. In March Venezuela's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-legislature-passes-an-amnesty-for-dozen-of-jailed-dissidents.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amnesty law that would free 77 individuals allegedly jailed for political reasons under a number of crimes, including López, but Maduro has vowed to veto the law. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-chief-urges-protection-for-venezuela-opposition-after-assassination.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the protection of political opposition leaders associated with an assassinated Venezuelan opposition leader while he was on state with López's wife, Lilian Tintori. In October, a former Caracas prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/venezuela-prosecutor-opposition-leader-convicted-on-false-evidence.php">confessed</a> [JURIST report] to being pressured into presenting false evidence to condemn opposition leader López.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.ohsd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="/paperchase/Planned-Parenthood-Injunction.pdf">blocked</a> [order, PDF] the diversion of public funds from Planned Parenthood clinics across Ohio. Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood of the Southwest Ohio Region filed motions for permanent injunction and a judgment on the merits to prevent the enforcement of Ohio Revised Code Section 3701.34, which would have precluded the distribution of federal funds from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) to any entity that performs or promotes non-therapeutic abortions. Plaintiffs <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2016/08/13/Judge-blocks-Ohio-s-attempt-to-divert-Planned-Parenthood-funding/stories/201608130082">operate only three clinics</a> [<em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em> report] providing abortion services in Ohio, and have received federal funds from ODH for a number of years passing all state and local audits and program reviews. Acknowledging the state's argument that the legislature has "wide latitude in choosing among competing demands for limited public funds," Judge Michael Barrett stated that "this wide latitude to set spending priorities exists '[s]o long as legislation does not infringe on other constitutionally protected rights.'" Ohio's <a href="http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/About-AG/Mike-Dewine">Attorney General Mike DeWine</a> [official website] plans to appeal the decision. </p>

<p>Abortion in general continues to be a highly controversial subject in the US. Last month the <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/ctinfo.htm">Alaska Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/alaska-supreme-court-rejects-parental-consent-requirement-for-under-18-abortions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's parental "notification law" requiring doctors to inform the parents of minors seeking an abortion is unconstitutional, and cannot be enforced. Earlier the same month a US district judge issued a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-blocks-florida-efforts-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against a law intended to cut state funding to clinics administering abortions. Also in July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-federal-court-blocks-state-abortion-bill.php">placed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on an Indiana law that would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. Recently the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">Texas law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The primary challenger to incumbent Zambian President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14112922">Edgar Lungu</a> [BBC profile], <a href="http://hh-zambia.com">Hakainde Hichilema</a> [official website], on Saturday <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3736459/Zambian-presidential-challenger-claims-election-fraud.html">accused</a> [<em>Daily Mail</em> report] the country's electoral commission of colluding with the Patriotic Front (PF), the ruling party, to manipulate the results of the election. Hichilema, who represents the United Party for National Development (UPND), alleged that the Electoral Commission is delaying results to create fake results. At least three people have been killed during the campaign so far, as a result of regular clashes between PF and UPND activists in a country that is generally known for its relative stability and historical record of peaceful elections. Hichilema urged his own supporters to be peaceful. Results of the election were expected to be announced on Friday, but there have been repetitive delays in a scheduled briefing leaving the voters anxious. This is <a href="http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/Zambia-awaits-vote-result-as-opposition-claims-fraud/2016/08/13/article3577810.ece">not the first time</a> [The New Indian Express report] that Hichilema alleged electoral fraud. Constitutional changes since a 2015 snap ballot, in which <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/zambia-elects-new-president.php">Hichilema lost to Lungu by a narrow margin</a> [JURIST report], mean that a candidate must now secure more than 50 percent of the vote to be declared victorious. Esau Chulu, the chairman of the ECZ called the claims unsubstantiated. According to Chulu, results are currently <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-zambia-election-idUKKCN10N193">not expected</a> [Reuters report] until at least Sunday. </p>

<p>Zambia's presidency has been surrounded by controversy in recent years. In 2013 Zambian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zambia-authorities-arrest-former-president.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] former president Rupiah Banda on allegations that he misappropriated over USD $11 million during his three-year tenure in office. Zambia's Supreme Court in 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/zambia-high-court-acquits-ex-presidents-wife-on-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Regina Chiluba, the wife of former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba, of charges that she accepted stolen property during the years of her husband's administration. Prior to his wife's acquittal, former president <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/zambia-ex-president-acquitted-of.php">Chiluba was acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 of charges of stealing money from the country's treasury while in office from 1991-2001. He was ordered to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/former-zambia-president-to-stand-trial.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on the corruption charges in February 2008. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/BAEC4EEE781518DE8525800D0051C627/$file/15-5250-1630003.pdf">threw out</a> [opinion, PDF] a lawsuit by former Guantanamo detainee Mohammed Jawad claiming he was tortured. The appeals court affirmed the district court in refusing to hear the merits of the case because of the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109s3930enr/pdf/BILLS-109s3930enr.pdf">Military Commissions Act of 2006</a> (MCA) [text, PDF], which removes the court's jurisdiction over cases arising from the detention of someone who was given enemy combatant status. Similar cases to Jawad's have also been thrown out based on the MCA.</p>

<p>A US Senator last week <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pentagon-report-discourages-guantanamo-closure.php">released a Pentagon Report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the profiles of those currently detained in and recently released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) concluded that closing the facility would not be in the US' best interests and would pose a safety risk. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told Fox News in January that US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/white-house-official-obama-plans-to-close-guantanamo-before-leaving-office.php">intends to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] his promise to close the Guantanamo detention facility before leaving office. There have been <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/oman-accepts-10-yemeni-prisoners-released-from-guantanamo-bay.php">multiple detainees released</a> [JURIST report] from Guantanamo recently. Last November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The NDAA comes after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">Department of Defense said</a> [JURIST report] they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the facility in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force (GRTF) was created in response to a 2009 presidential <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-27/pdf/E9-1893.pdf">executive order</a> [text, PDF] to review the status of all detainees. In September White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest said Obama was considering a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/wh-spokesperson-obama-still-considering-options-to-close-guantanamo.php">"wide array" of options</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Nice court on Saturday upheld a ban on full-body swimsuits, known as burkinis, in the southern French city of Cannes. The city's mayor <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37056742">imposed the ban</a> [BBC report] last month after authorities and surrounding residents criticized the full body swimsuits for being a symbol of "radical Islamism." Those found wearing burkinis could be fined €38 and would be required to either change their outfit or leave the beach. The court found the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37074601">ban</a> [BBC report] to be in line with French law that allows for prohibitions against actions that disregard public relations policies concerning religion. The <a href="http://www.islamophobie.net/">Collective Against Islamophobia in France</a> (CCIF) [official website, in French] has denounced the court's decision, stating that such a ban may allow prohibitions against all publicly displayed religious symbols. The CCIF's next move will be to appeal the decision to France's highest court. </p>

<p>Tensions in France have been high since an event in Nice last month in which more than 84 citizens were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">killed</a> [BBC report] by a truck that drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. The Islamic State (IS) has claimed <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-16/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-nice-attack/7635270">responsibility</a> [ABC News report] for the attack, which followed a call by IS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani for IS followers to kill non-believers in the West through any means possible. Four men believed to be connected to the attacked were <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/arrested-in-connection-with-nice-attack.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by authorities later in July. The Bastille Day attack is the second most deadly in a string of terrorist acts in France, including the November 13 Charlie Hebdo <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30717580">attacks</a> [BBC news archive], which claimed 130 lives, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36524094">murder</a> [BBC report] of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to IS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ahmed Bin Quasem and Humman Qader Chowdhury were arrested without warrants on August 9 and August 4, respectively. They were reportedly carried out by men in plain clothes who did not identify themselves as security forces. The men have also not been presented before a magistrate and have not had access to family or lawyers. Officials have denied having the men in custody, although many sources have said otherwise.</p>

<p>Both detained men are sons of opposition leaders who have been convicted of war crimes during the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury was <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-executes-opposition-leaders-for-war-crimes.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] last November. Mir Quasem Ali is also facing the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">death penalty</a> [JURIST report]. Rights groups such as AI have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by Bangladesh's war crimes tribunal, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Egypt's public prosecutor on Saturday issued an order for the arrest of 13 people accused of committing profiteering, forgery and embezzlement as part of a national wheat import scandal. Local suppliers have historically added wheat to their imported supplies to <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL8N1AU0DH">claim state subsidies</a> [Reuters report]. Egypt offers such subsidies to encourage wheat farming and maintain its status as the world's largest wheat importer. Investigators, however, have discovered that local suppliers and government employees have falsified 221,800 tons of imported wheat supplies, an amount worth approximately USD $69.93 million. The public prosecutor has ordered thus far that silo owners suspected of scandalous activity should be banned from travel and have their funds frozen. Later this month, the <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.eg/home/">Egyptian parliament's</a> [official website, in Arabic] investigation committee will release a report detailing their findings regarding the corrupt activity of concern. </p>

<p>Corruption remains a problem in Egyptian politics. In December Egypt's former Agriculture Minister was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-egypt-agriculture-minister-detained-for-courruption.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] after an investigation headed by the country's prosecutor revealed that the minister and others received bribes amounting to over USD $1 million. In July 2015 an Egyptian court sentenced former prime minister <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3881805.stm">Ahmed Nazif</a> [BBC backgrounder] to <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/egypt-court-sentences-former-prime-minister-to-five-years-in-prison.php">five years in prison</a> [JURIST report] during a retrial graft charges. Nazif served during the presidency of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12301713">Hosni Mubarak</a> [BBC profile] until the start of the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/01/201112515334871490.html">Egyptian Uprising</a> [Al Jazeera timeline] in 2011, and was convicted of using his position to make illicit gains in excess of 64 million Egyptian pounds, or approximately USD $8.2 million. In February 2015 the Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-clears-mubarak-officials-of-corruption.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Nazif and former minister of interior Habib el-Adly of all charges against them. Both defendants were charged with "squandering public funds and profiteering" after allegedly making an illegal deal with German Company UTSCH to sell license plates for higher than market value.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of independent UN human rights experts on Monday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20375&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [press release] over Bahrain's persecution of the Shia population. The experts said, "[t]he intensified wave of arrests, detentions, summons, interrogations and criminal charges brought against numerous Shia religious clerics and singers, human rights defenders and peaceful dissidents is having a chilling effect on fundamental human rights." They noted that Shias are being charged with illegal gathering, inciting hatred against the regime, money laundering and acts of terrorism and said, "[t]hese charges should not be used as a pretext to restrict the freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly and freedom of religion or belief." The experts called on the Bahrain government to end arbitrary arrests, release those detained and lift travel bans. The experts include Sètondji Adjovi, Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; David Kaye, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Heiner Bielefeldt, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; and Michel Forst, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Bahrain is considered an ally of the US but has faced growing international concerns about its human rights practices. Last month the Bahrain High Civil Court ordered al-Wefaq, the main Shiite opposition group in the country, to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/bahrain-high-court-orders-shiite-opposition-group-dissolved.php">dissolved</a> [JURIST report]. In June a UN human rights adviser called on Bahrain to <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-adviser-urges-bahrain-to-respect-freedom-of-assembly.php">ensure human rights are respected</a> [JURIST report] following protests triggered by the decision to strip Sheikh Issa Qassem, a prominent Shia religious leader, of his nationality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, David Kaye, <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20377&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] on Monday that the upcoming trial in Singapore of a teenage blogger is a sign of increased criminalization of expression. The trial is scheduled this week for a 17 year-old blogger who posted to Facebook content that allegedly "wounded the religious feelings of Muslims and Christians." If convicted at the trial in which he will defend himself, the teenager will face up to three years in jail. The UN Special Rapporteur asserted that the trial is contrary to international human rights law because (1) the trial concerns a lawful expression and (2) the teenager is considered a child under international human rights law. The UN expert expressed that "only serious and extreme instances of incitement to hatred" are to be prohibited as criminal offenses under international human rights law, even if the expression is disturbing, offensive or shocking.</p>

<p>Singapore has faced growing international concerns about its human rights practices. Last month JURIST guest columnist Stephen Cooper, former DC public defender, <a href="/hotline/2016/07/stephen-cooper-human-rights.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] with JURIST the harshness of the death penalty in California, Singapore and other places. In May Singapore police officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/malaysia-man-executed-in-singapore-after-appeals-exhausted.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the hanging death of a man allegedly complicit in the death of another. In July of last year a Singapore court <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/singapore-releases-16-year-old-blogger-jailed-for-obscenity.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a 16-year-old video blogger who had been jailed after posting images and videos insulting the country's first prime minister. In January 2015 a spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-office-urges-halt-drug-related-death-penalty-in-southeast-asia.php">voiced</a> [JURIST report] concern over the continued use of the death penalty in Southeast Asia as punishment for drug-related crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human rights victims of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos' regime petitioned the Philippine Supreme Court on Monday to permanently block the government's plan to bury him in the "Heroes Cemetery." The petitioners <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/08/15/philippine-court-asked-to-block-hero-burial-for-marcos.html">assert</a> [AP report] that the burial for the tyrant would be illegal, flout the constitution, violate regulations concerning the military-run cemetery and would violate a 1993 agreement to bury the dictator in his hometown in northern Ilocos Norte province. President Rodrigo Duterte <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/nation-world/world/article95598902.html">maintains</a> [AP report] that the late dictator qualifies for burial in the cemetery as a former soldier and president. Hundreds have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/14/filipinos-protest-ferdinand-marcos-heros-burial">protested</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the burial asserting that Marcos <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/08/15/the-corpse-of-philippine-strongman-ferdinand-marcos-may-finally-get-a-heros-burial/">collaborated</a> [WP report] with Japanese forces that occupied the Philippines during World War II, that approximately 3,240 people were killed under martial law imposed by him between 1972 and 1981, and other massive rights violations.</p>

<p>The effects of Marcos' regime have been felt in the Philippines. In 2013 JURIST guest columnist Lara Wharton, <a href="/dateline/2013/03/lara-wharton-philippines-compensation.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] human rights abuses in the Philippines. Also in that year, then-Philippines President Benigno Aquino III <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/philippines-president-signs-law-to-compensate-victims-of-martial-law-abuses.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] legislation to compensate the victims of human rights abuses committed 27 years ago under the regime of former president Marcos. In January 2013 the Philippines House of Representatives and Senate <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-legislature-ratifies-bill-granting-compensation-for-rights-abuses.php">ratified</a> the legislation to <a href="/paperchase/2013/01/philippines-congress-approves-bill-granting-compensation-to-human-rights-victims.php">compensate</a> [JURIST reports] approximately 10,000 victims. In 2012 the Philippine president <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/philippines-president-signs-law-criminalizing-enforced-disappearances.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] legislation that criminalized enforced disappearances by agents of the state, an allegedly common practice under Marcos. In April 2011 Imelda Marcos, Ferdinand Marcos' wife, was <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/philippines-court-orders-imelda-marcos-to-repay-stolen-state-funds.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] to return USD $280,000 in state funds stolen by the late dictator.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/915216/detainee-transfers-announced">announced the transfer</a> [press release] of 15 Guantanamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Twelve of the detainees were from Yemen, and the other three were from Afghanistan. Six of the detainees had been approved for release since 2009, and the others were cleared for release more recently. Thirteen of the detainees had never faced any charges, and two of the Afghan detainees had their military commission charges drops. This marks the largest single detainee transfer so far, as the Obama administration works toward its goal of shuttering the detention center. After these transfers, there are 61 detainees remaining at Guantanamo.</p>

<p>A US Senator last week <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pentagon-report-discourages-guantanamo-closure.php">released a Pentagon Report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the profiles of those currently detained in and recently released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) concluded that closing the facility would not be in the US' best interests and would pose a safety risk. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told Fox News in January that US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/white-house-official-obama-plans-to-close-guantanamo-before-leaving-office.php">intends to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] his promise to close the Guantanamo detention facility before leaving office. Last November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The NDAA comes after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">DOD said</a> [JURIST report] they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the facility in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 presidential <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-27/pdf/E9-1893.pdf">executive order</a> [text, PDF] to review the status of all detainees. In September White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest said Obama was considering a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/wh-spokesperson-obama-still-considering-options-to-close-guantanamo.php">"wide array" of options</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/Home/">Attorney General Kathleen Kane</a> [official website] announced her resignation Tuesday following a conviction on perjury and obstruction charges. Kane was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/jury-convicts-pennsylvania-attorney-general-of-perjury-obstruction-1471312231">convicted</a> [WSJ report] Monday on nine criminal charges, including two felony perjury charges that each carry seven-year prison terms. Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov">Governor Tom Wolf</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/08/gov_tom_wolf_kathleen_kanes_re.html">called</a> [PennLive report] the situation "unfortunate" but stated that "[h]er decision to resign is the right one, and will allow the people of Pennsylvania to finally move on from this situation." Kane's resignation will take effect at close of business on Wednesday. A sentencing hearing has not yet been scheduled.</p>

<p>Kane, 49, was elected in 2012, becoming the first Democrat and the first woman to become attorney general since the post became elective in 1980. In February Pennsylvania's Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/pa-high-court-refuses-to-reinstate-ag-kanes-law-license.php">refused</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Kane's law license while investigations proceeded into her alleged leak of grand jury materials. In August of 2015 prosecutors <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/pennsylvania-ag-charged-with-leaking-information.php">filed criminal charges</a> [JURIST report] against her for allegedly leaking grand jury documents to the media to embarrass a critic, and then giving false testimony to a grand jury to cover up her actions. In May 2015 a state judge appointed a Special Prosecutor to investigate allegations that statewide, confidential grand jury information may have been leaked to the media. After a seven-month investigation, the investigating grand jury recommended criminal charges against Kane. A <a href="http://montcopa.org/DocumentCenter/View/9515">criminal complaint</a> [text, PDF] had also been filed against one of Kane's aids. Kane previously refused to resign, claiming that a resignation would be an admission of guilt.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Navajo Nation on Tuesday <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3022143-2016-08-15-NN-Complaint-DRAFT.html">filed suit</a> [complaint] against the <a href="https://www3.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] alleging that water flowing from a punctured mine in Colorado was toxic and "damaged the Nation's environment, people, and economy." Specifically, the 48-page complaint alleges that the toxic wastewater contaminated the San Juan River, a river on which the Nation has a "[u]nique dependence," and the contamination negatively affected the production of crops, feeding of cattle, culture and economy of the Nation. The complaint also alleges that the operators of the mines hired by the EPA, Gold King Mines Corporation, "continuously neglected its obligations to control the discharge of wastewater from its properties and to operate the treatment facility to protect [their] water" and that the damages were "preventable and foreseeable."</p>

<p>This is the latest in a number of cases naming the EPA as a defendant. Earlier this year the state of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-mexico-lawsuit-epa-idUSKCN0YE2PJ">New Mexico filed suit</a> [Reuters report] against the EPA concerning the toxic wastewater from the Colorado punctured mine, and it is likely that Colorado and Utah will follow suit. In April residents of Flint, Michigan, represented by attorney Michael Pitt, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/flint-residents-sue-epa-over-lead-contaminated-water.php">filed an administrative complaint</a> [JURIST report] against the EPA for negligence in handling the Flint water crisis. The suit alleged that the EPA was notified of contamination in the Flint water supply long before acting in any substantive way to mitigate the harm or properly investigate the complaints. As a result of their inaction, the residents of Flint allege they were subjected to lead in their water supply for over a year causing physical injury to themselves and their property.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton <a href="http://www.minister.border.gov.au/peterdutton/Pages/MANUS-REGIONAL-PROCESSING-CENTRE.aspx">announced</a> [press release] Wednesday that the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea plan to close the controversial Manus Island detention center. Since 2012 Australia has sent asylum seekers to offshore detention centers where they have been subjected to inhumane treatment. Human rights groups have brought light to the physical and sexual <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-asylum-idUSKCN10S0QL">abuse</a> [Reuters report] faced by these individuals which has created pressure for reform. Although there has been an agreement to close the center, Australia has stated they refuse to accept the detainees held there. There is no time frame on the process which has led to skepticism. </p>

<p>Under the controversial policy, those who seek asylum in Australia arriving by boat are detained on the island nation of Nauru or on Manus Island. The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/papua-new-guinea-top-court-rules-australia-offshore-detention-facility-illegal.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in April that Australia's detention of asylum seekers on Manus Island in northern Papua New Guinea is illegal. The court found that the detention center violates Article 42 of Papua New Guinea's Constitution, which guarantees personal liberty. A group of more than 750 detainees held on Manus Island <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/manus-island-detainees-bring-legal-challenge-before-australia-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the Australian High Court in early May to order their transfer to mainland Australia and block a transfer to the detention center in the island nation of Nauru.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The High Commissioner emphasized the importance of access to the region after recent allegations of excessive force, state sponsorship of violence, as well as the number of people killed and injured.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Afghan security forces are occupying schools as part of military operations, contrary to several international declarations, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/08/17/education-front-lines/military-use-schools-afghanistans-baghlan-province">reported</a> [materials] Wednesday. The report details why such military seizures push civilians into the front lines, risks the lives of children and perpetuate a failing educational system in the nation. HRW also claims the Taliban is responsible for occupying numerous schools in the northeastern region of Afghanistan, leaving the buildings in rubble. The advocacy group urged the government to take immediate steps to curtail the use of schools in military efforts.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Afghanistan has faced criticism for putting its children and its educational system at risk. In July the <a href="https://unama.unmissions.org/">UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan</a> (UNAMA) [official website] reported that <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-reach-record-high-in-first-half-of-year.php">civilian casualties have reached a record high</a> [JURIST report] in the first half of 2016, with more than a third of that number accounting for children. In April the UN reported that violence in Afghanistan has injured health and education personnel, reducing available health care and <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-report-afghanistan-schools-and-hospitals-facing-increasing-violence.php">restricting children's' access to fundamental health and educational services</a> [JURIST report]. In August 2015 the UN reported a <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-report-rise-in-women-and-children-casualties-in-afghanistan.php">significant increase</a> [JURIST report] in the number of women and children being hurt or killed in Afghanistan's war against the Taliban and other insurgents. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.in">India branch of Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] temporarily closed its office Wednesday after the organization was accused of sedition and anti-India sentiments. The accusations arose after AI promoted a human rights seminar in Kashmir, focusing on alleged human rights abuses carried out by the Indian security forces. AI <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.in/show/news/amnesty-international-indias-response-to-complaint-filed-by-abvp/">responded</a> [press release] to the accusations by stating that "[the accusations] are preventing the families of victims of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir from having their stories heard. And preventing civil society organisations from enabling these families to exercise their constitutional right to justice." </p>

<p>Kashmir has been a subject of international concern for several month. Also Wednesday UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-urges-india-and-pakistan-to-grant-access-to-kashmir.php">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [JURIST report] expressed his <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20382&LangID=E">concerns</a> [press release] regarding Indian and Pakistani authorities refusing to allow the Human Rights Council access to Kashmir.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Deputy US Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/blog/phasing-out-our-use-private-prisons">announced</a> [official statement] Thursday that the <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] will phase out privately operated prisons. The report states the DOJ's intent to focus on the rehabilitative aspects of incarceration will be better both for society and the taxpayer, and outlines the ultimate goal of housing all federal inmates in bureau facilities. This memo was supported by the 2013 report <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2013/08/12/smart-on-crime.pdf">Smart on Crime</a> [official report, PDF] and was prompted by the expiration of a contract for 1,200 privately operated beds.          </p>

<p>The <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">treatment of prisoners and prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] have been matters of ongoing concern in the US. In March two groups in Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ohio-groups-recommend-criminal-justice-reform.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing recommendations for criminal justice reform in their state. Also in March the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">urged state court systems</a> [JURIST report] to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-resources-assist-state-and-local-reform-fine-and-fee-practices">profit off poor defendants</a> [press release]. In February the <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/california-supreme-court-rules-governor-can-move-forward-with-prison-overcrowding-ballot-measure.php">Supreme Court of California ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Governor Jerry Brown can put his plan to ease prison overcrowding on the ballot this November. In January the US Supreme Court ruled that a landmark decision banning mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-ruling-against-mandatory-juvenile-life-sentences-applies-retroactively.php">should apply retroactively</a> [JURIST report]. In May <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-us-prisons-using-excessive-force-on-mentally-disabled-prisoners.php">Human Rights Watch released</a> [JURIST report] a report stating that mentally disabled prisoners experience "unnecessary, excessive, and even malicious force" at the hands of prison staff across the US. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An <a href="http://www.oklahomacounty.org/">Oklahoma County</a> [official website] judge upheld a controversial <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/questions/746.pdf">voter identification law</a> [text, PDF] this week, allowing the law to be in place Thursday while <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_VOTER_ID_CHALLENGE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">early voting commenced</a> [AP report] for a primary run-off. The Oklahoma law requires citizens to provide valid photo ID before voting. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3022186-Voter-ID-Plaintiff-s-Trial-Brief.html">brief</a> [text, PDF] filed by the plaintiff in the suit alleged that the photo ID requirement would exclude more than half a million citizens from voting and would disproportionately impact vulnerable classes like minorities, the impoverished and the elderly.  The law does allow for the use of provisional ballots and the acceptance of voter registration cards. Primarily because of these two attributes the defendants in the case <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3022187-Voter-ID-Defendant-s-Trial-Brief.html">argued</a> [text, PDF] that the measure was "reasonable and not destructive to some constitutional right," and that the plaintiff could not meet her burden to prove otherwise. This lawsuit began in 2012 in a suit claiming the photo identification requirement infringed upon the right to vote and came before the District Court for Oklahoma County in 2016. Opposition to the law have compared the requirement to a poll tax, while supporters of the law claim it will reduce voting fraud. </p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in years with a presidential election. Earlier this month a federal court denied a motion by North Carolina officials to stay an earlier order <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-denies-motion-to-stay-ruling-on-north-carolina-voting-law.php">striking down the state's voter ID law</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that week a federal judge barred <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-judge-blocks-north-dakota-voter-id-law.php">North Dakota</a> [JURIST report] from enforcing its voter ID law. Last month voter restrictions were overturned not only in North Carolina, but in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports]. In June a federal judge ruled that Ohio's elimination of the state's <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">early in-person voting </a>[JURIST report] was unconstitutional and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter ID law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, is <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a bill that will <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mexico human rights watchdog: 22 civilians executed in suspected drug raid</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to a <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/doc/OtrosDocumentos/Doc_2016_021.pdf">report</a> [report, Spanish] issued by Mexico's independent <a href="http://www.cndh.org.mx/">National Human Rights Commission</a> [official website, Spanish], 22 civilians were executed during a May 2015 drug raid in Michoacan. The report states that among the 43 individuals killed during the drug-bust, including one police officer, 22 civilians died as a result of "arbitrary execution," and an additional four were killed from "excessive use of force." While Mexican authorities continue to say the civilians were killed during the gunfight, the human rights commission maintains that the deaths were a result of human rights violations, and said that police placed guns next to 16 bodies in an attempt to substantiate these false claims. The human rights watchdog also found that the Michoacan Attorney General's Office was at fault for mishandling the ballistics evidence. The country's National Security Commission <a href="http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=2419057&CategoryId=14091">continues to support</a> [LAHT report] the actions of the police, saying "[t]he the use of arms was necessary and the police acted...in legitimate defense."</p>

<p>Mexico has received criticism from multiple human rights organizations for its handling of human rights abuses, as forced disappearances and military violence have come to international attention. In May the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-urges-mexico-to-investigate-summary-executions.php">called upon</a> [JURIST report] Mexico to investigate human rights violations following the death of 22 people, including at least 12 summary executions. In April three UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-experts-urge-mexico-to-support-human-rights-defenders.php">pleaded</a> [JURIST report] with Mexican authorities to support human rights groups facing extreme criticism in the national media. In 2015 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/10/28/mexico-police-killings-michoacan">reported</a> [press release] that there is evidence of recent unlawful police killings in Mexico. The report suggested that police action which left eight civilians dead in the city of Apatzingán on January 6, and 42 civilians and one police officer dead in Tanhuato on May 22 was an "excessive use of force against unarmed civilians." That same year, the <a href="http://centroprodh.org.mx/en/">Miguel Agustin Pro human rights center</a> [official website] in Mexico announced that there is evidence that high-ranking Mexican officers gave soldiers orders to kill criminals prior to an army mass slaying of suspected cartel members in June 2014. In 2013 the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx">Christof Heyns</a> [official website], <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/un-rights-expert-to-increase-human-rights-protections-reduce-military-in-policing.php">urged Mexico's government</a> [JURIST report] to better protect against human rights abuses, specifically with respect to the military's use of force against civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal judge blocks Florida law defunding Planned Parenthood</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.flnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Florida</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="/paperchase/FLPlannedParenthood.pdf">permanently blocked</a> [order, PDF] portions of a Florida law that would stop funding to <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-south-east-north-florida">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website] following Governor Rick Scott's decision to not pursue further legal action. The judge, Robert Hinkle, had previously <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-blocks-florida-efforts-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">enjoined the law</a> [JURIST report] on June 30, and held the law harmed Planned Parenthood "based not on any objection to how the funds are being spent...but solely because the recipients of the funds choose to provide abortions separate and apart from any funding." The proposed law would have prevented any organization that provides abortions from receiving state or local funding, resulting in a loss of $500,000 according to Planned Parenthood officials. Scott and his lawyers could still potentially appeal the decision.</p>

<p>Abortion in general continues to be a highly controversial subject in the US. A federal court judge in Ohio <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-court-blocks-diversion-of-public-funds-from-planned-parenthood.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] similar legislation earlier this month. Last month the <a href="http://www.courts.alaska.gov/ctinfo.htm">Alaska Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/alaska-supreme-court-rejects-parental-consent-requirement-for-under-18-abortions.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's parental "notification law" requiring doctors to inform the parents of minors seeking an abortion is unconstitutional, and cannot be enforced. Also in July a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-federal-court-blocks-state-abortion-bill.php">placed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on an Indiana law that would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. Recently the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that a <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">Texas law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BKin/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">Angela Merkel</a>, through the <a href="https://www.bundestag.de/bundestag/abgeordnete18/biografien/M/maiziere_thomas/258800">Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere</a> [official profiles, in German], said on Friday that women should be banned from wearing a face veil in various areas, including in school and while driving. On the partial face veil ban, which is part of a larger security declaration presented by the regional interior ministers for Merkel's Christian Democrats and (CDU) the Christian Social Union (CSU), Maiziere <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-religion-burqa-germany-idUSKCN10U0V6">said</a> [Reuters report] the veils have no place in Germany society Though Merkel and other German conservatives have been open about wanting a face veil ban, Maiziere stated they were aware a full ban would not be allowed in the country's constitutional court. The statement is issued on the cusp of Germany's state elections and at a time where Merkel has lost significant public support over immigration. Those in opposition, including Social Democrat (SPD) Labour Minister Andrea Nahles, have said the calls show an "increasingly xenophobic" discourse within the country. Germany's population is comprised of only five percent of the population and very few women actually wear a burqa in the country.</p>

<p>Face veils and other symbols of religion have been a controversial subject around the world. Last month, the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/index_en">European Union's</a> [official website] highest court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/eu-court-backs-french-woman-dismissed-for-wearing-head-scarf.php">ruled in favor</a> [JURIST report] of a French woman who was fired for wearing a head scarf. Last year the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in favor of a Muslim woman who was <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-for-woman-denied-job-over-headscarf.php">denied a job</a> [JURIST report] at <a href="https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> [corporate website] because of her headscarf. In September a Canadian court ruled that women may be <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/canada-court-rules-women-may-wear-veil-during-citizenship-oath.php">allowed to wear</a> [JURIST report] face-covering veils while swearing the oath of citizenship after an individual sued the country because she was not allowed to take part in the ceremony. Also in 2015, after suicide bombings in Fotokol by two women wearing burkas, Northern Cameroon <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/women-banned-from-wearing-burkas-in-northern-cameroon-after-suicide-bombings.php">banned</a> [JURIST report] women from wearing burkas and face-covering veils as the bombs had been smuggled into public under veils. In July 2014 the European Court of Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/europe-rights-court-upholds-france-face-covering-ban.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that France's face covering ban is permissible under European law and complies with all articles of the Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and does not violate freedom of religion. In February 2013 the Spanish Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/spain-supreme-court-strikes-down-city-burqa-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a city ban on wearing veils over the face in municipal buildings, finding that the law infringes on religious freedom.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Poland to investigate head of Constitutional Tribunal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polish prosecutors said Thursday that they have begun an investigation into <a href="http://trybunal.gov.pl/en/">Constitutional Tribunal</a> [official website] head, Andrzej Rzeplinski, to determine if he abused his power in preventing judges appointed by the ruling party to take part in decisions. Likely the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/08/19/world/europe/ap-eu-poland-politics.html">investigation</a> [NYT report] is meant to discredit the judge, who is immune from prosecution by virtue of his position. The investigation is the most recent development in the fight between the ruling right-wing government, Law and Justice (PiS), and the Constitutional Tribunal, which operates much like the US Supreme Court, stemming from a incident before PiS came into power. In particular, PiS has been accused of illegally appointing three judges where the previous ruling party had already legally filled those positions.</p>

<p>PiS has drawn ire from those in the international community for threatening democracy in Poland. In June the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-warns-poland-over-constitutional-court-changes.php">issued a warning</a> to Poland over the appointment of the three judges. The European Union began <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/eu-initiates-rule-of-law-procedure-in-poland.php">examining</a> Poland's decision regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/poland-passes-controversial-law-to-weaken-top-court.php">Constitutional Court</a> [JURIST reports] in January. In February the Polish government passed a controversial <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/poland-president-approves-controversial-surveillance-law.php">surveillance law</a> [JURIST report] that <a href="http://www.prezydent.pl/aktualnosci/wydarzenia/art,116,prezydent-podpisal-o-ustawe-o-zmianie-ustawy-o-policji.html">grants the government</a> [press release, Polish] greater access to digital data and broader use of surveillance for law enforcement. The PiS, a conservative party elected in October, holds an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34648575">overwhelming majority</a> [BBC report] of positions in the Polish government including the lead in both parliamentary houses and the presidency. In December the leader of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en">European Parliament</a> [official website] compared PiS' rise to power in Poland <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35105260">to a coup</a> [BBC report], leading to Parliament calling for an apology. PiS has <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/poland-signs-controversial-media-law-despite-eu-concerns/a-18965669">rejected</a> [DW report] criticisms that its policies are undermining democracy in Poland. However, there is a larger concern in the EU that new Polish law will erode checks and balances on government powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of human rights experts for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20394&LangID=E">called upon</a> [press release] Turkey's government to uphold its international human rights obligations, despite declared emergency following failed coup. In particular, the experts ask that Turkey does not invoke Article 4 of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) [materials], which allows governments to relax obligations under the Covenant, or at the very least strictly adhere to the restraints provided within Article 4. The experts said "invocation of Article 4 is lawful only if there is a threat to the life of the nation, a condition that arguably is not met in this case," and stressed that "one cannot avoid, even in times of emergency, obligations to protect the right to life, prohibit torture, adhere to fundamental elements of due process and non-discrimination," and other obligations. Since the attempted coup on July 15, there has been a purge within education, the media, military and justice sectors, and there have been documented instances of torture and poor detention conditions.</p>

<p>The aftermath of the failed coup attempt last month continues as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] that those involved in the coup would "pay a heavy price." Last week an Istanbul court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/turkish-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-us-based-fetullah-gulen-over-coup.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] an arrest warrant for Pennsylvania-based preacher, Fetullah Gulen, on charges of orchestrating the attempted coup. Also last week Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/top-eu-rights-official-urges-turkey-to-respect-rule-of-law.php">arrived</a> [JURIST report] in Turkey to meet with a variety of Turkish officials to urge for respect for the rule of law. Last month Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-turkish-government-attacking-press-freedom-in-coup-aftermath.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Turkey's decision to issue arrest warrants for 42 journalists. Also last month Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkey-closes-thousands-of-private-schools-charities-and-other-institutions.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the closure of thousands of private schools, charities, and other institution</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/">United Nations</a> (UN) [official website] <a href="http://uniraq.org/images/humanrights/UNAMI%20OHCHR_Report%20Yezidi%20Survivors%20A%20Call%20for%20Justice_FINAL_12Aug2016.pdf">issued a report</a> [report, PDF] on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54709#.V7dsNpiU02x">detailing</a> [UN News Centre report] the "terrible atrocities" committed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) against the Yezidi people and other ethnic and religious groups. The report was put together by the <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/">UN Assistance Mission for Iraq</a> (UNAMI) and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official websites] and contains numerous accounts from those who have survived ISIL's actions in Iraq, including systematic killing, sexual violence, inhumane treatment, and forced displacement. Based on the report, it is believed that approximately 3,500 women, girls, and some men, the vast majority of which are Yezidi, remain in captured by ISIL. The report also calls the various violations and abuses by ISIL akin to war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. The report ends saying "everything feasible must be done to create safe, dignified conditions for the Yezidi" and all others in ISIL captivity.</p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that IS "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Also in March the US House of Representatives unanimously passed a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and called for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states. In December Amnesty International said that IS is in possession of a "large and lethal" <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/12/amnesty-islamic-state-armed-due-to-reckless-arms-trading-with-iraq.php">arsenal</a> [JURIST report] due to decades of reckless arms trading and the poorly regulated international flow of weapons into Iraq. In November IS claimed responsibility for a series of coordinated attacks in <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/arrests-made-in-connection-to-france-terrorist-attacks.php">Paris</a> [JURIST report] that killed more than 120 individuals. In September members of Iraq's Yazidi community met with International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and urged the court to open a genocide <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/09/iraq-yazidi-minority-urge-icc-genocide-investigation.php">investigation</a> [JURIST report] into IS actions in Northern Iraq.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.txcourts.gov/cca">Texas Court of Criminal Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/files/pdf/WoodJL_wrt02_ord.pdf">granted</a> [opinion, PDF] a stay of execution on Friday for murder accomplice Jeffrey Lee Wood. Wood and Daniel Reneau <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/us/texas-execution-jeff-wood/">attempted to rob</a> [CNN report] a gas station in 1996. Wood waited in the car while Reneau went inside the store and ultimately shot and killed the store's clerk. In Texas, the distinction between committing a murder and acting as an accomplice to murder does not prevent the latter from being charged and convicted of first degree murder. The appellate court remanded the following two arguments to the trial court for resolution while the execution is stayed: false and misleading testimony by the prosecution's psychiatrist and false psychiatric testimony concerning Wood's future dangerousness, both allegedly presented in violation of due process. Wood's mental capacity has been at the forefront of the argument against his execution, but was never brought before the jury that imposed his death sentence. A federal judge previously <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/us/22texas.html?_r=0">stayed</a> [NYT report] Wood's execution in 2008 to grant a hearing on whether he was mentally competent.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST Commentary report] remains a controversial issue worldwide. Last week, UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-urges-maldives-to-maintain-death-penalty-moratorium.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Maldives to abide by a decades-old moratorium on the death penalty. Earlier this month, the Delaware Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/delaware-top-court-strikes-down-death-penalty-law-as-unconstitutional-1.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state's death penalty statute is unconstitutional. Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that he would approve reinstating the death penalty. In February, a spokesperson for the OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-expert-urges-indonesia-to-halt-executions-for-drug-related-offenses.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Indonesian government to halt all executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="https://www.un.org/en/sc/">Security Council</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12481.doc.htm">expressed</a> [press release] regret on Friday regarding postponed elections in Somalia. The council <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/security-council-regrets-election-delay-somalia-41514666">called on</a> [AP report] all parties to implement the 2016 electoral calendar without delay. The parliamentary elections, planned to take place sometime between late September and early October, were originally scheduled to take place in August. The parliamentary elections were delayed because additional preparation is needed and an electoral college of approximately 14,000 people is planned to participate. The council <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54717#.V7iEO2WMBBx">emphasized</a> [UN News Centre report] that the electoral process this year is a stepping stone to universal suffrage elections in 2020 and urged the government to ensure a credible and transparent electoral process.</p>

<p>Somalia has been in turmoil for years due to issues of poverty, hunger and war. In November, UN Assistant Secretary-General for human rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-urges-continued-international-support-for-somalia.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Somalia's international partners to increase their aid to the country in order for the government to maintain its gains in protecting its citizens' human rights. In October, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-welcomes-somalias-ratification-of-child-rights--convention.php">praised</a> [JURIST report] the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by the government of Somalia and encouraged the US to follow suit. Last June, the UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Somalia <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-expert-presses-somalia-government-for-further-protections.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government to continue working to increase human rights protections. Last April, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-somalia-government-evicted-thousands-of-displaced-people.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Somali government officials evicted thousands of displaced people from Mogadishu in March 2015. Last February, Somalia's Prime minister <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/somalia-prime-minister-urges-us-banks-to-resume-money-transfers.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the US government and US banks to resume allowing money transfers to Somalia, a crucial service for many in the war-torn country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Jersey enacts law increasing benefits for children of fallen state troopers</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Jersey Governor <a href="http://nj.gov/governor/">Chris Christie</a> [official website] signed the <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/S2500/2061_R1.PDF">Sweeney Bill</a> (SB 2061) [text, PDF] into law on Thursday, increasing the accidental death benefits for surviving children of fallen state troopers to 70% of final compensation.  The Sweeney Bill amendments change the benefit distribution criteria as they relate to New Jersey's <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/pensions/sprs1.shtml">State Police Retirement System</a> (SPRS) and <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/treasury/pensions/pfrs1.shtml">Police and Fireman Retirement System</a> (PFRS) [official websites].  According to the New Jersey Senate Democrats, the prior law <a href="http://www.njsendems.org/sweeney-bill-to-aid-children-of-fallen-troopers-becomes-law/">granted</a> [press release] only 20 percent death benefits for the first child, 35 percent for two or 50 percent for three or more children.  With the Sweeney Bill amendments, "all minor children of State Troopers who die in the line of duty would be entitled to the same amount of death benefits, including the children of unmarried couples" matching the 70% benefits that only surviving spouses are currently entitled to receive.  Furthermore, the bill also extends the maximum age until which a child could receive benefits to 18 years of age or older if they are enrolled in a secondary school, or 24 years of age if they are enrolled in an institution of higher education for at least 12 credits per semester. However, a surviving parent that was not married to a fallen trooper, while still obligated to manage and distribute the benefits being paid for their minor children, is <a href="http://www.nj.com/burlington/index.ssf/2016/08/how_a_new_law_will_help_the_newborn_baby_of_late_n.html">currently still ineligible</a> [NJ.Com report] to enjoy the benefits for themselves, unlike legally married spouses.  </p>

<p>This new development comes in the wake of New Jersey State Trooper Sean Cullen's death, which occurred when Cullen was <a href="http://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/index.ssf/2016/03/nj_trooper_struck_by_car_dies_of_injuries.html">struck and killed</a> [NJ.Com report] by a motor vehicle on Interstate 295 in West Deptford.  At the time, Cullen was responding to a car accident where an injured motorist was trapped inside a burning car.  No charges have been filed against the driver of the vehicle that struck Cullen, and he has fully cooperated with the police.  Cullen leaves behind a newborn and a 15-month-old child.  This law comes into effect nearly five months after Cullen's death.  <a href="http://senatorsweeney.com/">Senate President Steve Sweeney</a> [official website], after whom the bill is named, stated: &#8220;We ask our law enforcement officers and emergency response workers to put themselves in harm&#8217;s way, as Trooper Cullen and so many other troopers do every day .... This law provides the reassurance that all of our law enforcement officers and firefighters need when they go to work.&#8221;  Last month, the governor of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/texas-governor-announces-police-protection-act.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that he plans to propose a law providing for additional punishment for crimes against law enforcement officers. In May, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed a "Blue Lives Matter" bill that <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">raises the penalties</a> [JURIST report] for crimes against police officers.<br />

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.civilrights.org/?referrer=https://www.google.com/">Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights</a> and data analysis company <a href="https://www.teamupturn.com/">Upturn</a> [official websites] released the <a href="https://www.bwcscorecard.org/">Body Worn Cameras Scorecard</a> [statistical report] on Saturday, a report which concluded that the policies concerning civil rights and the use of body cameras varied widely in more than 50 police departments that were evaluated. Each department's body camera policies were evaluated based upon eight criteria derived from civil rights principles on body worn cameras.  The study considered whether the department: 1) makes the policies publicly and readily accessible, 2) limits officer discretion on when to record, 3) addresses personal privacy concerns, 4) prohibits officer pre-report viewing, 5) limits retention of footage, 6) protects the footage against tampering and misuse, 7) makes the footage available to individuals filing complaints and 8) limits the use of biometric technologies.  The <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-civil-rights-scorecard-gives-mixed-reviews-body-cameras-n634566">report found</a> [NBC News report] that the Ferguson and Fresno police departments failed every single criterion on the scorecard, while San Francisco, DC and Chicago's policies were recognized as "model" examples. Additionally, it was found that the Milwaukee police department, while prohibiting officers from gaining unauthorized access to footage, did not prohibit officers from "modifying, deleting, or otherwise tampering with footage."  Baton Rouge, Minneapolis, and Baltimore do not make their policies available on their website, while Pittsburgh and Detroit do not make their policies available at all. President and CEO of Leadership Conference <a href="http://www.civilrights.org/about/the-leadership-conference/biowade.html">Wayne Henderson</a> [official profile] stated: "There is an assumption that these cameras protect the civil rights and privacy of communities under surveillance but ... cameras are just a tool and not a substitute for broader reforms." </p>

<p>Policing incidents related to body cameras and racial profiling have been a highly contested issue dating back to the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28841715">Ferguson shootings</a> [BBC report] from last year.  In January, JURIST Guest Columnist Alexander Burns <a href="/dateline/2016/01/alexander-burns-body-camera.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] the pressure and struggles faced by police departments in the state of Indiana in implementing body cameras.  In August 2015 <a href="http://www.illinois.gov/gov/Pages/default.aspx">Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/illinois-governor-signs-police-body-camera-bill-into-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] the Law Enforcement Body Worn Camera Act into law, establishing sweeping regulations for police officers' use of body cameras while on duty.  The previous month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's office <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/new-jersey-announces-plan-for-police-body-cameras.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that the New Jersey State Police will spend $1.5 million to acquire 1,000 body cameras for troopers, in addition to the implementation of new guidelines aimed at expanding disclosures about investigations of officers' use of force. In February of the same year the self-defense products company <a href="https://www.taser.com/">TASER International Inc.</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arizona-sheriff-deputies-to-receive-body-cameras.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that Maricopa County Sheriff's Office will be receiving an order of cameras which will be worn by officers to record their actions in the field. Under the sales agreement, TASER would deliver 700 body cameras, costing an estimated $1 million. In 2014 the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/cat/pages/catindex.aspx">Committee Against Torture</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/un-committee-urges-us-to-investigate-police-brutality-and-limit-use-of-tasers---dnp.php">urged the US</a> [JURIST report] to open investigations into all cases of police brutality and excessive use of force by police officers. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">United Nations</a> (UN) [official website] on Friday said that it is becoming increasingly alarmed by "catastrophic" levels of suffering in Nigeria, as more rights violations are being exposed while the anti-Boko Haram military campaign <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54713#.V7nA_vkrLIV">advances</a> [UN News Centre report]. Adrian Edwards, a spokesperson for the Office of the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) [official website] <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2016/8/57b6cae87/unhcr-military-advances-northeast-nigeria-uncovering-vast-urgent-humanitarian.html">stated</a> [press briefing],<blockquote>While many areas are still beyond reach, in Borno and Yobe States the picture of suffering is shocking. There are numerous reports of human rights violations, including deaths, sexual violence, disappearances, forced recruitment, forced religious conversions and attacks on civilian sites. Some 800,000 additional internally displaced people have been identified as needing help.</blockquote>The military activity has caused the displacement issues to spread across the Lake Chad basin borders to areas of Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Women, children and elderly make up large portions of the displaced people, and many of those in need of help are malnourished and exhausted as well. The UNHCR is ramping up efforts to deliver humanitarian aid, focusing first on highly vulnerable areas. However, many areas needing assistance can only be accessed with military escorts.</p>

<p>The militant Islamic group <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501">Boko Haram</a> [BBC backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Boko+Haram&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">news archive</a>], whose name means "Western education is a sin," has been fighting to overthrow the Nigerian government in the interest of creating an Islamist state. Earlier this month <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-sc-applauds-eu-for-donation-to-anti-boko-haram-task-force.php">applauded</a> [JURIST report] the European Union for donating 50 million euro (approximately $55,435,000 USD) to the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF). The MNJTF was created by Lake Chad basin countries in an effort to combat Boko Haram. Last month, the Secretary-General <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-sg-condemns-terrorist-attacks-in-nigeria.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] yet another attack by Boko Haram in Nigeria that left 30 dead and approximately 80 injured. In April the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/un-rights-chief-boko-haram-killing-captive-women.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Boko Haram militants in Nigeria have been murdering women and girls previously taken captive by the group. The group has been <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/ai-boko-haram-has-killed-hundreds-of-civilians-in-northern-cameroon.php">increasing the intensity and frequency of its attacks</a> [JURIST report] ever since it lost most of the territory it overtook earlier this year to the Nigerian army. Most of these attacks have centered around markets, bus stations, places of worship and hit-and-run attacks on villages.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">United Nations</a> (UN) [official website] official on Saturday expressed deep concern for the health of Bilal Kayed, a Palestinian detainee that has been on hunger strike for <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54723#.V7nBBPkrLIV">more than two months</a> [UN News Centre report]. <a href="http://www.unocha.org/sahel/about-ocha-sahel/regional-humanitarian-coordinator-sahel">Robert Piper</a> [official profile], the UN Coordinator for Humanitarian Assistance and Development Aid in the occupied Palestinian territory, released his <a href="http://www.unsco.org/Documents/Statements/SC/2016/Statement%20by%20UN%20Coordinator%20for%20Humanitarian%20Assistance%20and%20Development%20Aid%20Piper%20-%2020%20August%202016.pdf">statement</a> [text, PDF] and called the situation "an egregious case." Kayed was set to be released after serving a 14.5-year prison sentence, but he was placed on administrative detention and has not been released, charged or given any form of trial. Kayed began his hunger strike in protest of his detention, and six other detainees are following suit to protest their detentions and prolonged solitary confinement. Another 100 prisoners across Israel have begun hunger strikes in solidarity. "The number of administrative detainees is at an eight-year high. I reiterate the United Nations long-standing position that all administrative detainees &mdash; Palestinian or Israeli &mdash; should be charged or released without delay."</p>

<p>The increase in violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created a contentious human rights situation. In July Israeli lawmakers passed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/israel-passes-law-increasing-regulation-on-human-rights-organizations.php">controversial law</a> [JURIST report] increasing regulation on Israeli human rights organizations. Also in July <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] called upon Palestinian and Israeli officials to properly address human rights violations <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-palestine-and-israel-officials-need-to-deal-with-war-crimes.php">committed by their forces</a> [JURIST report]. In February Piper expressed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-official-expresses-concern-over-administrative-detention-in-israel-and-palestine.php">similar concern to the present case</a> [JURIST report] regarding "the continued practice of administrative detention in Israeli jails and detention centers."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Officials in the Iraqi province of Dhi Qar on Sunday administered the hanging of 36 men convicted for their participation in the Speicher massacre of 2014. The event infamously involved the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/21/iraq-hangs-men-convicted-speicher-massacre-shia-tikrit">kidnapping and killing</a> [Guardian report] of 1,700 military recruits by Sunni militants claimed to be members of the Islamic State (IS). The massacre has since been known as one of the greatest IS atrocities in the country. The executions were performed in Dhi Qar's Nasiriyah prison and overseen by governor Yahya al-Nasseri and the justice minister. Al-Nasseri has recently fast-tracked the execution of convicted terrorists following last month's <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36701882">suicide bombing in Baghdad</a> [BBC report]. These executions have drawn heavy criticism from advocacy groups criticizing Iraq for ignoring human rights standards. </p>

<p>Iraq has long faced international criticism from for its use of the death penalty. Earlier this month UN human rights official Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-iraq-expediting-death-sentences.php">deplored</a> [JURIST report] Iraq's efforts to expedite implementation of the death penalty. In February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International </a> (AI) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-criticizes-iraq-over-death-sentences.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the state of justice in Iraq after a court sentenced 40 men to death also connected to the Speicher massacre. Last August a spokesperson for the UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/WelcomePage.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/un-denounces-iraq-executions.php">spoke against the execution</a> [JURIST report] of an Iraqi man and his two wives in the Kurdistan region. In 2014 UN officials called on the government of Iraq to <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-urges-iraq-to-place-moratorium-on-death-penalty.php">impose a moratorium</a> [JURIST report] on the death penalty in response to a significant rise in executions since the country restored capital punishment in 2005.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday threatened to withdraw the country from the UN following criticisms against his controversial crackdown on the illegal drugs. Since taking office, Duterte has used <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/21/asia/philippines-duterte-threatens-to-leave-un/">extreme methods</a> [CNN report] to dispose of anyone connected to the nations illegal drug trade. Duterte has ordered the police force to hunt down criminals and kill them should they refuse to surrender. The UN recently <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20388&LangID=E">stated</a> [UN report] that over 850 people have so far been killed as a result of Duterte's campaign. UN Special Rapporteur Agnes Callamard stated that Duterte must abide by his international obligations and human rights standards despite the threats that the illegal drug trade may pose. In response Duterte harshly accused the UN of providing no benefit to the Philippines and told the UN to " take us out of your organization". Duterte further <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/news/crime/article/Duterte-threatens-to-withdraw-Philippines-from-9175665.php">threatened</a> [<em>CT Post</em> report] to form a new international organization comprised of other Asian and African nations critical of the UN. </p>

<p>Duterte took the presidential office in May after <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-president-duterte-takes-office-filipinos-divided-on-dirty-harry-1467320403">promising</a> [WSJ report] the Filipino population that he will restore their broken society, redistribute the wealth, and aggressively crackdown on corruption and crime. During his campaign, Duterte <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/rodrigo-duterte-links-150-judges-and-politicians-to-drugs-trade">declared</a> [Guardian report] that 100,000 people would die in his crackdown on crime. Since Duterte has taken office, about 400 suspected drug dealers have been killed and 600,000 have surrendered to the police. Earlier this month, Duterte <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/phillippines-president-names-government-officials-connected-to-illegal-drug-trade.php">named</a> [JURIST report] 150 serving and former state officials connected to the nation's illegal drug trade and ordered them to either surrender to the authorities or risk being hunted down. Duterte has stated that he disregards criticisms from the UN and human rights groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas</a> [official website] on Sunday <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/files/epress/Texas_et_al_v._U.S._et_al_-_Nationwide_PI_(08-21-16).pdf">temporarily blocked</a> [order, PDF] federal guidelines that allowed transgender students to use the bathroom according to the gender with which they identify. Judge Reed O&#8217;Connor found that the federal government overstepped its authority in issuing the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-departments-justice-and-education-release-joint-guidance-help-schools-ensure-civil-rights">guidance</a> [press release] in May. A group of 13 states <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">challenged the guidelines</a> [JURIST report]. In his 38-page order granting the motion for preliminary injunction, O'Connor concluded that, "Defendants failed to comply with the Administrative Procedures Act by: (1) foregoing the Administrative Procedures Act's notice and comment requirements; and (2) issuing directives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory texts." Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton <a href="https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ruling-in-favor-of-school-and-state-rights-federal-court-stops-enforcement">welcomed the ruling</a> [press release]. A spokesperson for the US Department of Justice said they are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/us/transgender-bathroom-access-guidelines-blocked-by-judge.html?_r=0">reviewing their options</a> [NYT report].</p>

<p>Earlier this month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-allowing-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling allowing a transgender student who identifies as male to use the boy's restroom at school. In July US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter  announced a new policy [materials] that allows transgender individuals to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/ban-on-transgender-service-members-lifted.php">serve openly in the military</a> [JURIST report], effective immediately. In May Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced legislation that would <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-pm-proposes-legislation-banning-transgender-discrimination.php">ban transgender discrimination</a> [JURIST report], including it within Canada's hate crime laws. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mexican <a href="www.presidencia.gob.mx">President Enrique Peña Nieto</a> [official website, in Spanish] plagiarized the thesis for his law degree according to a <a href="http://aristeguinoticias.com/especiales/2016/especial/8ago/el-plagio/index.html">report</a> [documents, in Spanish] released on Sunday. A group of academics and experts <a href="http://aristeguinoticias.com/2108/mexico/pena-nieto-de-plagiador-a-presidente/">found</a> [Aristegui Noticias report] that of the 682 paragraph thesis, at least 197 paragraphs were taken from other writers and that 20 of those paragraphs were copied word for word from another author without citation or reference in the bibliography. At least 28.8 percent of the thesis was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/mexico-president-enrique-pena-nieto-plagiarized-thesis-law-degree">plagiarized</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and in one instance, of the 36 paragraphs written about Mexican Revolutionary General and President Álvaro Obregón, 35 of those paragraphs were copied word for word from a number of sources. A government spokesman has since <a href="http://time.com/4461186/mexican-president-plagiarize-law-thesis/">assured</a> [<em>Time</em> report] the public that the president met all the requirements to graduate from Panamerican University (UP) and that the lack of citations are style errors.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SuMirsvkTCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Peña Nieto is not the only major politician that has been accused of or found to have plagiarized in the past. Most recently last month, Melania Trump's speech at the Republic national convention was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-republican-convention-plagiarism-michelle-obama">reportedly</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] taken verbatim from First Lady Michelle Obama's speech in the 2008 Democratic convention. In 2013 Senator Rand Paul was <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/19/politics/politicians-plagiarism/">accused</a> [CNN report] of heavily plagiarizing for a book and several speeches. In 2006, Brookings Institution researchers <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-mystery-of-vladimir-putins-dissertation/">reported</a> [Brookings Institution report] that there was evidence that showed that there was extensive plagiarism in Vladimir Putin's dissertation which he submitted to the St. Petersburg Mining Institute in 1996. In 1987, Joe Biden, the then-presidential candidate was accused [NYT report] of plagiarizing the speeches of various politicians including British Labour Party Neil Kinnock and John F. Kennedy. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Libya's House of Representatives gave the country's Government of National Accord (GNA) a vote of no confidence on Monday. The Tripoli and western-based GNA is supported by Western powers and the UN, but the eastern-based House of Representatives <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/libyas-parliament-rejects-un-backed-unity-government/2016/08/22/a86c08de-6886-11e6-91cb-ecb5418830e9_story.html">voted against</a> [WP report] endorsing the GNA from exerting its authority throughout the country. Sixty-one legislators voted <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/libya-backed-government-confidence-vote-160822150247789.html">against</a> [Al Jazeera report], 39 abstained, and only one voted in favor of the GNA. Pro-GNA legislators criticized the vote because many <a href="http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/libya-parliament-votes-no-confidence-in-un-backed-government">said</a> [Military Times report] that they were not told about the vote, and it is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-un-idUSKCN10X1DY">unclear</a> [Reuters report] whether the GNA will continue to seek endorsement from the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Libya has remained politically unstable since the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 deposition of Muammar Gaddafi</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and subsequent civil war. In May, International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/icc-prosecutor-accountability-and-justice-critical-in-libya.php">told</a> [JURIST report] the UN Security Council that justice and accountability were crucial aspects of achieving and maintaining peace in the country. Also in May, Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-islamic-state-has-executed-dozens-in-sirte-libya.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Islamic State militants had executed 49 people in the Libyan city of Sirte since seizing control in February 2015. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-report-libya-abuses-may-amount-to-war-crimes.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report in February detailing a "litany of violations and abuses" being committed by both state and non-state actors in the Libyan conflict that could amount to war crimes. In January, the internationally-recognized Libyan parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/libya-parliament-rejects-unity-government.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to reject a proposal by the then-UN-supported unity government to curb the country's political crisis. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/EN_Menus/ICC/Pages/default.aspx">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] opened the trial of <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf">Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi</a> [case information, PDF] Monday for the destruction of historical and religious monuments in Timbuktu. Al Mahdi <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1236">admitted guilt</a> [press release] Monday, apologizing for his actions. ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda gave an <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=otp-stat-al-mahdi-160822">opening statement</a> [text], calling the trial "historic." After the prosecution concludes its presentation, the victims' legal representative and then the defense will have the opportunity to be heard. Judges will then deliberate on Al Mahdi's guilt and possible sentence.</p>

<p>The danger to world heritage sites and other important landmarks in Mali is not the only concern among the international community regarding the country. Mali has been facing a humanitarian crisis since 2012 that has raised graver international concerns. In May 2012 <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a report saying that Mali was facing its <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mali-facing-human-rights-crisis-amnesty.php">worst human rights crisis</a> [JURIST report] since it gained independence in 1960. Human Rights Watch released a similar report in April 2012 claiming that all sides to the conflict are <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/all-sides-in-mali-conflict-have-committed-war-crimes-hrw.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April the ICC said they would <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-closely-monitoringsituation-in-mali.php">monitor the situation</a> [JURIST report] in Mali for potential crimes under the ICC's jurisdiction. The turmoil began when Taureg rebels <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/01/20121182151622785.html">attacked Malian soldiers</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Many in the international community <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-rights-expert-concerned-with-ongoing-violence-refugee-safety-in-mali.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the situation, including <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website], then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> [official website]. All of this came after Malian soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/mali-soldiers-take-control-of-government-suspend-constitution.php">took control of the government</a> [JURIST report] and suspended the constitution in March 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A Bangladesh court on Tuesday postponed the trial of 18 people facing charges stemming from a 2013 garment factory collapse that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,100 people. Approximately <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/rana-plaza-tragedy-bangladesh-puts-18-trial-160823051641161.html">130 witnesses</a> [Al Jazeera report] were set to take the stand during the trial to testify about allegations that the building was unsafe and additional floors were added to the building despite being a hazard. Defendants sought a delay to challenge their charges with a higher court. The proceedings have been postponed until October 26. Some are calling the postponement a delay of justice.</p>

<p>In July a Bangladesh court officially <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/bangladesh-court-indicts-41-for-murder-in-connection-with-2013-garment-factory-collapse.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] 41 people with murder stemming from the 2013 garment factory collapse. Initially charged with culpable homicide, the defendants were <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/bangladesh-garment-factory-owners-charged-with-murder-over-worker-deaths.php">charged with murder</a> [JURIST report] upon further investigation of their conduct. Investigators found that the defendants illegally added floors to the original five-story Rana Complex to compete in Bangladesh's highly profitable garment exporting industry. Prior to the building's collapse, the staff allegedly forced workers to stay in the unstable establishment despite concerns that the structure was visibly cracking. Earlier this year <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/bangladesh-workers-demand-justice-on-anniversary-of-garment-factory-collapse.php">Bangladeshi workers gathered</a> [JURIST report] on the third anniversary of the Rana Plaza garment factory disaster to demand justice for the incident.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Prosecutors in Ukraine on Monday <a href="http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/365163.html">announced charges</a> [Interfax-Ukraine report] against 18 top Russian officials over the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. During a press conference <a href="http://112.international/article/attorney-general-top-10-facts-from-the-life-of-yuriy-lutsenko-4827.html">Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko</a> [112 UA profile] <a href="http://uatoday.tv/crime/dozens-of-russian-citizens-are-prosecuted-for-waging-war-against-ukraine-lutsenko-732027.html">announced the charges</a> [UA Today report] stating that those named were suspected of committing "particularly grave crimes against Ukraine's national and public security, peace and international order."</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In July a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">56-page report</a> [JURIST report] by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International alleged that Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in Ukraine have subjected citizen to "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including refusing necessary medical attention. In June the UN human rights office reported that the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ukraine-rights-violations-persist.php">human rights situation in Ukraine remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia. In February Russia <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/russia-files-lawsuit-against-ukraine-over-3-billion-eurobond-debt.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Ukraine over Ukraine's default on $3 billion in bonds. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">plans to sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the International Court of Justice on claims of financing terrorism. In August a Russian military court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Ukrainian activists to substantial jail time for the charge of conspiring to commit terror attacks. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its policy of refusing to recognize <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report]. In February 2015 Russian liberal political activist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31669061">Boris Nemtsov was shot in the back four times</a> [BBC report] in the middle of busy downtown Moscow. Nemtsov was openly politically opposed to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in Ukraine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/16a0204p-06.pdf">upheld</a> [opinion, PDF] cuts to early voting in Ohio as well as the elimination of the so-called "Golden Week" in which voters could register and cast their votes simultaneously. Ohio previously allowed 35 days of early in-person voting but cut that to 29 days and eliminated the Golden Week provision. Ohio Democrats and others alleged that the change would disproportionately impact minorities. A federal judge ruled in May that this was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] and in violation of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act">Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act</a> (VRA) [DOJ materials], but the Sixth Circuit reversed:<blockquote>Nearly a third of the states offer no early voting. Adopting plaintiffs' theory of disenfranchisement would create a "one-way ratchet" that would discourage states from ever increasing early voting opportunities, lest they be prohibited by federal courts from later modifying their election procedures in response to changing circumstances. Further, while the challenged regulation may slightly diminish the convenience of registration and voting, it applies even-handedly to all voters, and, despite the change, Ohio continues to provide generous, reasonable, and accessible voting options to all Ohioans. The issue is not whether some voter somewhere would benefit from six additional days of early voting or from the opportunity to register and vote at the same time. Rather, the issue is whether the challenged law results in a cognizable injury under the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. We conclude that it does not.</blockquote>Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted <a href="http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/mediaCenter/2016/2016-08-23-a.aspx">praised the ruling</a> [press release], saying, "I hope the Democrats will end their wasteful lawsuits so we can all move forward with this election."</p>

<p>Voting rights have been the subject of numerous legal challenges across the US, particularly in a presidential election year. Last month a three-judge panel for the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-portions-of-north-carolina-voting-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] several provisions of <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H589v9.pdf">North Carolina's House Bill 589</a> (HB 589) [text, PDF], most notably its voter identification requirements. In May a federal judge ruled that Virginia's voter ID law, which requires that voters have a valid form of ID either before voting or within three days after voting, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-upholds-virginia-voter-id-law.php">is constitutional</a> [JURIST report]. Also in May a federal judge ruled that Kansas cannot require voters to <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-blocks-kansas-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement.php">provide proof of citizenship</a> [JURIST report] when registering to vote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several state and religiously affiliated organizations filed <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Franciscan-Alliance-et-al-v.-Burwell-et-al-Complaint-FINAL.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in federal court Tuesday regarding the Affordable Care Act's rule banning discrimination on the basis of sex, including gender identity. The plaintiffs include the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the Franciscan Alliance, the Christian Medical & Dental Association, and Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, Texas and Wisconsin. The lawsuit argues that the ACA's <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-18/pdf/2016-11458.pdf">rule</a> [text, PDF] forces doctors to administer treatments that would be against their religious beliefs. The plaintiffs assert that doctors would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/23/transgender-health-discrimination-ban-obama-lawsuit">forced</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to perform sex change operations on children averse to the doctors' judgment and the children's development. Many medical associations argue that medical care related to transitioning is medically necessary and the <a href="http://www.transequality.org">National Center for Transgender Equality</a> (NCTE) [advocacywebsite] <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-08-23/states-religious-groups-file-lawsuit-against-transgender-provisions-in-obamacare">maintains</a> [US News report] that doctors will not be forced to administer procedures against their better judgment, but will be required to make sure that transgender people can get necessary treatment.</p>

<p>Transgender access to healthcare has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. This week a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-transgender-bathroom-access-guidelines.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] federal guidelines that allowed transgender students to use the bathroom according to the gender with which they identify. Earlier this month a divided US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-allowing-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an application to recall and stay lower court orders allowing a transgender student who identities as a male to use the men's restroom in school. Last month Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/massachusetts-governor-signs-transgender-anti-discrimination-law.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a bill into law protecting against discrimination on the basis of gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed <a href="https://www.ada.gov/olmstead/documents/gnets_complaint.html">suit</a> [complaint] against Georgia on Tuesday alleging that the state discriminates against students with behavior-related disabilities. The DOJ argues that the state's Georgia Network for Educational and Therapeutic Support Program (GNETS) violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibition on the "unnecessary segregation of persons with disabilities in state programs, services, and activities." The complaint provides that students in the GNETS program are educated in a classroom used for detention that is located in the basement of the general education school and students in the program do not <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/292375-doj-sues-georgia-for-segregating-students-with-disabilities">interact</a> [<em>The Hill</em> report] with other students and never leave the basement. Furthermore, the DOJ maintains that Georgia discriminates against GNET students by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-justice-dept-lawsuit_us_57bca778e4b00d9c3a1a77d8">denying</a> [<em>Huffington Post</em> report] them "equal opportunity to access and benefit from the educational services available to students throughout the state" that are not placed in the GNETS program.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ada.gov">ADA</a> (official website) is a US civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. The act <a href="https://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12102">defines</a> [law] disability as the following: (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of an individual; (2) a record of such an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment. The act prohibits covered entities from discriminating against qualified individuals on the basis on a disability in the following areas: job application procedures, hiring, job advancement, discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and privileges of employment. The act also prohibits state or local governments, departments, agencies, or other public entities from denying the benefits of services, programs, or activities of a public entity. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN humans rights experts on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20403&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the government of Bangladesh to repeal the death sentence imposed upon Mir Quasem Ali, an opposition member of the Jamaat-e-Islami party. The experts stated that "Mr. Ali's trial and appeal processes were reportedly marred with irregularities and failed to meet international standards on fair trial and due process for the imposition of the death penalty." In order to impose the death penalty, the most severe form of punishment, trials must comply with the most strict requirements set forth by international law. The human rights group also voiced concerns regarding the abduction of Mr. Ali's son and part of his legal defense team leading up to the review hearing. </p>

<p>Mir Quasem Ali, was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangladesh-warcrimes-idUSKCN0WA0DN">accused</a> [Reuters report] of murder and torture during the 1971 war of independence. More than 3 million people are believed to have died in the war and thousands of women raped, but the Jamaat-e-Islami party insists it did not commit any war crimes. Quasem Ali went into hiding when other members of the party were arrested in late 1971. He was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/bangladesh-police-arrest-high-profile-war-crimes-suspect.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report in 2012 and sentenced to death in 2014 by the International Crimes Tribunal. The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/nweb/">Supreme Court of Bangladesh</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] his death sentence in March. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The  <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) [official website] <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/02-RC-143012">determined 3-1</a> [case materials] Tuesday that student assistants working at private colleges are statutory employees covered by the National Labor Relations Act. The case was filed by graduate students at Columbia University representing graduate and undergraduate student assistants. The majority opinion reversed the holding in Brown University. The majority found no reason to exclude student assistants from protection due to the fact that the Act is free of language prohibiting this coverage. </p>

<p>In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/nlrb-dismisses-petition-for-college-athlete-union.php">declined to assert jurisdiction</a> [JURIST report] over whether <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a> [official website] football players can form a union, overturning its 2014 <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/default/server_files/files/NU%20Decision%20and%20Direction%20of%20Election.pdf">decision</a> [opinion, PDF] which recognized the players as <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/national-labor-relations-board-finds-northwestern-football-players-are-university-employees.php">university employees</a> [JURIST report]. The Board held that asserting jurisdiction "would not promote labor stability due to the nature and structure of NCAA Division I Football Subdivisions." The Board noted that Northwestern University is a state-run institution and that, by statute, the Board has no jurisdiction over state-run schools.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.un.org/en/index.html">United Nations</a> (UN) [official website] Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54752#.V79aL0uQnGs">submitted a report</a> [official press release] issued together with the <a href="https://www.opcw.org">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> [official website] yesterday detailing an in-depth investigation into chemical warfare used by ISIS and President Assad in Syria. While the report is still confidential, Ki-Moon <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2016-08-24/statement-attributable-spokesman-secretary-general-third-report-opcw">stated</a> [press release] that he is looking forward to the publication of the report around August 30th. While the use of chemical weapons in warfare is prohibited under international laws of warfare, the UN has <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/un-rights-chief-condemns-syria-chemical-weapon-allegations.php">suspected Syria of using such weapons for years</a> [JURIST report], even though Syria formally <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/syria-signs-agreement-to-dispose-of-chemical-weapons.php">agreed to dispose of their chemical weapons in 2014</a> [JURIST report].   </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10338256">conflict in Syria</a> [BBC backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war based around the legitimacy of President Bashar al-Assad [BBC reports]. Earlier this month, Amnesty International said that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-syria-chlorine-gas-attack-could-be-war-crime.php">amount to a war crime</a> [JURIST report]. The BBC reported that the Syrian government is suspected of using a chlorine gas attack in Aleppo, killing several and injuring many more. Last month <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. Last month UN human rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">called for the immediate protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians. In May <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] reported that armed opposition groups in Syria are committing war crimes around the Sheikh Maqsoud district of Aleppo city. Earlier that month top UN official Stephen O'Brien called for the immediate investigation of recent airstrikes in Syria, which may amount to war crimes for <a href="https://www.jurist.orgsyria-airstrikes-may-amount-to-war-crime.php">intentionally targeting civilians</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.law.idf.il/14-en/Patzar.aspx">legal branch of the Israel Defense Forces</a> (IDF) [official website] <a href="http://www.law.idf.il/163-7596-en/Patzar.aspx">published a report</a> [official report] yesterday that was the fifth in a series detailing the findings of investigations into the 2014 Gaza war. The report released the results of these investigations in regards to seven cases of violence during the war. The seventh case was the matter of an IDF airstrike aimed at a motorbike who exited off of a roundabout and passed in front of a United Nations Relief and Works Agency school. The attack occurred as the motorbike passed the school's gate and resulted in the deaths of multiple civilians. After reviewing the factual situation, the Military Advocate General Corps. concluded that the actions and targeting practices of the IDF airmen were in accord with domestic and international law.  </p>

<p>The violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created contentious legal and human rights situations. Last month, Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-palestine-and-israel-officials-need-to-deal-with-war-crimes.php">called upon Palestinian and Israeli officials</a> [JURIST report] in a report to properly address human rights violations committed by their forces. The UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">released closing remarks</a> [JURIST report] to its fifty-seventh session in May, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. An <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">Israeli court in April convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to the 50-day war in Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/PS/Pages/MakarimWibisono.aspx">Makarim Wibisono</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory after repeated requests.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia- People's Army reached a <a href="https://www.mesadeconversaciones.com.co/sites/default/files/24_08_2016acuerdofinalfinalfinal-1472094587.pdf">peace agreement</a> [text, in Spanish, PDF] on Wednesday. The <a href="http://equipopazgobierno.presidencia.gov.co/prensa/Paginas/comunicado-conjunto-firma-acuerdo-final-paz-gobierno-farc-colombia.aspx">agreement</a> [press release, in Spanish] in Havana, Cuba ends an over 50 year conflict between the FARC rebels (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia- Ejército del Pueblo, FARC-EP) and the government. The conflict <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/americas/farc-colombia-final-peace-deal/">claimed</a> [CNN report] over 220,000 people and displaced countless others. FARC rebels will have to hand over their weapons to United Nation's (UN) monitors and issues regarding land reform, the drug trade, repatriation of victims' families and bringing those suspected of human rights abuses to justice will be addressed. The Colombian people will have to decide on October 2, 2016, whether to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/25/491318978/farc-rebels-colombian-government-sign-historic-peace-treaty">vote</a> [NPR report] for or against the agreement.</p>

<p>The peace agreement ends more than half a decade of conflict in the South American country. In June, the Colombian government and FARC <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/colombia-and-farc-agree-to-bilateral-ceasefire.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a ceasefire as the revolutionary forces transition to a peaceful political party. In January, the UN Security Council unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-security-council-approves-peace-mission-in-colombia.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a resolution authorizing the creation of a political peace mission in Colombia to monitor the disarmament between the Colombian government and FARC rebels. In November, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-president-pardons-30-farc-guerrilla-soldiers.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report] 30 former guerrilla soldiers in jail for non-violent and minor crimes. The agreement will address land rights and in November, Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/amnesty-international-tells-columbia-to-prioritize-land-rights-of-the-indigenous-and-afro-descendant.php">said</a> [JURIST report] the Colombian government should prioritize the rights of indigenous and Afro-descendant communities above corporate interests. In September, FARC and the Colombian government <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/colombia-president-and-farc-make-progress-toward-a-peace-agreement.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] an agreement regarding punishing civil rights abuses, a move commended by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Brazilian Senate <a href="http://www12.senado.leg.br/radio/1/noticia/senado-comeca-o-julgamento-da-presidente-afastada-dilma-rousseff-nesta-quinta-feira">began</a> [press release, in Portuguese] the impeachment trial of President Dilma Rousseff on Thursday. The suspended president is scheduled to testify on Monday and has been <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/25/491330705/beginning-of-the-end-impeachment-trial-opens-for-brazils-dilma-rousseff">reported</a> [NPR report] to be increasingly isolated. Brazilian Vice President Michel Temer would become the country's president through 2018 in the event that 54 senators vote to impeach Rousseff. The media, political insiders, and supporters of the embattled president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/brazilian-president-dilma-rousseffs-impeachment-trial-begins-the-latest-crisis-in-a-traumatic-year/2016/08/25/b5306f7a-6a33-11e6-91cb-ecb5418830e9_story.html">predict</a> [WP report] that she will be removed from office next week.</p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigation and trials. Earlier this month, the Senate of Brazil officially <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/brazil-senate-votes-to-open-impeachment-trial-against-president.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] President Dilma Rousseff, marking the beginning of an impeachment trial against the embattled president. Also earlier this month, a Brazilian senate committee <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/brazil-senate-committee-votes-for-rousseff-impeachment-trial.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 14-5 to continue impeachment proceedings against the suspended president who is charged with failing to "comply with tax and budget laws on the issues of additional credit decrees". Last month, a Brazilian judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-to-stand-trial-for-obstruction.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will stand trial for obstruction of justice. In June, the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-brazil-must-advance-business-and-human-rights.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Brazil must place more emphasis on remedying and preventing business-related human right violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vice President Joe Biden stated at a press conference in Sweden on Thursday that he <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-guantanamo-biden-idUKKCN1101EL">hopes and expects</a> [Reuters report] that the Guantanamo Bay prison will be closed before President Barack Obama leaves office.  The Vice President's remarks come a day after White House Press Secretary <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/24/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-82416">Josh Earnest reiterated the president's intentions</a> [press briefing] to shut down the Guantanamo facility.  According to Earnest, there are currently 61 detainees confined at the facility, and <blockquote>"[t]here is a rigorous process of evaluating the individual cases, and this process is conducted by a review board where there are representatives of a variety of national intelligence and national security agencies who consider these individual cases ... At this point, only 20 of the 61 who are currently there have been approved for transfer."</blockquote>  Earnest clarified that only those who have been cleared for transfer will be moved to another facility. The Obama administration has been attempting to shut Guantanamo down since coming to power in 2009, but has thus far faced severe opposition from a Republican-controlled Congress. </p>

<p>Last week, the US <a href="http://www.defense.gov/">Department of Defense</a> (DOD) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/us-transfers-15-guantanamo-detainees-to-uae.php">announced the transfer</a> [JURIST report] of 15 Guantanamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Twelve of the detainees were from Yemen, and the other three were from Afghanistan. Six of the detainees had been approved for release since 2009 while the others were cleared for release more recently.  The question of shutting Guantanamo down has been one of great controversy.  Also last week, a US Senator released a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pentagon-report-discourages-guantanamo-closure.php">Pentagon Report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the profiles of those currently detained in and recently released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) concluded that closing the facility would not be in the US' best interests and would pose a safety risk. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told Fox News in January that US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/white-house-official-obama-plans-to-close-guantanamo-before-leaving-office.php">intends to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] his promise to close the Guantanamo detention facility before leaving office---a promise renewed by the Obama administration on Monday. Last November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The NDAA comes after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">DOD said</a> [JURIST report] they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the facility in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-27/pdf/E9-1893.pdf">presidential executive order</a> [text, PDF] to review the status of all detainees. In September White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest said Obama was considering a <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/wh-spokesperson-obama-still-considering-options-to-close-guantanamo.php">"wide array" of options</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN High Commissioner for human rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile], on Thursday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20411&LangID=E">called on the international community</a> [press release] to establish an independent international body for conducting comprehensive investigations of human rights violations in Yemen.  This call comes in the wake of a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/YE/OHCHRYemen_report2016_EN.docx">report</a> released earlier today which highlighted various allegations of serious human rights violations and abuses committed by all sides in the Yemen conflict.  The report further highlighted the impact of the war on civilian lives and health, and the country's infrastructure.  Among other things, the report lists various examples of attacks in residential areas, marketplaces, medical and educational facilities, sniper attacks against civilians, recruitment and use of children in hostilities.  The report also noted the inability of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] to identify the existence of any potential military objective in many of the documented military attacks.  In reaching out for support for establishing the new body, Al Hussein stated: "[Civilians in Yemen] continue to suffer, absent any form of accountability and justice, while those responsible for the violations and abuses against them enjoy impunity .... The international community&#8230; has a legal and moral duty to take urgent steps to alleviate the appalling levels of human despair."</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. According to the report identified above, there have been 3,799 civilian deaths and 6,711 injuries to date since March 2015 in Yemen. The civilian death estimate was at <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-office-yemen-civilian-death-toll-reaches-nearly-2800.php">only 2,800 in January</a> [JURIST report], which would mean that approximately 1,000 more have died in as little as eight months. The report further indicates that an approximate 7.6 million people, including three million women and children, are currently suffering from malnutrition and at least three million people have been displaced from their homes.  The OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-office-condemns-attacks-in-residential-areas-of-yemen.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a string of rocket and mortar attacks against residential areas and markets in Taizz, Yemen, from June 3 to June 8. In March UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-use-of-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-may-be-war-crime.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the use of cluster bombs by the Saudi-led coalition against neighborhoods in Yemen may amount to a war crime. In January the UN <a href="http://www.wfp.org/">World Food Programme</a> [official website] appealed to all the parties involved in the Yemen conflict to allow the <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-wfp-to-parties-in-yemen-conflict-allow-food-distributions-in-taiz.php">safe passage of food</a> [JURIST report] to the city of Taiz. In October <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-urges-war-crime-investigation-into-yemen-hospital-air-strike.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an independent investigation into possible war crimes surrounding the destruction of a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Yemen. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/">Ohio Supreme Court</a> [official website]<a href="http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/rod/docs/pdf/0/2016/2016-Ohio-5504.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that courts cannot use prior juvenile charges to enhance the sentence of an adult criminal offender. In a 4-3 decision, the court held that using prior juvenile charges to enhance sentencing for adult criminals is unconstitutional and "fundamentally unfair." The majority relied primarily upon two arguments. First, juvenile cases are handled in civil court and are therefore meant to help children avoid a life of crime, while criminal cases for adults are meant to punish the wrongdoer and provide retribution to society. Second, juvenile proceedings do not grant children a right to a jury trial. The dissent argued that a portion of Ohio's criminal code clarified this issue, allowing courts to use earlier juvenile convictions to enhance an adult criminal's sentence.</p>

<p>This case is the most recent in a series of attempts to reform the criminal justice system, a campaign spearheaded by President Barack Obama. Last year US President Barack Obama spoke at the NAACP Annual Convention and <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/obama-calls-for-criminal-justice-reforms.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Congress to reform the criminal justice system by enacting legislation that would enforce criminal laws fairly and reduce sentencing disparities. Earlier that week Obama <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/obama-commutes-sentences-of-46-drug-offenders.php">commuted the sentences</a> [JURIST report] of 46 drug offenders in what he said was part of an effort by his administration to remedy the unfairness of the criminal justice system. In 2014 the US Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/doj-supports-reduction-of-sentences-for-some-drug-charges.php">announced support for reducing the sentences</a> of nonviolent drug offenders in federal prisons after the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/supreme-court-rules-on-mandatory-sentencing-for-drug-dealers.php">relaxed</a> [JURIST reports] sentencing guidelines on drug dealers earlier that year. In 2013 the American Civil Liberties Union <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/aclu-more-than-3200-serving-life-without-parole-for-nonviolent-crimes.php">published a study</a> [JURIST report] finding that 3,278 Americans are currently serving life sentences without parole for nonviolent offenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's highest administrative court, the <a href="http://conseil-etat.fr/">Council of State</a> [official website, in French] on Friday <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/Decisions-Avis-Publications/Decisions/Selection-des-decisions-faisant-l-objet-d-une-communication-particuliere/CE-ordonnance-du-26-aout-2016-Ligue-des-droits-de-l-homme-et-autres-association-de-defense-des-droits-de-l-homme-collectif-contre-l-islamophobie-en-France">overturned</a> [order, in French; <a href="http://www.conseil-etat.fr/Actualites/Communiques/Mesure-d-interdiction-des-tenues-regardees-comme-manifestant-de-maniere-ostensible-une-appartenance-religieuse-lors-de-la-baignade-et-sur-les-plages">press release</a>, in French] the ban on full-body "burkini" swimsuits in the French city of Cannes. The court held that imposing a burkini ban is an affront to "fundamental freedoms," including "freedom to come and go," and "freedom of conscience and personal liberty." A burkini is a full-bodied bathing suit primarily worn by Muslim women. Those in support of the burkini ban support their position claiming the garment is a means of "enslavement." Those in opposition of the ban, including Muslim leaders and French human rights supporters, believe the ban highlights the "thinly veiled institutionalized Islamophobia" within the nation. Earlier this month a court in Nice <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/french-court-upholds-ban-on-burkinis-in-cannes-due-to-islamic-symbolism.php">upheld the ban</a> [JURIST report] on burkinis, saying the ban is legal under a French law which prohibits activities disregarding public relations policies concerning religion.</p>

<p>Tensions in France have been high since an event in Nice last month in which more than 84 citizens were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">killed</a> [BBC report] by a truck that drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. The Islamic State (IS) has claimed <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-16/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-nice-attack/7635270">responsibility</a> [ABC News report] for the attack, which followed a call by IS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani for IS followers to kill non-believers in the West through any means possible. Four men believed to be connected to the attacked were <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/arrested-in-connection-with-nice-attack.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by authorities later in July. The Bastille Day attack is the second most deadly in a string of terrorist acts in France, including the November 13 Charlie Hebdo <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30717580">attacks</a> [BBC news archive], which claimed 130 lives, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36524094">murder</a> [BBC report] of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to IS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/151002p.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] a ban on non-commercial ads at Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) for violating the first First Amendment. The <a href="http://www.naacp.org/">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) [official website] challenged the practice as being a restriction upon the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. The NAACP filed suit after it was denied permission to put a sign up in the airport aimed at politicians for spending money on prisons and not public education. The city made an exception for the NAACP sign, but the city's policy reviewed nonetheless. Judge Thomas Ambro, who penned the majority opinion, stated the city's desire to maintain a "soothing and pleasing" environment in the PHL airport was not supported by this ban. In particular, he said the "broader effort apparently does not involve shielding travelers from noncommercial content on the ground that it might offend them," as they show political and other potentially disconcerting images outside of its advertisements, including through televisions and other media in the airport.</p>

<p>Attempts by state and federal governments to regulate the kind and location of advertising in public areas is not uncommon, though the Third Circuit's ruling is contrasted by other court's decisions to uphold advertising regulations. In 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2013/12/ninth-circuit-upholds-law-prohibiting-corporate-campaign-advertising-on-public-stations.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a federal law which banned corporate and campaign advertising on public radio and television. Five years prior, that same court <a href="/paperchase/2009/01/ninth-circuit-upholds-los-angeles.php">rejected</a> a First Amendment challenge to a Los Angeles city ban on billboards. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/sites/ncmd/files/opinions/16cv236moo.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] on Friday that the University of North Carolina (UNC) must allow transgender students to choose and use restrooms matching their gender identity at its campuses. The case was brought to court against North Carolina <a href="https://www.patmccrory.com/">Governor Patrick McCrory</a> [official website] and state legislators <a href="http://www.philberger.org/">Phil Berger</a> [official website] and Tim Moore by three plaintiffs who were represented by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website], challenging North Carolina <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/sessions/2015e2/bills/house/pdf/h2v4.pdf">House Bill No. 2</a> (HB2) [bill, PDF]. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-transgender-bathroom-north-carolina-20160826-snap-story.html">Two of the plaintiffs were transgender individuals</a> [LA Times report]. The challenge was only to part I of HB2, dubbed the "bathroom bill," that "requires public agencies to ensure that multiple occupancy bathrooms, showers, and other similar facilities are 'designated for and only used by' 2 persons based on their 'biological sex,' defined as the sex listed on their birth certificate." The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to block the enforcement of the bathroom bill portion of HB2, which Judge Thomas Schroeder granted, stating that: <blockquote>"Plaintiffs have made a clear showing that (1) they are likely to succeed on their claim that Part I violates <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix-education-amendments-1972">Title IX [of the Educational Amendments of 1972]</a> [statute, text], as interpreted by the United States Department of Education (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) under the standard articulated by the Fourth Circuit; (2) they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities weighs in favor of an injunction; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest."</blockquote>Based on the above conclusion, Schroeder enjoined UNC, and the state of North Carolina from enforcing part I of HB2 against the individual transgender plaintiffs until the court reaches a final decision on the merits in this case. However, Schroeder denied the preliminary injunction on the equal protection claim and reserved his ruling on the due process claim pending additional briefing from the parties. The court has given additional deadlines for briefs to be filed by the parties with a final deadline of October 7 for the last brief to be filed. </p>

<p>Transgender access to public restrooms has been a controversial topic and has created a wave of legislative and judicial actions. Earlier this month a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-transgender-bathroom-access-guidelines.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] federal guidelines that allowed transgender students to use the bathroom according to the gender with which they identify. Earlier this month the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-allowing-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a lower court ruling allowing a transgender student who identifies as male to use the boy's restroom at school.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, <a href="http://shaheedoniran.org/">Ahmed Shaheed</a> [official website], on Friday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20419&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] Iran to halt the execution of Alireza Madadpour and 11 other individuals convicted on drug related offenses. All 12 individuals were sentenced to death for drug offenses and recently transferred to solitary confinement in Karaj Central Prison. Madadpour was arrested in November 2011 when 990 grams of crystal meth were found during a raid in a house he cleaned. He was later convicted in July 2012 by the Karaj Revolutionary Court in a trial that lasted 20 minutes, and was never given the opportunity to meet with his defense lawyer. Madadpour's request for a pardon and retrial were denied. Shaheed expressed serious concern regarding Iran's' insistence on using drug-related executions as means to deter crimes and pointed out the open acknowledgement of Iran's own government officials concerning the ineffectiveness of executions in the prevention of drug-related crimes. Shaheed stated that:<blockquote>It is regrettable that the Government continues to proceed with executions for crimes that do not meet the threshold of the "most serious crimes" as required by international law, especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is State party. It is also troubling that courts continue to issue death sentences in trials that not only breach international fair trial standards but even domestic due process guarantees.</blockquote>Shaheed urged Iran to impose a moratorium on executions and restrict the use of the death penalty for the "most serious crimes."</p>

<p>Much international pressure has been directed toward Iran in recent years for its use of the death penalty. In March Shaheed expressed continued concern regarding Iran's alarming rate of <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-rate-of-juvenile-executions-in-iran.php">juvenile executions</a> [JURIST report] and other flaws in the justice system. In February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] criticized Iran's justice system after 40 men were <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-criticizes-iraq-over-death-sentences.php">sentenced to death</a> [JURIST report]. In January AI reported on the many <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ai-releases-report-on-death-row-juvelniles-in-iran.php">juvenile offenders on death row</a> [JURIST report] in Iran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Argentine federal court concluded a human rights trial on Thursday against military officers during the dictatorship era. The court in Córdoba, Argentina, <a href="http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1931464-megacausa-la-perla-condenan-a-prision-perpetua-a-menendez-y-los-cabecillas-de-la-represion-ilegal">acquitted</a> [La Nacion report, in Spanish] five defendants and sentenced 28 to life and 10 to between two-and-a-half and 21 years in prison. The trial <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/americas/argentina-trial-cordoba.html?_r=0">focused</a> [NYT report] on 20 cases from torture centers in Córdoba and involved 716 victims. It was the first time authorities were able to prosecute cases involving death squads that operated before the 1976-83 military dictatorship. The defendants were found guilty of torturing, murdering or stealing newborn babies. One defendant known as "The Hyena," General Luciando Menendez, was <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/argentine-court-sentences-28-to-life-in-prison-for-torturing-and-killing-political-opponents/a-19503928">found guilty</a> [DW report] of 52 homicides, 260 kidnappings, 656 instances of torture, and 82 disappearances of detainees. His nickname came from laughing while torturing his victims and is already serving eleven life sentences for his crimes.</p>

<p>Former participants of former dictatorship of South America have been held accountable for their past crimes in the last decade. In May Argentina's last dictator, Reynaldo Bignone, and other former military officers were <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/former-argentina-dictator-and-military-leaders-sentenced-to-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to prison for their roles in Operation Condor in the 1970s. In February, France's highest appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/france-high-court-stays-extradition-of-argentine-ex-police-officer.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] a lower court decision to seek the extradition of a former police officer to Argentina for alleged crimes against humanity during the country's "dirty war." In 2014 a federal judge in Argentina <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/argentina-judge-asks-spain-to-extradite-20-franco-era-spanish-officials.php">requested</a> [JURIST report] that Spain arrest and extradite 20 former Spanish officials suspected of human rights violations during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Also in 2014, a Buenos Aires court <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/argentina-ex-dictator-receives-additional-sentence.php">handed</a> [JURIST report] down a 23-year prison sentence to Bignone, the last Argentinian military president of the country's dictatorship, for the kidnapping and torture of 32 factory workers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The proposal would have transferred legislative <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/illinois-redistricting-referendum-wont-appear-on-ballot/2016/08/25/a688168c-6b2b-11e6-91cb-ecb5418830e9_story.html">mapmaking</a> [WP report] power to an independent commission and had the backing of approximately 563,000 signatures because many argue that the mapmaking process in the state is too political. Ballot initiatives may only be used for amendments directed at "structural and procedural subjects" that pertain to the state's legislative branch and the court <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-supreme-court-independent-map-ruling-met-0826-20160825-story.html">concluded</a> [<em>Chicago Tribune</em> report] that the proposal went beyond this narrow scope.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Last month, Michigan Attorney General spokesman John Sellek <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/michigan-to-appeal-decision-allowing-straight-ticket-voting.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette and Secretary of State Ruth Johnson plan to appeal an injunction on the state's law eliminating straight-ticket voting. Also last month, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Diane Larsen <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/cook-county-judge-blocks-illinois-redistricting-ballot-measure.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a ballot measure proposing an amendment to the Illinois Constitution that aimed to eliminate the General Assembly's power to draw legislative district boundaries. In June, a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/three-judge-panel-upholds-north-carolinas-newly-drawn-voting-districts.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's newly drawn congressional districts. In May, the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-lets-virginia-redistricting-decision-stand.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Republic congressmen from Virginias lack standing to appeal a decision regarding an election district plan for Virginia's Third Congressional District.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/rssExec.pl?Submit=Display&Path=Y2016/D08-26/C:16-3083:J:PerCuriam:aut:T:op:N:1817743:S:0">denied</a> [text, PDF] an emergency petition for a full <em>en banc</em> rehearing regarding the Wisconsin <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/26/politics/wisconsin-voter-id-ruling/">voter identification law</a> [CNN report]. A federal court in July decided that voters who do not have a required form of ID can vote through an <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/wisconsin-court-order-relaxes-voter-id-law-for-november-election.php">affidavit process</a> [JURIST report], a win for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/frank-v-walker-fighting-voter-suppression-wisconsin">filed the lawsuit</a> [ACLU backgrounder]. However, earlier this month the court of appeals <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/frank-v-walker-order-granting-stay">granted a stay</a> [text, PDF] allowing the requirements for voting ID to remain in place. The court of appeals denied the <em>en banc</em> hearing based on the state's assurances that a new rule will allow all eligible voters to receive the necessary ID for free through the DMV, notwithstanding the absence of identifying documents,</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.csj.gob.sv/idioma.html">Supreme Court of El Salvador</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Saturday ordered the release of three ex-military officers who had been jailed for killing six Jesuit priests during the country's civil war. In 1989 a team of about 20 military officers <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2016/08/27/el-salvador-frees-3-ex-military-officers-linked-to-18-killings/">stormed</a> [EFE report] the <a href="http://www.uca.edu.sv/">University of Central America</a> (UCA) [official website, in Spanish] and executed the priests as well as a housekeeper and her daughter. Since five of the priests were Spanish, the <a href="http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder-Judicial/Audiencia-Nacional/">Spanish National Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] claimed universal jurisdiction over the case and issued arrest warrants against the officers in 2011. Salvadoran officers did not act on the arrest warrants until February of this year. Though Spain requested that the arrested officers be extradited, the Supreme Court denied the request. The court further determined that a fourth jailed military officer will remain in custody due to the recent repeal of the country's amnesty law. Salvadoran authorities continue to search for 12 other accused officers who have yet to turn themselves in.</p>

<p>Last month the Supreme Court struck down the <a href="https://elliott.gwu.edu/sites/elliott.gwu.edu/files/downloads/acad/lahs/el-salvador-amnesty-2013.pdf">amnesty law of 1993</a> [backgrounder, PDF], opening the way for <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/el-salvador-supreme-court-strikes-down-amnesty-law.php">prosecution</a> [JURIST report] of those associated with various war crimes and crimes against humanity during the El Salvadoran civil war. This decision will allow El Salvador to follow suit with the US, which has made significant strides over the past decade in prosecuting those involved in the war. In 2011 the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2011/04/us-seeks-deportation-of-salvadoran-general-for-human-rights-crimes.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] General Eugenio Vides Casanova, former defense minister of El Salvador, for human rights crimes committed during the civil war while he served as the country's top military officer. The US was also seeking to <a href="http://www.lapagina.com.sv/nacionales/50168/2011/04/18/General-Vides-Casanova-podria-ser-deportado-de-EE-UU-acusado-de-tortura">deport</a> [La Página report, in Spanish] Vides, who retired in Florida after completing his six-year term as defense minister. Vides was successfully <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-deports-el-salvador-ex-general-tied-to-1980s-civil-war-rights-abuses.php">deported</a> [JURIST report] in 2015. In 2006 the <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit</a> [official website] upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2006/01/federal-appeals-court-reinstates-55m.php">$55 million verdict</a> [JURIST report] against Vides and his co-defendant Jose Guillermo Garcia for allowing torture and other human rights violations during the war. In 2005 a US federal court reached a verdict against Nicolas Carranza, top commander of El Salvador's security forces during the civil war, for <a href="/paperchase/2005/11/us-jury-finds-ex-salvadoran-colonel.php">$2 million in compensatory damages</a> [JURIST report]. The case was brought by five Salvadoran citizens who alleged torture or had family killed by Carranza's soldier during the war. In 2000, however, the US lost the battle to seek justice for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/world/2-salvador-generals-cleared-by-us-jury-in-nuns-deaths.html?ref=joseguillermogarcia">murders of four American churchwomen</a> [NYT report] during the civil war when both Vides and Garcia were acquitted. The ruling was grounded in the doctrine that the generals, although responsible for their soldiers, may not have had complete effective power to reign in the abuses of their troops.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/superiorcourts.htm">California Superior Court</a> [official website] on Friday rejected a <a href="https://lifelegaldefense.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/2016-0608-conformed-plaintiffs-ex-parte.pdf">challenge</a> [application, PDF] to the state's recently enacted physician-assisted suicide law. In June California passed the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB128">End of Life Option Act</a> [text] which would allow "terminally ill" patients to be <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/california-doctors-challenge-aid-in-dying-law.php">prescribed lethal drugs</a> [JURIST report] if their doctor has determined that they have less than six months to live. Following enactment, five physicians, the <a href="http://ethicalhealthcare.org/">American Academy of Medical Ethics</a> (AAME), and the <a href="https://lifelegaldefensefoundation.org/">Life Legal Defense Foundation</a> [official websites] requested that the law be immediately suspended since its vague definition for "terminally ill" patients subjects the law to abuse and may violate equal protection and due process rights. Judge Daniel Ottolia <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/california-judge-rejects-request-to-suspend-assisted-suicide-law.html">ruled</a> [<em>NYT</em> report] that the law will remain in effect, but he allowed the plaintiffs to proceed with their lawsuit concerning the lack of safeguards against abuse. Opponents have primarily accused the law of allowing the coercion of terminally ill patients. However, the attorney general's office have stressed that physicians may deny the administration of lethal drugs and that patients must be capable of independently administering the drugs. </p>

<p>The aid-in-dying movement has garnered substantial legal debate around the world in the past few years. In the US, four states currently have legislation that allow physicians to prescribe life-ending medication to some patients: California, Oregon, Washington and Vermont. In Montana the state's highest court has ruled that assisted suicide is not <a href="/paperchase/2010/01/montana-supreme-court-rules-physician.php">explicitly banned</a> [JURIST report] by state law or public policy, meaning consent could be raised as a defense in a potential prosecution of a physician. In July 2015 California lawmakers<a href="/paperchase/2015/07/california-lawmakers-drop-right-to-die-bill.php">ended a previous legislative effort</a> [JURIST report] to enact the End of Life Option Act, as the former right-to-die bill had been amended several times over the previous year. The law was hotly debated when 29-year-old <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/07/opinion/maynard-assisted-suicide-cancer-dignity/">Brittany Maynard</a> [CNN backgrounder] moved from San Francisco to Oregon, which allows physician-assisted suicide, so that she could die on her own terms after being diagnosed with brain cancer. In May 2015 a Dutch court <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/dutch-court-clears-man-who-assisted-in-dying-mothers-suicide.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] a man of all criminal charges for assisting his 99-year-old mother in committing suicide. Also that month, an 84-year old attorney, businessman and political candidate <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/terminally-ill-nashville-lawyer-challenges-tennessee-ban-on-assisted-suicide.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in Tennessee, challenging a law that makes it a felony for a doctor or another person to help someone commit suicide.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Venezuelan authorities on Saturday arrested a major opposition leader, Daniel Ceballos, stating that the arrest was to prevent his efforts at <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-37206563">destabilizing the country</a> [BBC report]. Ceballos, the former mayor of San Cristobal, was arrested in March 2014, accused of inciting violence during a wave of protests against the government. However, Ceballos was released and placed on house arrest last year for medical reasons. The opposition has claimed Ceballos is a political prisoner, arrested only to quiet dissent amid cries for recalling President Nicolas Maduro. Due to many issues in the country, the opposition has called for a march on the capital on September 1 to seek a referendum on the <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Venezuela-sends-opposition-leader-back-to-jail--expels-Ecuadoran-lawmakers">recall of Maduro</a> [AFP report].</p>

<p>Earlier this month a Venezuelan appeals court in Caracas upheld the more than 13-year <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/venezuela-court-upholds-sentence-of-opposition-leader.php">sentence</a> [JURIST report] of another opposition leader, Leopoldo López. The tension between the executive, legislative and judiciary branches of government in Venezuela has served as a hostile condition against López. In March Venezuela's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-legislature-passes-an-amnesty-for-dozen-of-jailed-dissidents.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amnesty law that would free 77 individuals allegedly jailed for political reasons under a number of crimes, including López, but Maduro has vowed to veto the law. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-chief-urges-protection-for-venezuela-opposition-after-assassination.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the protection of political opposition leaders associated with an assassinated Venezuelan opposition leader while he was on state with López's wife, Lilian Tintori. In October, a former Caracas prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/venezuela-prosecutor-opposition-leader-convicted-on-false-evidence.php">confessed</a> [JURIST report] to being pressured into presenting false evidence to condemn opposition leader López.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Egyptian human rights lawyer Malek Adly was released from prison Sunday following a Saturday decision by an Egyptian court. Adly had been <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/08/27/egypt-court-orders-release-lawyer-who-defied-president.html">held in solitary confinement</a> [AP report] for more than 100 days without a formal charge, and his incarceration was pinned on various administrative detention orders. Adly supporters claim that the lawyer's prosecution was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-36231986">due to an interview</a> [BBC backgrounder] in which he criticized an April decision by <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] to hand over two islands in the Red Sea to Saudi Arabia.   </p>

<p>Last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/egypt-saudi-arabia-sign-joint-security-agreement.php">Egypt and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement</a> [JURIST report] to improve stability and safety in the region, and Egypt gifted the two islands to Saudi Arabia as a symbol of good will. The agreement, entitled the "Cairo Declaration" and signed in Cairo by el-Sisi and Saudi Defense Minister and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, aims to boost military and social ties in the region, as well as improve economic stability. However, in June a <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/egypt-court-invalidates-transfer-of-islands-to-saudi-arabia.php">court in Cairo invalidated</a> [JURIST report] the Egyptian president's decision to give sovereignty over the two islands to Saudi Arabia. The relationship between the two countries has been improving since the ouster Islamist Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Saudi Arabia has in turn offered billions of dollars to aid Egypt in its joint bombing campaign with the Saudis against Yemen. The pact also sets out plans to build a new joint Arab military force to combat regional terrorism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] released <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/08/ukraine-authorities-must-commit-to-a-thorough-investigation-after-13-people-released-from-secret-detention/">statements</a> [AI statement; HRW <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/28/ukraine-new-research-corroborates-secret-detentions">statement</a>] Monday condemning Ukraine's use of secret facilities to detain individuals. The two groups released a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur50/4455/2016/en/">joint report</a> [report] earlier this summer detailing the use of torture in these secret detentions by both the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatists. Since the release of the report, 13 individuals have been released, but the rights groups estimate that five more individuals remain incarcerated and subject to inhumane treatment and have written a letter to the Chief Military Prosecutor <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur50/4719/2016/en/">urging him to release</a> [letter] the remaining prisoners.   </p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In July AI and HRW released the 56-page report detailing how Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in the Ukraine have subjected citizen to "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">refusing necessary medical attention</a> [JURIST report]. In June the UN human rights office reported that the human rights situation in <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ukraine-rights-violations-persist.php">Ukraine remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia. In February <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/russia-files-lawsuit-against-ukraine-over-3-billion-eurobond-debt.php">Russia filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Ukraine over Ukraine's default on $3 billion in bonds. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">plans to sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the International Court of Justice on claims of financing terrorism. Last August <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">a Russian military court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Ukrainian activists to substantial jail time for the charge of conspiring to commit terror attacks. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its policy of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">refusing to recognize Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/">Supreme Court of Pakistan</a> [official website] on Monday upheld the death sentences of 16 civilians convicted of terror-related offenses by military courts. The appellants contended that their constitutional rights had been violated, as they were tried in secret, without access to lawyers of their choice, and their confessions were recorded illegally. In addition, the appellants claimed to have been denied access to military court records in planning their appeal. The court, through a five-member bench, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-military-court-idUSKCN1140O4">concluded</a> [Reuters report] that the military had not violated the constitutional rights of the appellants, and further found that the military courts followed procedure. This decision is the first time the Pakistan Supreme Court has chosen to discuss the legality of a military-tried case. Since 2015, secret military tribunals have been used to convict 104 civilians, 100 of whom have been sentenced to death, and four to life imprisonment. </p>

<p>Pakistan's nine military courts were established in January of last year after Taliban militants attacked children in the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30505448">Peshawar school massacre</a> [BBC archive; JURIST <a href="h/paperchase/2014/12/un-rights-chief-condemns-savage-extremism-of-taliban-insurgents.php">report</a>], killing 134 students and 19 adults. Military power was subsequently expanded, giving military courts jurisdiction to try civilians accused of terrorism despite the country's civilian government. Critics argue that the new procedures defer too much power to the military. Allegations of torture and judicial abuse were widespread during the reign of previous Pakistani military courts. However, many Pakistanis support the military courts due to the crumbling civilian system. Pakistan's use of the death penalty since December 2014 in both the civilian and military courts has faced widespread criticism. When the country's six-year death penalty moratorium was <a href="/paperchase/2014/12/pakistan-pm-lifts-death-penalty-moratorium-following-deadly-attack.php">lifted</a> [JURIST report] that month, <a href="http://pmo.gov.pk/pm_profile.php">Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif</a> [official profile] said the death penalty would only be applied to terrorism-related cases. However, in March of last year the Pakistan Ministry of Interior lifted the country's moratorium on the death penalty, permitting hangings for <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/pakistan-lifts-6-year-death-penalty-moratorium.php">all prisoners</a> [JURIST report] who have exhausted all possible appeals. The UN estimates that several hundred of the 8,000 inmates on Pakistan's death row are <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-rights-experts-urge-pakistan-to-halt-postponed-execution-of-juvenile-offender.php">minors</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Australia: international tribunal has no jurisdiction in East Timor border dispute</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian officials on Monday said that a Hague-based international tribunal lacks jurisdiction to set a border between Australia and East Timor. East Timor <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-08-29/east-timor-australia-open-talks-on-maritime-border-dispute">invoked</a> [AP report] this "conciliation commission" in the hopes that it would put pressure on Australia to create a new, permanent maritime boundary between the two countries, giving more sea bed to East Timor than exists under current agreements with Australia. The practical effect of such a <a href="https://pcacases.com/web/view/37">decision</a> [case materials] would be to put a vast expanse of oil and gas reserves underneath the sea bed to the impoverished country. Australia's participation in the tribunal is required, but the tribunal's ruling is non-binding, a point which Australia has emphasized. Regardless of the tribunal's decision, Australia is not likely to comply, as it believes existing treaties between the two countries are in line with international guidelines, while fairly apportioning revenue and providing equitable opportunities to exploit the gas and oil reserves. Australia had played a quintessential role in helping East Timor to achieve independence from Indonesia, but, following claims in 2013 that Australia had previously bugged the East Timorese Cabinet leading to revenue-sharing negotiations, the relationship between the two has sullied. East Timor has asserted that, in light of this information, the <a href="http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/R_2003_2-Timor-Treaty.pdf">Timor Sea Treaty</a> [text, PDF] should be void for being negotiated in bad faith.</p>

<p>Last March the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/pm-malcolm-turnbull-disappoints-east-timor-on-talks-on-maritime-boundary-20160301-gn798f.html">agreed to have "frank and open" discussions</a> [SMH article] with East Timor in regards to the unresolved maritime border between the two countries, but would not agree to East Timor's request for more formal talks. East Timor believes that the current agreement between the two countries, which allows the two countries to share oil and gas revenues in a joint development area, is not reflective of their actual rights under international law. East Timor argues that if the boundary reflected the <a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">UN Convention of the Law of the Sea</a> (UNCLOS) [text, PDF], the vast majority of the oil and gas reserves - approximately $40 billion in royalties and taxes - would fall within its maritime border.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dilma Rousseff, the suspended president of Brazil, appeared before the Senate on Monday to make a final appeal to lawmakers before they vote on whether to remove her from office. In her <a href="http://g1.globo.com/politica/processo-de-impeachment-de-dilma/noticia/2016/08/veja-e-leia-integra-do-discurso-de-dilma-no-senado.html">speech</a> [text, in Portuguese], Dilma claimed she is innocent of the accusations against her and that the evidence against her is only a pretext to overthrow a legitimate government. She criticized the government of the acting president, Michel Temer, for ignoring women and minorities in the ministries. Further, she referred to her impeachment as unlawful, a misuse of power, and a blow to democracy and to social progress of the last 13 years. She also made references to the years she spent jailed under military rule. If lawmakers vote to remove Rousseff, Temer would <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-29/rousseff-says-impeachment-trial-amounts-to-her-death-penalty">finish the term</a> [Bloomberg report] as president.</p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigation and trials. Earlier this month, the Senate of Brazil officially <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/brazil-senate-votes-to-open-impeachment-trial-against-president.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] President Dilma Rousseff, marking the beginning of an impeachment trial against the embattled president. Also earlier this month, a Brazilian senate committee <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/brazil-senate-committee-votes-for-rousseff-impeachment-trial.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] 14-5 to continue impeachment proceedings against the suspended president who is charged with failing to "comply with tax and budget laws on the issues of additional credit decrees." Last month, a Brazilian judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-to-stand-trial-for-obstruction.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will stand trial for obstruction of justice. In June, the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-brazil-must-advance-business-and-human-rights.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Brazil must place more emphasis on remedying and preventing business-related human right violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN experts on environment and indigenous peoples rights on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20423&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] governments throughout the world to make human rights a priority in environmental conservation efforts, stating that protecting biodiversity is a human rights issue. The message comes days before the scheduled World Conservation Congress (WCC) in Honolulu, US, the largest global forum for adopting conservation policies. The experts expressed that it is important for indigenous people and environmentalists to join forces in protecting land and biodiversity, especially considering the number of conservationists and indigenous people who have been killed. Additionally, a loss of biodiversity, according to the experts, affects human rights as it negatively impacts the right to food, housing, culture, and other necessities. </p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples  and their relationship to the environment have become a pressing international legal topic in recent years. Earlier this month the Navajo Nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/navajo-nation-sues-epa-following-toxic-spill.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) alleging that water flowing from a punctured mine in Colorado was toxic and "damaged the Nation's environment, people, and economy." In 2014, a report by <a href="http://rightsandresources.org/en/">Rights and Resources</a> [advocacy website] warned of the growing pressure for land and resources that <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/report-urges-recognizing-land-rights-of-locals-could-be-cost-effective-protection-for-tropical-fores.php">threatens</a> [JURIST report] communities dependent on tropical forests. The <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf">UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a> [text, PDF], was adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 and "marked a historic moment of recognition of the existence of indigenous peoples" but UN experts said last year that implementing the Declaration would continue <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/un-indigenous-rights-expert-calls-for-greater-awareness-of-human-rights-values.php">to be a challenge</a> [JURIST report] without greater awareness.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former French president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11576712">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [BBC profile] stated to the press on Monday that he would amend the constitution to ban full-body "burkini" swimsuits if re-elected next April. His <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-religion-burqa-france-idUSKCN1130TW">comments</a> [Reuters report] came after a statement was made by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who said a ban on burkinis would be <a href="http://www.la-croix.com/France/Politique/Faire-emerger-un-islam-de-France-ancre-dans-les-valeurs-de-la-Republique-2016-08-28-1200785101">unconstitutional</a> [<em>La Croix</em> report, in French]. In response, Sarkozy said: "Well, then we change the constitution. We've changed it thirty odd times, it's not a problem." Earlier this week, France's highest administrative court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/france-court-overturns-burkini-swimsuit-ban.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the ban on burkinis. Also this month a court in Nice <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/french-court-upholds-ban-on-burkinis-in-cannes-due-to-islamic-symbolism.php">upheld the ban</a> [JURIST report] on burkinis, saying the ban is legal under a French law which prohibits activities disregarding public relations policies concerning religion.</p>

<p>Tensions in France have been high since an event in Nice last month in which more than 84 citizens were <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">killed</a> [BBC report] by a truck that drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. The Islamic State (IS) has claimed <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-16/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-nice-attack/7635270">responsibility</a> [ABC News report] for the attack, which followed a call by IS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani for IS followers to kill non-believers in the West through any means possible. Four men believed to be connected to the attacked were <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/arrested-in-connection-with-nice-attack.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by authorities later in July. The Bastille Day attack is the second most deadly in a string of terrorist acts in France, including the November 13 Charlie Hebdo <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30717580">attacks</a> [BBC news archive], which claimed 130 lives, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36524094">murder</a> [BBC report] of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to IS.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran <a href="http://shaheedoniran.org/">Ahmed Shaheed</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20425&LangID=E">expressed "outrage"</a> [press release] regarding Iran's execution of 12 people for drug-related charges on Saturday. The day before the execution, Shaheed had <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-expert-urges-iran-to-halt-execution-of-12-drug-offenders.php">publicly appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Iranian authorities not to proceed with the planned executions. He specifically noted that international law only allows capital punishment for the "most serious crimes" with an intentional killing, and after a fair trial respecting strict due process. However, these conditions were not met in this instance. "Combating drug trafficking, a serious concern in Iran, does not justify the use of the death penalty in drug-related cases," Shaheed said. "The execution of Mr. Madadpour and 11 others shows the Iranian authorities' complete disregard of its obligations under international human rights law and especially of international fair trial standards and due process guarantees." He renewed his plea to Iran to institute a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>

<p>Madadpour was arrested in November 2011 when 990 grams of crystal meth were found during a raid in a house he cleaned. He was later convicted in July 2012 by the Karaj Revolutionary Court in a trial that lasted 20 minutes, and was never given the opportunity to meet with his defense lawyer. Much international pressure has been directed toward Iran in recent years for its use of the death penalty.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A UN expert on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20422&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the participants of the upcoming 21st Century Panglong Conference in Myanmar to prioritize human rights in their discussions. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/MM/Pages/SRMyanmar.aspx">Yanghee Lee</a> [official profile], the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, noted that human rights are at the core of the conflicts in Myanmar and thus must be a focus in order to achieve the desired long-term peace. Lee also acknowledged the necessity of involvement by women, young people and civil organizations, as they have been and will be affected by the outcome of this peace conference. This is the first major peace conference since the National League for Democracy assumed power in March.</p>

<p>Human rights has been on the forefront of Myanmar's new democratic government since ending a decades-old military rule. The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] released a report in June stating that human rights abuses against the Rohingya in Myanmar may amount to <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-chief-myanmar-abuses-may-amount-to-crimes-against-humanity.php">crimes against humanity</a> [JURIST report]. Also in June UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] shock at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries; the government of Myanmar alone <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/myanmar-releases-46-underage-military-recruits.php">released</a> [JURIST report] 46 underage child recruits from the military in March as part of a UN join action plan made in 2012. In May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-myanmar-parliament-should-amend-proposed-public-assembly-law.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the Myanmar Parliament to reconsider a proposed law that they say has the advocacy organization says has the potential to limit free expression and peaceful assembly. Also in May US Secretary of State John Kerry offered support to Myanmar's newly democratic government and <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/kerry-urges-myanmar-to-promote-further-human-rights-reforms.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the country to push more democratic reform and address human rights issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/08/29/15-16585.pdf">dismissed</a> [text, PDF] a 2014 <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) [official website] case against <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&T Mobile</a> [corporate website], which took issue with AT&T's disclosures regarding the reduction of a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-lawsuit-ftc-idUSKCN1141R8">customer's data speed</a> [Reuters report]. The process, known as "data throttling," involves an Internet service provider (ISP) slowing data speed once customers reach a certain usage threshold. The FTC claimed AT&T was deceptive and did not notify customers that this would occur, alleging that speeds were reduced by almost 90 percent in some cases. However, the court of appeals found that these claims could not hold up under the FTC Act due to an exemption for "common carriers." The FTC expressed their dissatisfaction with the result but have not stated whether they will appeal.</p>

<p>The dismissal does not necessarily mean AT&T is in the clear. In June 2015 the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) [official website] proposed a <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/fcc-fines-att-for-false-advertising-of-internet-speeds.php">$100 million fine</a> [JURIST report] for AT&T's actions. AT&T challenged the fine, but it is not out of the question. More generally, the way ISPs manage customers' access speed is an issue the FCC began <a href="/feature/2015/04/net-neutrality---fcc-actions.php">addressing</a> within the last couple of years through <a href="/feature/2015/04/legal-conflict-over-net-neutrality.php">net neutrality regulations</a> [JURIST backgrounders]. In June the <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-net-neutrality-regulations.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] the net neutrality regulations designed to ensure an open Internet. JURIST Guest Columnist <a href="http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/hammond-allen/">Allen Hammond</a> [official profile] of the <a href="http://law.scu.edu/">Santa Clara Law School</a> [official website] discussed the recent net neutrality ruling and what it means for the <a href="/forum/2016/07/allen-hammond-third-times.php">future of the internet</a> [JURIST op-ed]. In November 2014 US President Barack Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/net-neutrality">said</a> [statement] that he strongly supports the concept of net neutrality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>European Commission orders Apple to pay billions to Ireland</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm">ruled</a> [press release] on Tuesday that Ireland may recover up to €13 billion from <a href="http://www.apple.com/about/">Apple</a> [corporate website] after the company benefited from undue tax breaks. The commission ruled the tax breaks were illegal based on EU law because the tax benefit meant that Apple paid less taxes to operate in the country than other businesses, resulting in an unfair economic advantage. The ruling is the result of an investigation going back to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=3_SA_38373">June 2014</a> [case summary]. The investigation found that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/05/21/business/apples-international-structure.html?ref=business&_r=0">structure</a> [NYT backgrounder] of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe was set up in a way that essentially allowed them not to pay taxes on their profits by allowing a head office that had no employees or daily business dealings to have responsibility for the profits.<blockquote>Member States cannot give tax benefits to selected companies&#8212;this is illegal under EU state aid rules. The Commission's investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014</blockquote>The actual amount of the recovery is still being determined based on the company's business dealings with other European entities.</p>

<p>The ruling is another setback for the communications company, which continues to face multiple legal issues. The Beijing Municipal High People's Court ruled in May that Xintong Tiandi (XT), a local leather goods retailer, can continue to use the phrase "iPhone" on its leather goods in a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/apple-loses-iphone-trademark-case-in-china.php">trademark case</a> [JURIST report]. The Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau ordered Apple to stop sale of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Beijing due to claims by Chinese regulators that Apple Inc. violated a patent held by a Chinese company <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/apple-ordered-to-stop-sale-of-iphone6-and-iphone-6-plus-in-beijing.php">in June</a>[JURIST report]. Apple agreed in July to a $25 million settlement with Network-1 Technologies to end a patent <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/apple-agrees-to-pay-25-million-settlement-in-patent-infringement-case.php">infringement claim</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Palestinian authorities are violating free speech rights by arresting and abusing dissenting activists and journalists,<a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/29/palestine-crackdown-journalists-activists">said</a> [press release] Monday. The report details five cases in Gaza and the West Bank where journalists and activists were arrested or detained by authorities due to their peaceful criticism of authorities. Activists also suggest that court proceedings are used as a means to harass them into silence as they are often delayed and rescheduled due to lack of witnesses, which requires their constant presence at the court. Some detainees claimed they were forced to sign documents promising not to critique the government without evidence while others maintained they were physically abused and harassed by authorities. <blockquote>In Gaza, Hamas authorities detained and intimidated an activist who criticized the government for failing to protect a man with a mental disability; a journalist who posted a photograph of a woman looking for food in a garbage bin; and a journalist who alleged medical malpractice at a public hospital after a newborn baby died. In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority (PA) arrested and charged activists and musicians who ridiculed Palestinian security forces for cooperating with Israel and accused the government of corruption. The offending statements were allegedly made in Facebook postings, graffiti, and rap songs.</blockquote>HRW has called on Palestine to disavow this crackdown on free speech and expression because it goes against their ratification of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention Against Torture and laws. The Palestinian authorities deny the accusations</p>

<p>Human rights continues to be an issue in Palestine due to the Isreali-Palestine conflict. In April an Israeli court convicted Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to a 50-day war in<a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php"> Gaza</a> [JURIST report]. In May the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, released closing remarks to its fifty-seventh session, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces against <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">Palestinians</a> [JURIST Report]. In July a report by Amnesty International called upon Palestinian and Israeli officials to address human rights violations committed by their <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-palestine-and-israel-officials-need-to-deal-with-war-crimes.php">forces</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/nweb/">Supreme Court of Bangladesh</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/resources/documents/983762_Criminal_Review_Petition_58_2016.pdf">denied</a> [judgment, PDF] the final appeal of Mir Quasem Ali, an opposition leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, and upheld his death sentence. Ali was sentenced to death in 2014 by the <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/">International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] for murder, confinement, torture and incitement to religious hatred during during the Bangladesh war of independence in 1971. The death sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court in March. UN humans rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-experts-urge-bangladesh-to-quash-death-sentence-imposed-on-opposition-leader.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Bangladesh to repeal the death sentence imposed upon Ali for failing to meet international standards on fair trial and due process for the imposition of the death penalty. Ali may now be executed at anytime following the ruling. </p>

<p>The ICTB, established in 2009 under the <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections_all.php?id=435">International Crimes Act</a> [text], is charged with investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence. During the conflict, more than 3 million people are believed to have died and thousands of women raped, but the Jamaat-e-Islami party insists it did not commit any war crimes. Human rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." Motiur Rahman Nizami was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangledesh-executes-islamist-leader-for-war-crimes.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in May for war crimes. Also in May, the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-4-to-death.php">sentenced four men to death</a> for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Iraqi militias are <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/08/30/iraq-militias-recruiting-children">recruiting</a> [HRW report] children from at least one civilian camp of displaced persons in the region of Kurdistan, according to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Tuesday. Witnesses reported that at least seven children were recruited as fighters on August 14 to combat the Islamic State (IS) forces. The Iraqi Security Forces are preparing to engage IS to drive them from the city of Mosul. HRW urged all sides of the conflict to demobilize any fighters under the age of 18 in order to comply with international law. IS has similarly recruited child soldiers. Last month HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-iraq-should-keep-abusive-militias-out-of-mosul-campaign.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Iraqi military commanders to prevent historically abusive militias from participating in the campaign to retake Mosul. </p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. In June a UN-mandated human rights inquiry reported that the IS has been committing <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-islamic-state-committing-genocide-against-yazidi-people.php">genocide</a> [JURIST report] against the Yazidi people, in addition to a carrying out a variety of other war crimes and human rights violations. Earlier this month the UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-report-details-terrible-atrocities-committed-by-isil-in-iraq.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a report detailing the atrocities committed by IS in Iraq. Also in August UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-islamic-state-continues-to-commit-genocide-in-northern-iraq.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] his concern for the human rights violations faced by the Yazidi minority in Northern Iraq, stating that actions of IS may amount to genocide. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="g/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that IS "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Also in March the US House of Representatives unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">passed a resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and calling for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/">New York Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/Decisions/2016/Aug16/91-92opn16-Decision.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Tuesday that the definition of "parent" under a section of the state's <a href="http://law.onecle.com/new-york/domestic-relations/DOM070_70.html">Domestic Relations Law</a> [S. 70, text] should be expanded, in a decision that will serve to better accommodate same-sex couples. Because the previous legal definition of a parent "has become unworkable when applied to increasingly varied familial relationships," the court determined that a non-biological, non-adoptive partner has standing to seek custody and visitation rights where the partner "shows by clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to conceive a child and raise the child together." The final decision as to whether those rights will be granted rests in the discretion of the court, which must determine the best interests of the child to make the determination. Because the couple in this particular case entered into a pre-conception agreement with one another and the biological parents to raise the child as co-parents, the court did not decide if a couple without such an agreement would fulfill this new legal standard and could establish standing.</p>

<p>Same-sex marriage and adoption rights remain in a state of legal uncertainty despite the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] last June that states must allow same-sex marriage and recognize same-sex marriages performed out of state. In May the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/alabama-supreme-court-vacates-ruling-refusing-to-recognize-same-sex-adoption.php">vacated</a> [JURIST report] its prior ruling refusing to recognize same-sex adoption from other states. In April a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-same-sex-adoption-ban.php">struck down</a> [JURIST] Mississippi's ban on adoption by same-sex partners. In December the Arkansas Supreme Court temporarily <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/arkansas-top-court-suspends-ruling-allowing-same-sex-couples-to-be-listed-as-birth-parents.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] lower court ruling allowing both partners in same-sex couples to be listed as the "birth parents" on birth certificates of their children.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/30/president-obama-grants-111-additional-commutations-most-commutations-granted-single">granted clemency</a> [press release] to 111 non-violent criminal offenders, including 35 federal offenders serving life sentences. These new grants of clemency bring Obama's total to 673, including 325 in the month of August alone. Mostly drug offenders, the commuted sentences are part of Obama's ongoing effort to reduce the size of the nation's prison population. At a news conference earlier this month, Obama <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/08/04/press-conference-president-after-meeting-national-security-officials">explained</a> [press release] the sentence excusals: "I thought it was very important for us to send a clear message that we believe in the principles behind criminal justice reform." A corollary to Obama's commutations, <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/issue/criminal-justice-reform-initiative/">various measures</a> [House Judiciary Committee backgrounder], seeking to reform the criminal justice system, are working their way through the legislature. </p>

<p>This is the latest effort of the Obama administration to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/criminal-justice-reform">encourage criminal justice reform efforts</a> [WH backgrounder]. Earlier this month Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/president-obama-grants-clemency-to-214.php">granted clemency</a> [JURIST report] to 214 federal inmates. In June the Obama administration <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/white-house-announces-plans-to-provide-state-and-federal-prisoners-grants-for-college-education.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a number of programs focused on better reintroducing released prisoners into the community. In January Obama <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/barack-obama-why-we-must-rethink-solitary-confinement/2016/01/25/29a361f2-c384-11e5-8965-0607e0e265ce_story.html?utm_term=.951747e950fa">ordered</a> [WP report] the Attorney General to review the use of solitary confinement. Conservative groups have <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2016/05/16/is-it-time-for-criminal-justice-reform-2-law-enforcement-groups-are-at-odds/">criticized</a> [Daily Signal report] Obama's efforts as harming law enforcement's abilities to "dismantle and disrupt drug trafficking organizations." Republicans have also insisted on requiring federal prosecutors to "prove that white-collar defendants acted knowingly to violate the law," but the administration and Democrats <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news-other-administration/268427-obama-met-with-grassley-goodlatte-on">maintain</a> [The Hill report] that those provisions would make it harder for the government to prosecute corporate crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.eg/home/">Egyptian Parliament</a> [official website, in Arabic] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.parliament.gov.eg/home/News_Show.aspx?frm=1454">passed</a> [report, in Arabic] a new law regulating church building, purportedly to support the nation's Christian minority. Church building has long been contentious in Egypt, where only a tenth of the nation's population of 90 million practices Christianity. Hardliners in the majority Muslim country traditionally oppose church building as a threat to what they call the country's "Islamic character." <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abdel-Fattah-al-Sisi">President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi</a> [Britannica backgrounder], supported by Egypt's Christians, heartened his supporters when he promised to help them escape what they characterize as a second-class status. Under the new law, Christians must apply to their local provincial governor to build, and the church is to be limited to a practical size, and by an interest in the preservation of public order. This leeway gives critics pause, as it "empowers the majority to decide whether the minority has the right to hold their religious practices," said Ishaq Ibrahim, researcher for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. The law ultimately passed with a two-thirds vote. </p>

<p>Egypt has long experienced political turmoil, partly to blame for the power-disparity between Christianity and Islam, even before el-Sisi ousted former-president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Earlier this month, Egypt's public prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/egypt-prosecutor-orders-arrests-in-wheat-corruption-investigation.php">issued an order</a> [JURIST report] for the arrest of 13 people accused of committing profiteering, forgery and embezzlement as part of a national wheat import scandal. In December Egypt's former Agriculture Minister was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/former-egypt-agriculture-minister-detained-for-courruption.php">detained</a> [JURIST report] after an investigation headed by the country's prosecutor revealed that the minister and others received bribes amounting to over USD $1 million. In July 2015 an Egyptian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/egypt-court-sentences-former-prime-minister-to-five-years-in-prison.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former prime minister Ahmed Nazif to five years in prison during a retrial graft charges. Nazif served during the presidency of Hosni Mubarak until the start of the Egyptian Uprising in 2011, and was convicted of using his position to make illicit gains in excess of 64 million Egyptian pounds, or approximately USD $8.2 million. In February 2015 the Cairo Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/egypt-court-clears-mubarak-officials-of-corruption.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Nazif and former minister of interior Habib el-Adly of all charges against them. Both defendants were charged with "squandering public funds and profiteering" after allegedly making an illegal deal with German Company UTSCH to sell license plates for higher than market value.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three German organizations, <a href="https://www.campact.de/">Campact</a>, <a href="https://www.foodwatch.org/en/homepage/">foodwatch</a> and <a href="https://www.mehr-demokratie.de/">Mehr Demokratie</a> [advocacy websites] submitted a complaint against the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/">Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agrement</a> (CETA) [materials] Wednesday to the <a href="http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/EN/Homepage/home_node.html">Federal Constitutional Court</a> [official website]. With more than 125,000 signatures, the activists claim the complaint to be the largest public suit in the nation's history. CETA is designed to eliminate tariffs and foster investments. In a <a href="https://www.foodwatch.org/en/press/latest-press-release-125047-people-against-ceta-30-08-2016/">press release</a> [text], foodwatch stated that the trade agreement, between the EU and Canada, violates Basic Law in four different respects. The complaint alleges that the agreement would create omnipotent committees and discriminatory investment courts, while bypassing due diligence and implementing provisional action without the consent of voters.  </p>

<p>The trade agreement between the EU and Canada was <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/canada-eu-reach-deal-on-free-trade-agreement.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] in 2013. At that point, CETA had been in negotiation for four years. The alliance would provide Canada with greater reach into the European market and eliminate as much as 98 percent of all tariffs. The EU has endorsed the notion that CETA will comply fully with European standards for workers and safety. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/CRPDIndex.aspx">UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [website] released a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20429&LangID=E">statement</a> [text] Tuesday that women with disabilities face discrimination and are often excluded from freely participating in society. The statement, aimed at member states that have ratified the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/ConventionRightsPersonsWithDisabilities.aspx">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [materials], urged empowerment for women with disabilities, so they may enjoy their fundamental rights. The committee has issued a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/GC.aspx">General Comment</a> [materials] to guide member states in structuring health, educational and employment opportunities to better serve this population. </p>

<p>The promotion of rights for persons with disabilities is a critical issue around the world. Earlier this month the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit against the state of Georgia alleging the "unnecessary <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/doj-sues-georgia-for-segregating-students-with-disabilities.php">segregation of persons with disabilities</a> in state programs, services, and activities" [JURIST report]. In April the advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) claimed France is <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-france-prisons-neglecting-inmates-mental-health.php">failing to provide adequate mental health care</a> [JURIST report] and appropriate conditions for prisoners with psychosocial disabilities. In 2015 HRW condemned the EU for refusing to take action to address <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/hrw-eu-failing-to-address-hungary-rule-of-law-concerns.php">Hungary's alleged problematic laws and practices regarding human rights</a> [JURIST report] since the European Commission enacted a "rule of law" measure [text, PDF] in March 2014. Hungary's problematic practices include limitations on the powers of the Constitutional court; restraints on media freedom; and restrictions on the rights of women, people with disabilities, religious groups and homeless people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A federal judge in Kansas <a href="https://ecf.ksd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2014cv3138-11">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lawsuit on Tuesday by a convicted killer who accused a county jail and its administrators of violating his religious rights. Inmate Eddie Gordon Sr. stated in 2014 in his handwritten lawsuit that he wasn't fed for 28 hours during Ramadan. Gordon also <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/08/30/judge-tosses-kansas-muslim-inmate-religious-rights-lawsuit.html">stated</a> [AP report] that on numerous occasions he was served cold and unacceptable meals close to prayer time, preventing him from eating before his fasting. Gordon was sentenced in October 2011 to 23 years in prison for intentional second-degree murder related to a November 2010 shooting in Topeka. During the time of this complaint, Gordon was being temporarily held in the Shawnee County Jail. Judge David Waxse dismissed Gordon's case after Gordon missed the court-imposed deadline to submit evidence that the alleged misconduct harmed him physically or intentionally interfered with his decision. Gordon had been given 30 days in March of last year in order to explain in writing why his lawsuit shouldn't be dismissed. He ultimately did not file an amended lawsuit until this April, almost a year after the deadline. In his ruling, Chief Judge J. Thomas Marten ruled last month that even if the court excused Gordon missing the deadline, his amendments "do not cure the deficiencies the court previously discussed," thereby making the amendment "futile."</p>

<p>The <a href="/hotline/2014/01/jurist-podcast-prison-reform.php">treatment of prisoners and prison reform</a> [JURIST podcast] has been a matter of ongoing concern in the US.  In June a lawsuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/lawsuit-accuses-louisiana-judge-of-running-debtors-prison.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] a Louisiana judge of running a debtors' prison.  In March the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-courts-should-stop-jailing-defendants-for-failure-to-pay-fines.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] state court systems to stop using procedural routines and hefty fines to profit off poor defendants. In February the Supreme Court of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/california-supreme-court-rules-governor-can-move-forward-with-prison-overcrowding-ballot-measure.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Governor Jerry Brown can put his plan to ease prison overcrowding on the ballot this November. In January the US Supreme Court ruled that a landmark decision banning mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles should <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-ruling-against-mandatory-juvenile-life-sentences-applies-retroactively.php">apply retroactively</a> [JURIST report]. In August the Department of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/doj-reaches-settlement-with-la-prisons-on-mentally-ill-inmate-care.php">reached a settlement</a> [JURIST report] with Los Angeles prisons on mentally ill inmate care. In May of last year Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/hrw-us-prisons-using-excessive-force-on-mentally-disabled-prisoners.php">release</a> [JURIST report] a report stating that mentally disabled prisoners experience "unnecessary, excessive, and even malicious force" at the hands of prison staff across the US. A federal court in February 2015 <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/arizona-reaches-settlement-in-prisoner-healthcare-case.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a settlement agreement between the Arizona Department of Corrections and the American Civil Liberties Union in a class action lawsuit over the health care system within Arizona prisons. Also last February rights group Equal Justice Under Law <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/missouri-towns-sued-over-debtors-prisons.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against the cities of Ferguson and Jennings, Missouri, for their practice of jailing citizens who fail to pay debts owed to the city for minor offenses and traffic tickets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan's Interior Ministry said Wednesday that the country has requested that Britain take action against a former party leader who delivered a speech last week that ignited rioting in Karachi. Pakistan's Interior Ministry <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/08/31/world/asia/ap-as-pakistan-uk.html">sent a report</a> [NYT report] on <a href="http://www.mqm.org/quaid/quaid-page-1.htm">Altaf Hussain</a> [official profile] to British authorities on Tuesday, alleging that the self-exiled party leader had incited violence and disturbed law and order. Altaf Hussain is a British national and founder of the Muttahida Quami movement (MQM), which is a secular party representing ethnic Mohajirs, who fled to Pakistan from India during the 1947 partition. Hussain delivered an anti-government message last week via telephone to his supporters.  This speech resulted in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37159727">rioting</a> [BBC report] and the chanting of "Down with Pakistan." More than 45 leaders and supporters have been detained and numerous offices have been demolished. The party leadership in Pakistan has disassociated itself from Hussain and promised the party will no longer be run from London, where Hussain has lived in self-imposed exile.</p>

<p>The Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) has found itself in trouble in the international community on numerous occasions.  In August 2015 the party was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33883959">forced to resign</a> [BBC report] from the government position as a result of a "crackdown" on the party after numerous violent actions.  In June 2014 UK police <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36486970">obtained documents</a> [BBC report] that linked the MQM to numerous London bank account after the party was being investigated for money-laundering.  In March 2014 the Pakistani High Court of Sindh Karachi <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/pakistan-court-sentences-6-for-murder-of-journalist.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] six men associated with the MQM for the murder of a prominent TV journalist.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of UN experts on Wednesday<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20435&LangID=E">urged authorities</a> [press release] in Sudan to drop death penalty charges against six members of the Khartoum Center for Training and Human Development (TRACKS). The members were arrested a few months ago for criminal conspiracy, undermining the constitutional system, waging war against the state, espionage and terrorism. They have not yet faced trial, but the charges all possess the maximum penalty of death. According to the experts, the arrests and charges appear to be directly linked to TRACKS work with human rights defense, after a series of office raids, previous detainments, and questioning involving torture. The experts have raised their concerns at previous times, but point out that Sudan has signed onto international law that recognizes the freedom of expression and freedom of association. The group hopes that, at a minimum, the most stringent due process guarantees are enforced.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue worldwide. Earlier this week a UN rights expert  <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-expert-condemns-iran-execution-of-12-drug-offenders.php">expressed "outrage"</a> [JURIST report] regarding Iran's execution of 12 people for drug-related charges. Last month Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">approve reinstating the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly. In May a spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-condemns-iran-sentencing-of-human-rights-activist.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iranian authorities for the sentencing of Nargis Mohammadi, an anti-death penalty activist. Also in May UN rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-chief-welcomes-pfizer-measures-to-prevent-use-of-drugs-for-executions.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the measures being taken by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to prevent the use of its drugs in state-sponsored execution by lethal injection. UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-condemn-belarus-use-of-death-penalty.php">human rights experts expressed</a> [JURIST report] grave concern earlier that month over Belarus' death penalty practices after reports surfaced that a man was executed while his case was before the UN Human Rights Committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official circuit] <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/BB0AEFF8F39D55678525801F004F51B5/$file/15-1023-1632743.pdf">refused</a> [text, PDF] Wednesday to halt the military trial of the suspect charged with orchestrating the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, which killed 17 <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d919817eacae41a4a14a85cb946808f8/appeals-court-refuses-halt-trial-uss-cole-attack">US Navy sailors</a> [AP report]. Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri was captured in 2002 and has been held in secret prisons and Guantanamo Bay ever since, where he allegedly faced multiple forms of torture during interrogation. He argued that his case should be tried in a US court rather than by a military commission, not only because a military commission might aggravate him psychologically, but he fears he may not receive a fair hearing from the same entity that put him through such harm. However, the court of appeals, in a 2-1 decision, determined that the facts of his detainment do not give reason to believe he will receive an unfair hearing. The court also stated that the military commission is more than capable to determine whether al-Nashiri was captured outside the context of hostilities.</p>

<p>The proceedings surrounding the prosecution of the <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15&search=uss+cole+bombing&limit=25&page=2&author=242&limit_by_date=&date_range_start=&date_range_end=&filtered=&narrow=&authored=">USS Cole bombing</a> [JURIST news archive] have given rise to numerous due process concerns. In September 2015 the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/federal-appeals-court-orders-release-of-sudan-funds-for-uss-cole-bombing-victims.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the release of Sudanese funds held by New York banks to satisfy a $315 million default judgment in the USS Cole case. In 2007 alleged al-Nashiri declared that his confession to orchestrating the USS Cole bombing was <a href="/paperchase/2007/03/guantanamo-detainee-says-torture.php">elicited under torture</a> [JURIST report]. Nashiri made his <a href="/paperchase/2011/11/alleged-uss-cole-bomber-makes-first-court-appearance.php">first court appearance</a> [JURIST report] in November 2011 after he was captured in Dubai in 2002. Nashiri is charged with war crimes relating to the bombing of the USS Cole, the bombing of the MV Limburg in 2002 and a failed plot to attack an American warship, The Sullivans, in 2000. In March of last year a US military judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/military-judge-rules-medical-care-adequate-for-uss-cole-bomber-to-stand-trial.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the medical care provided to al-Nashiri by authorities at the Guantanamo Bay detention center was adequate.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/083116zr_7lh8.pdf">denied a motion to reinstate</a> [order, PDF] North Carolina's recently overturned law that limited early voting to 10 days and required voters to present approved identification cards. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-portions-of-north-carolina-voting-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] portions of the law upon finding discriminatory intent primarily concerning black state residents. Earlier this month the appeals court also <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-reconsider-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] the state's motion to stay the court's order pending appeal to the Supreme Court. The four conservative justices would have granted the stay. Since the state law will remain overturned, early voting will continue to last for 17 days. Furthermore, the law's provisions eliminating same day early voting registration, the counting of ballots by voters away from their home precinct, and the voting preregristation program for residents under 18 will not take effect. </p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Last week the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-reconsider-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an emergency petition for a rehearing regarding the Wisconsin voter ID law.  The Illinois Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/illinois-supreme-court-blocks-redistricting-proposal-from-ballot.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] last week that placing a redistricting proposal on the ballot this fall would be unconstitutional. Earlier this month an Oklahoma County judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld a controversial voter identification law </a> [JURIST report] allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. Last month voter restrictions were overturned not only in North Carolina, but in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports]. Also last month Michigan Attorney General spokesman John Sellek <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/michigan-to-appeal-decision-allowing-straight-ticket-voting.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette and Secretary of State Ruth Johnson plan to appeal an injunction on the state's law eliminating straight-ticket voting. Also Cook County Circuit Court Judge Diane Larsen <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/cook-county-judge-blocks-illinois-redistricting-ballot-measure.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a ballot measure proposing an amendment to the Illinois Constitution that aimed to eliminate the General Assembly's power to draw legislative district boundaries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/opinions/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that the federal ban against selling guns to medical marijuana card holders does not violate Second Amendment rights. The court <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/08/31/appeals-court-upholds-ban-on-gun-sales-to-medical-marijuana-card-holders.html">rejected</a> [AP report] the legal challenge from Nevada by a vote of 3-0 upon a finding that medical marijuana is still prohibited by federal law and may impair the judgement of gun owners. The court further supported the stance by the <a href="https://www.atf.gov/">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a> (ATF) [official website] that firearms dealers have reasonable cause to believe that medical card holders likely use unlawful drugs and are therefore justified in denying them sale. The court's ruling will apply to all nine states in the Ninth Circuit including California and Washington. </p>

<p>Gun control and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.nj2as.org/">New Jersey Second Amendment Society</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/second-amendment-group-challenging-stun-gun-ban.php">filed </a>[JURIST report] a lawsuit against the state's Attorney General in New Jersey's district court alleging the state's stun gun ban is unconstitutional. In June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-upholds-firearm-prohibitions-for-reckless-domestic-violence.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law conviction on reckless domestic assault is sufficient to bar possession of a firearm under federal law. Earlier in June Hawaii Governor David Ige <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/hawaii-governor-signs-bill-to-put-gun-owners-on-fbi-database.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring gun owners to be listed on an FBI database, notifying police if a Hawaii citizen is arrested in another state and providing a continuous criminal record check on those individuals seeking to possess a firearm. Also in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-assault-weapons-bans.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases challenging bans on assault-style weapons. The court denied the appeals without comment, letting stand lower court rulings that had <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld the bans</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional. In response to the mass killing in Orlando in June, the UN's top human rights official <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-chief-calls-for-increased-gun-control-in-us.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its gun control measures. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-authorities-may-require-permits-for-concealed-handguns-in-public.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in June that the right to carry a concealed gun is not within Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Brazilian President <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/br-profile-leader-idUSN2427652420130312">Dilma Rousseff</a> [Reuters profile] was <a href="http://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/materias/2016/08/31/um-ano-e-oito-meses-depois-de-empossada-dilma-rousseff-deixa-o-poder">removed from office</a> [press release, in Portuguese] on Wednesday following a 61-81 <a href="http://www12.senado.leg.br/hpsenado">Senate</a> [official website, in Portuguese] vote in favor of impeachment. The impeachment trial lasted five days, including an overnight debate. While Rousseff was impeached, the Senate decided to allow her to run for public office in the future. Shortly after the decision, Rousseff took to <a href="https://twitter.com/dilmabr">Twitter</a> [official profile, in Portuguese], proclaiming her innocence and describing the impeachment as a "coup," saying that it was racist, misogynist and homophobic.</p>

<p>During her suspension, Rousseff made an <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/suspended-Brazil-president-makes-final-appeal-to-lawmakers-befo<a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-to-stand-trial-for-obstruction.php"></a>re-impeachment-vote.php">impassioned speech</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday, in which she claimed she was innocent of the accusations against her and that the evidence against her is only a pretext to overthrow a legitimate government. Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigation and trials. Earlier this month the Senate of Brazil officially <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/brazil-senate-votes-to-open-impeachment-trial-against-president.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] Rousseff, marking the beginning of an impeachment trial against the embattled president. Rousseff's opposition <a target="_blank" href="/paperchase/2016/04/ht/paperchase/2016/03/brazils-president-decides-to-sue-senator-who-accused-her-of-corruption.php">claimed</a> [JURIST report] that she doctored documents to hide the size of the national deficit in order to spend more government funds as her re-election neared. It is also believed she continued to forge documents in her second term and spent over USD $210 million without the legislature's approval. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56f0249b-7c43-402f-b2b9-ce62ce5bad4b/1/doc/15-3135_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/56f0249b-7c43-402f-b2b9-ce62ce5bad4b/1/hilite/">voided</a> [text, PDF] a $655 million judgment against Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority Wednesday, citing a lack of jurisdiction. The case concerned 11 US families who claimed that the defendants used terrorists to kill their family members in Israel. While the lower court concluded, following a seven-week trial, that the defendants "acting through their employees, perpetrated the attacks and ... knowingly provided material support to organizations designated by the United States State Department as foreign terrorist organizations," the court of appeals found no basis for personal or specific jurisdiction allowing them to uphold the ruling. The court held that:<blockquote>The federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process clause of the Constitution, no matter how horrendous the underlying attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs&#8217; claims.The district court could not constitutionally exercise either general or specific personal jurisdiction over the defendants in this case. Accordingly, this case must be dismissed.</blockquote>Claims of human rights abuses continue to be an issue in Palestine due to the Isreali-Palestine conflict. On Monday Palestinian authorities were <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/human-rights-watch-accuses-palestine-of-free-speech-violations--dnp.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] of violating free speech rights by arresting and abusing dissenting activists and journalists by Human Rights Watch. In April an Israeli court convicted Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">50-day war in Gaza</a> [JURIST report]. In May the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, released closing remarks to its fifty-seventh session, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">against Palestinians</a> [JURIST Report]. In July a report by Amnesty International called upon Palestinian and Israeli officials to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-palestine-and-israel-officials-need-to-deal-with-war-crimes.php">address human rights violations committed by their forces</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human Rights organizations on Thursday <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/01/cluster-munitions-fewer-stockpiles-new-use">claimed</a> [press release] mounting evidence shows Russia is behind the increasing number of cluster bombings in Syria. The accusations were levied as part of the annual <a href="http://www.the-monitor.org/media/2369797/Cluster-Munition-Monitor-2016.pdf">Cluster Munition Monitor report</a> [text, PDF] which found that Syrian government forces used 13 types of cluster munitions in more than 300 attacks. The cluster munition report maintains that civilians instead of opposing forces are often killed or harmed during munition usage as some of the bombs have delayed detonation devices, making them landmines.The report claims that not only are most of the munitions manufactured by Russia but also the spike in their usage did not occur until after the joint Russian-Syrian partnership of September 2015.<blockquote>Russia has denied using cluster munitions in Syria since beginning its joint military operation with Syrian government forces on 30 September 2015, but its response is unconvincing. There is growing evidence that Russia stockpiles cluster munitions at its airbase at Hmeymim, southeast of Latakia City in Syria. There is compelling evidence that Russia is using cluster munitions in Syria and/or directly participating with Syrian government forces in attacks using cluster munitions on opposition-held areas of governorates such as Aleppo, Homs, and Idlib, and on armed opposition groups.</blockquote>The groups seek to end the usage of munition weapons by creating international awareness about their deadly effects. </p>

<p>The use of munition weapons in times of conflict continues to be issue of debate. Human Rights Watch (HRW) <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] in July that Russian and Syrian forces are using cluster bombs to target civilians and rebels in the northern portions of Syria. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in January warned that the use of cluster bombs by a Saudi-led coalition against neighborhoods in Yemen may amount to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-use-of-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-may-be-war-crime.php">war crime</a> [JURIST report]. In December Guest Columnist Bonnie Docherty of Human Rights Watch discussed the lack of legal oversight that allows for munition weapons continuous use despite their impact on <a href="/hotline/2015/12/bonnie-docherty-incendiary-weapons.php">civilian lives</a> [JURIST backgrounder]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN rights experts on Thursday<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20437&LangID=E"> called</a> [press release] for the creation of inclusive education programming to include those living with disabilities as a central and crucial step in order to create peaceful and inclusive societies. The call comes in the new and improved <a href="http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [text], which seeks to ensure that those living with disabilities are not forgotten and ignored by society. The UN experts are calling on an educational transformation as they have found that million of persons with disabilities are being denied access to education and as a result of that discrimination they are are often placed in vulnerable positions in society.<blockquote>Recognizing also that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person, Recognizing further the diversity of persons with disabilities, Recognizing the need to promote and protect the human rights of all persons with disabilities, including those who require more intensive support, Concerned that, despite these various instruments and undertakings, persons with disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society and violations of their human rights in all parts of the world</blockquote>The convention calls on states to create better and inclusive education systems to ensure all individuals are able to receive a proper education. </p>

<p>The rights of persons with disabilities is a global issue. The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities released a statement Tuesday that women with disabilities face discrimination and are often excluded from freely <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-experts-women-with-disabilities-should-be-empowered.php">participating in society</a> [JURIST report. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit against Georgia in August alleging that the state discriminates against students with behavior-related<a href="/paperchase/2016/08/doj-sues-georgia-for-segregating-students-with-disabilities.php"> disabilities</a> [JURIST report]. The DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/usdoj-and-fort-worth-agree-to-settle-disability-discrimination-lawsuit.php">announced </a> [JURIST report] in March that the city of Forth Worth, Texas has agreed to settle a lawsuit alleging that it discriminated against persons with disabilities by refusing to allow a group home for individuals recovering from drug and alcohol addiction to operate in a single family residential zone in the city. Last October, Human Rights Watch (HRW) sent Moroccan officials a letter claiming that a draft framework law before the country's parliament is in conflict with obligations to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/morocco-draft-law-in-conflict-with-un-treaty-on-disabilities.php">Disabilities</a> [JURIST report]</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a> (ACCC) [official website] <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-takes-action-against-volkswagen-over-diesel-emission-claims">sued</a> [press release] Volkswagen AG (VW) and its local subsidiary on Thursday for misleading customers. The suit alleges that VW engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, made false or misleading representations and engaged in conduct liable to mislead the public in relation to diesel vehicle emission claims. Specifically, the ACCC claims that between 2011 and 2015 VW misled customers in relation to the significantly higher nitrogen oxide emissions being produced by the vehicles, misled customers to believe that the vehicles complied with Australian and European standards and all Australian regulatory requirements, and marketed the vehicles in Australia as being environmentally friendly, clean burning, low emission and compliant with stringent European standards when this was not the case under normal driving conditions. The ACCC claims that this constituted multiple breaches of the <a href="http://consumerlaw.gov.au/the-australian-consumer-law/legislation/">Australian Consumer Law</a> [legislative documents]. The ACCC is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalties, corrective advertising, findings of fact and costs. </p>

<p>VW is facing legal difficulty around the world over the emissions scandal. In August a district court in Germany, <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/germany-court-lawsuits-against-volkswagen-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a collective complaint against VW may move forward. Like US-style class-action lawsuits, the collective complaint was launched on behalf of multiple investors who lost money following the diesel emissions cheating scandal. In July, a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-volkswagen-settlement.php">gave preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to a $15 billion settlement between VW and the US Environmental Protection Agency, California officials and consumers. In June VW <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/volkswagen-settles-over-allegations-of-cheating-emissions-tests-and-deceiving-customers.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to spend up to $14.7 billion to settle allegations of cheating emissions tests and deceiving customers in a settlement with US regulators. In March the Federal Trade Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ftc-sues-volkswagon-for-false-advertising.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against VW for false advertising.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.azcourts.gov/AZ-Supreme-Court">Arizona Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="https://ardp.org/ardp-responds-supreme-court-ruling-keep-proposition-205-ballot/">rejected</a> [press release] the final challenge to a voter initiated act to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The challenge came from a group called the <a href="https://ardp.org/">Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy</a> [advocacy website] and was <a href="https://www.regulatemarijuanainarizona.org/judge-rules-opponents-arizona-marijuana-initiative-confirms-prop-205-rightfully-placed-november-ballot/">dismissed in a lower court</a> [press release] after the judge found that the group did not have a right to sue. The <a href="https://www.regulatemarijuanainarizona.org/">Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol</a> [advocacy website] group gathered 258,000 signatures in support of the initiative, and the Supreme Court judge agreed that the measure could be included on the Arizona ballot. <a href="https://www.regulatemarijuanainarizona.org/full-initiative-text/">Proposition 205</a> [text] will now be on the ballot in November, and if passed, the measure will allow adults 21 and older to carry up to one ounce of marijuana and consume it privately. Adults may also cultivate up to six marijuana plants in an enclosed space and possess the marijuana produced by the plants. The opposing groups are now campaigning for yes and no votes for the upcoming ballot.</p>

<p>In the US, the legal use and sale of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes remains a controversial issue, with a number of states contemplating various legalization initiatives. In April Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/pennsylvania-governor-establishes-statewide-medical-marijuana-program.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] legalizing medical marijuana. In March the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-challenge-to-colorado-marijuana-law.php">declined to hear</a> [JURIST report] a case brought by Nebraska and Oklahoma against Colorado, challenging its marijuana laws. In November 2014 voters in Alaska, Oregon and Washington, DC <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/residents-in-alaska-oregon-dc-vote-to-legalize-marijuana.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to legalize recreational marijuana.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rights coalition North Carolinians for Privacy on Wednesday dropped their case against the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] challenging the federal government's restroom access policy. The case, <a href="http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PA-NC-0005-0001.pdf">North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States Department of Justice</a> [complaint, PDF] had been filed against the DOJ after the department threatened to cut off federal funding to the state and public schools unless individuals are allowed to use the bathroom according to the gender with which they identify. The case is one of several surrounding North Carolina's law that requires people to use the restroom according to their birth gender and limits other anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. </p>

<p>Privacy rights and individual rights have come into conflict lately over the issue of transgender access to restrooms. Last month a judge for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-transgender-bathroom-access-guidelines.php">US District Court for the Northern District of Texas temporarily blocked</a> [JURIST report] federal guidelines that allowed transgender students to use the bathroom according to the gender with which they identify. Also in August the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/supreme-court-blocks-ruling-allowing-transgender-student-to-use-boys-restroom.php">US Supreme Court granted</a> [JURIST report] an application to recall and stay lower court orders allowing a transgender student who identities as a male to use the men's restroom in school. In May, officials in 11 states filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/11-states-sue-obama-administration-over-transgender-guidance-letter.php">challenging the Obama administration's</a> [JURIST report] recent guidance letter on transgender students.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-judge panel of the New Jersey Appellate Division <a href="http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/a2393-13.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that when asked for public records under New Jersey's Sunshine Law, agencies may "neither confirm nor deny" their existence. The case centered around a state law, similar to the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), called the Open Public Record Act (OPRA). In 2013, a member of the North Jersey Media Group had requested documents under the OPRA relating to <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/media-companies-begin-appeal-of-n-j-public-records-ruling-1.1457305">911 calls and complaints regarding a catholic priest</a> [North Jersey Media report]. The only other state that authorizes such a response is Indiana, which did so via statute.</p>

<p>Freedom of Information and governmental transparency has been a controversial topic in the last several years, most famously brought to the public eye through the actions of <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=edward%20snowden&IncludeBlogs=2,5,4,6,21,15">Edward Snowden</a> [JURIST archive]. <a href="http://www.state.nj.us/grc/act.html">OPRA</a> [text] was established in 2002 and operates a system whereby a New Jersey citizen may submit requests for public documents, operating on a state level very similarly as FOIA does nationally. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/amended-foia-redlined-2010.pdf">FOIA</a> [text] was passed in 1966 under President Lyndon Johnson and has been repeatedly updated by Congress through amendments. The purpose of the act is to provide government documents and materials to the public upon a valid request, but it has come under criticism throughout the years for being <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/federal-circuit-rules-on-freedom-of-information-act-procedure.php">overly burdened and sluggish in producing documents</a> [JURIST report]. Upon his first full day in office, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum dictating that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/FreedomofInformationAct">"[t]he Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails"</a> [official memorandum].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A reporter <a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/files/1514/7265/4483/McDaniel_complaint_083116.pdf">sued</a> [complaint, PDF] Missouri's prisons chief in federal court on Wednesday for excluding him from being an execution witness. The <a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocate website] filed the lawsuit on behalf of <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrismcdaniel">Christopher McDaniel</a> [profile], a reporter whose stories have been critical of Missouri's death penalty procedures. The suit <a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/newsviews/2016/08/31/aclu-missouri-sues-state-corrections-department-over-selecti">asks</a> [press release] a judge to block anyone other than Missouri's attorney general from serving as an execution witness until McDaniel's due-process claims are decided. McDaniel applied in January 2014 to witness a Missouri execution. He has stated he wants to "ensure that executions are carried out in a constitutional manner." McDaniel has yet to receive a response to his request, while 17 executions have been carried out by the state. The Missouri Department of Corrections <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ebe6dfe280c24f02ba95e6623aaf410a/reporter-sues-over-missouris-picks-execution-witnesses">has "unfettered discretion"</a> [AP report] in deciding who may be among the at least "eight reputable citizens" to witness an execution. The ACLU alleges that records they obtained show that applicants to be execution witnesses were denied "if they expressed a desire to ensure that executions were carried out properly and constitutionally."</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. Last month the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-blocks-alabama-execution.php">upheld a stay</a> [JURIST report] of execution for Alabama inmate Vernon Madison. A few days before that a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/miami-judge-florida-death-penalty-law-unconstitutional.php">Miami judge ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida's revamped death penalty law is unconstitutional because it does not require a unanimous agreement among jurors to approve executions. In April Virginia's General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. In February the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">approve the firing squad, electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if lethal injection drugs become unavailable</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/gabon-security-forces-must-stop-using-excessive-force-amid-postelection-tension/">report</a> [text] by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] Thursday condemned <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13376333">Gabon</a> [BBC profile] security forces for using excessive force against protesters after the country's disputed election. Alioune Tine, AI's West and Central Africa director, stated that these actions must stop after reports that several anti-government demonstrators had been shot and injured on Wednesday. Tine stated that "such a brutal response violates protesters' rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly." Tine asked that security forces do everything they can to allow for peaceful protests and impartially investigate any excessive use of force by the security forces. By doing so, Tine stated that such actions will assist in bringing stability and security after the election period. These actions result after incumbent <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13376335">President Ali Bongo Ondimba</a> [BBC profile] received 49.8 percent of the vote against 48.23 percent for rival <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/who-jean-ping-gabons-presidential-challenger-494551">Jean Ping</a> [NEWSWEEK profile]. Ping'ss supporters are claiming that the results are fraudulent and has challenged the election. As a result, demonstrations have broken out in which <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37236253">at least two people were killed and several others were wounded by security forces</a> [BBC report].  The security forces claim that their actions were justified in response to "armed criminals who allegedly set fire to the country's parliament" earlier that day.</p>

<p>Ping claims the election was fraudulent and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37252778">cites results</a> [BBC report] in President Bongo's home province. In Haut-Ogooue, the voter turnout was 99.93 percent, and 95 percent of those votes were for the president. Other provinces had a turnout between 45 percent and 71 percent. As a result of the election, protests began in Gabon where protesters attacked the national assembly building. As a response police use tear gas and arrested hundreds that emerged from the building. Ping claims that his headquarters were bombed by security forces killing at least two people.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN said on Thursday that civilians <a href="http://www.uniraq.org/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=6041:un-casualty-figures-for-iraq-for-the-month-of-august-2016&Itemid=633&lang=en">bear the biggest brunt of terrorism</a> [UN report, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54813#.V8mGyGWAHlI">press release</a>] and violence in Iraq, reporting that civilians "accounted for more than two-thirds of those killed or injured in the month of August." Out of 691 individuals killed in Iraq, 473 were civilians. Baghdad had reports that 231 civilians were killed and 676 were injured. Civilians have also been specifically targeted as days ago Daesh suicide bombers attacked a wedding celebration and the capital. The report concluded saying that accurate numbers of civilian casualties could not be obtained for some areas.</p>

<p>Iraq has been closely scrutinized for human rights violations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Former Brazilian president <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/br-profile-leader-idUSN2427652420130312">Dilma Rousseff</a> [Reuters profile] has appealed to the <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verConteudo.php?sigla=portalStfSobreCorte_en_us&idConteudo=120283">Federal Supreme Court</a> [official website] following her removal from office. Arguing that her right to due process had been violated, Rousseff <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1175MC">appealed</a> [Reuters report] to the Supreme Court to issue an injunction on the impeachment. Rousseff, by way of counsel, Jose Eduardo Cardozo, also asked the court to amend the budgetary law from the 1950s that laid the ground for Rousseff's impeachment.</p>

<p>Rousseff was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-president-impeached-in-senate-vote.php">removed from office</a> [JURIST report] on Wednesday following a 61-81 Senate vote in favor of impeachment. Shortly after the decision, Rousseff took to Twitter, proclaiming her innocence and describing the impeachment as a "coup," saying that it was racist, misogynist and homophobic. While awaiting the ruling during her suspension, Rousseff made an <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/suspended-Brazil-president-makes-final-appeal-to-lawmakers-before-impeachment-vote.php">impassioned speech</a> [JURIST report] on Tuesday, in which she claimed she was innocent of the accusations against her and that the evidence against her is only a pretext to overthrow a legitimate government. Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigation and trials. Earlier this month the Senate of Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/brazil-senate-votes-to-open-impeachment-trial-against-president.php">officially indicted</a> [JURIST report] Rousseff, marking the beginning of an impeachment trial against the embattled president. Rousseff's opposition claimed that she doctored documents to hide the size of the national deficit in order to spend more government funds as her re-election neared. It is also believed she continued to forge documents in her second term and spent over USD $210 million without the legislature's approval.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>France court strikes down Nice burkini ban</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in Nice, France, on Thursday struck down the ban on full-body "burkini" swimsuits in the city of Nice after the city authorities continued with the ban, defying last week's <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/france-court-overturns-burkini-swimsuit-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] by France's highest administrative court. The top court of France had struck down the ban on burkinis that was in effect in 30 towns in the south-eastern region of France. However, many of the towns, including Nice, ignored the ruling. The chief lawyer for the city of Nice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">argued on Wednesday</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that burkinis posed a risk of public disorder, even going as far as stating that the city was "almost on the brink of civil war." But the Nice court rejected this claim stating that burkinis posed no risk to "hygiene, decency or safety when swimming. ... In the absence of such risks, the emotions and the concerns resulting from terrorist attacks, and especially from the attack on July 14, are insufficient grounds to legally justify the contested ban."</p>

<p>Tensions in France have been high since an event in Nice in July in which more than <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">84 citizens were killed</a> [BBC report] by a truck that drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day.  Nice was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">one of the first cities</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to ban the burkini, with city authorities claiming that wearing the garment was a risk to public order. Tensions were further increased last week when photographs from a Nice beach showing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">police surrounding a woman in a headscarf</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and a long-sleeved top surfaced last week. Nice authorities denied the woman had been forced to remove clothing. At least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">30 fines</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] have been issued in Nice since the burkini ban was introduced during the summer. Last week France's highest administrative court, the <a href="http://conseil-etat.fr">Council of State</a> [official website, in French], <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/france-court-overturns-burkini-swimsuit-ban.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the ban on burkinis in the French city of Cannes. The court held that imposing a burkini ban is an affront to "fundamental freedoms," including "freedom to come and go," and "freedom of conscience and personal liberty." Former French president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11576712">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [BBC profile] stated to the press that he would amend the constitution to ban full-body "burkini" swimsuits if re-elected next April. His <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/france-ex-president-if-re-elected-burkinis-will-be-unconstitutional.php">comments</a> [JURIST report] came after a statement was made by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who said a ban on burkinis would be <a href="http://www.la-croix.com/France/Politique/Faire-emerger-un-islam-de-France-ancre-dans-les-valeurs-de-la-Republique-2016-08-28-1200785101">unconstitutional</a> [La Croix report, in French]. In response, Sarkozy said: "Well, then we change the constitution. We've changed it thirty odd times, it's not a problem."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>France's anti-terror prosecutor, Francois Molins, <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2016/09/02/francois-molins-l-affaiblissement-de-l-ei-renforce-le-risque-d-attentat_4991439_1653578.html">announced</a> [<em>Le Monde</em> report, in French] his decision Friday to hand down harsher criminal charges, with sentences up to 30 years, for returning French jihadists from Iraq, Syria, and other areas where the Islamic State (IS) is actively involved. Previously, the maximum sentence that could be handed down in such cases was 10 years. According to Molins, the collapse of IS in Iraq and Syria makes the West, including France, vulnerable to increased attacks at home as French jihadists would be forced to return home with IS forces under pressure. Molins stated: "We see clearly in the history of terrorism that when terrorist organisations are in difficulty on their own turf they look for an opportunity to attack abroad." Moilns further stated that 700 French citizens are fighting for terror groups in Iraq and Syria and "at one moment or another we will face the return of a large number of French fighters and their families." A large number of those involved in deadly attacks in France last year were French-born. According to Molins, his office is following up on 324 terrorism cases currently compared to 26 cases in 2013. </p>

<p>Tensions in France have been high since an event in Nice in July in which more than <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">84 citizens were killed</a> [BBC report] by a truck that drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. The Islamic State (IS) has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-16/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-nice-attack/7635270">claimed responsibility</a> [ABC News report] for the attack, which followed a call by IS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani for IS followers to kill non-believers in the West through any means possible. Four men believed to be connected to the attacked were <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/arrested-in-connection-with-nice-attack.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] by authorities later in July. The Bastille Day attack is the second most deadly in a string of terrorist acts in France, including the November 13 <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30717580">Charlie Hebdo attacks</a> [BBC news archive], which claimed 130 lives, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36524094">murder</a> [BBC report] of two French police officials by a man claiming allegiance to IS.  Some cities in France have responded to these attacks by <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=burkinis&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">imposing bans on full-body "burkini"</a> [JURIST archive] swimsuits, with the Chief lawyer for the City of Nice in France even going as far as stating that the city was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">&#8220;almost on the brink of civil war&#8221;</a> [The Guardian report] because of the risk to public order posed by the burkinis. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://ohiodems.org/">Ohio Democratic Party</a> [advocacy website] filed an <a href="https://ohiodems.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1-2016-09-01-Emergency-Application-to-Stay-Judgment-of-the-6th-Circuit.pdf">emergency appeal</a> [text, PDF] with the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] Thursday to stay a federal court <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/16a0204p-06.pdf">ruling</a> [text, PDF] that eliminated the state's early voting period, known as the "Golden Week," which would allow voters to register and vote on the same day. Golden Week is the first five days of a 35-day early-in-person (EIP) voting system, prior to the end of registration before an election. The Democrats allege that the elimination of Golden Week would have a disproportionate impact within minority communities and particularly in the African American population of the state. In its brief, the party claims that African American voters had higher usage rates and placed more reliance on the EIP voting system than other populations. The brief states that it is too close to the election to remove this EIP practice and its elimination would cause confusion and irreparable harm to the public. </p>

<p>Earlier this month the <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] upheld cuts to early voting in Ohio as well as the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ohio-early-voting-cuts.php">elimination Golden Week</a> [JURIST report]. Ohio previously allowed 35 days of early in-person voting but cut that to 29 days and eliminated the Golden Week provision. The state's EIP voting system was a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/09/another-day-another-election-law-battle-at-the-court/">response to the 2004 election</a> [SCOTUSblog report], in which some parts of the state experienced polling-line waits of up to twelve hours on the day of elections. A federal judge ruled in May that the reduction in the EIP voting practice <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, but the Sixth Circuit reversed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20442&LangID=E">press release</a> [test] Friday a UN rights expert expressed on-going concerns for the safety of persons with albinism in Mozambique, while at the same time recognizing that the nation had taken successful steps to improve conditions. Specifically, the UN commended the Mozambique government in its work toward preempting and prosecuting crimes committed against persons with albinism. However, an Independent Expert for the UN, Ikponwosa Ero, warned of the precarious situation still experienced by those with albinism in the region. Around the world, Albinism is subject to mystification and people living with the condition are  harassed, attacked, or killed for their body parts. The expert urged Mozambique to identify the masterminds behind such crimes. </p>

<p>The treatment of albinos in Africa and neighboring countries has been a highly contested human rights issue for many years. Earlier this year Ero noted the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-expert-people-with-albinism-facing-attacks-over-witchcraft-beliefs.php">increasing violence</a> [JURIST report] against people with albinism triggered by fallacious "witchcraft" beliefs. Last year the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/un-rights-office-launches-website-dedicated-to-debunking-myths-of-albinism.php">launched a website</a> [JURIST report] aimed at disproving the myths of albinism. In 2014 the OHCHR said that the Tanzanian government's system of placing children with albinism in government care centers does not provide this vulnerable group with <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/more-protection-needed-for-tanzania-albinos-un-rights-office.php">adequate protection</a> [JURIST report] from those who target albinos. In May 2014 then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay called for <a href="/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=14601&LangID=E">increased protection </a>[press release] for people with albinism after the murder of a 40-year old woman with albinism, adding that the killing demonstrated that the human rights situation for people with albinism in Tanzania and other countries remains dire.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] German automaker <a href="http://www.vw.com/?&cid=ssem_Ps29XwSi_120404328786_c">Volkswagen</a> (VW) [corporate website] on Thursday appealed the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) [official website] decision to support union representation for workers at the VW plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The <a href="https://uaw.org/">United Automobile Workers</a> (UAW) [union website] in December <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-uaw-tennessee-idUSKCN117608">won the right</a> [Reuters report] to represent 160 of the plant's 1,500 workers and planned to negotiate wages and benefits with VW. The automaker argued that it could not support the UAW's efforts because all of its workers should vote on union representation as a group. The matter was subsequently brought to the NLRB, and VW had stated outright its intention to appeal an unfavorable decision. German metalworkers union <a href="https://www.igmetall.de/">IG Metall</a> [corporate website], a supporter of the UAW, has called on VW to respect labor laws and cooperate with the UAW immediately. </p>

<p>VW is facing legal difficulty around the world over allegations that the automaker misled customers in relation to the significantly higher nitrogen oxide emissions being produced by its vehicles. On Thursday the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/australia-suing-volkswagen-for-misleading-customers.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] VW for misleading customers to believe that the vehicles were environment friendly and complied with Australian and European standards and regulations. In August a district court in Germany <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/germany-court-lawsuits-against-volkswagen-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a collective complaint against VW may move forward. Like US-style class-action lawsuits, the collective complaint was launched on behalf of multiple investors who lost money following the diesel emissions cheating scandal. In July a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-volkswagen-settlement.php">gave preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to a $15 billion settlement between VW and the US Environmental Protection Agency, California officials and consumers. In June VW <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/volkswagen-settles-over-allegations-of-cheating-emissions-tests-and-deceiving-customers.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to spend up to $14.7 billion to settle allegations of cheating emissions tests and deceiving customers in a settlement with US regulators. In March the Federal Trade Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ftc-sues-volkswagon-for-false-advertising.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against VW for false advertising.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Malaysian government minister Abdul Rahman Dahlan confirmed on Friday that <a href="https://www.pmo.gov.my/">Prime Minister Najib Razak</a> [official website] is the unnamed official involved in the nation's recent national wealth fund scandal. In 2009 Razak <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-37234717">established the fund</a> [BBC report] known as 1MDB to promote economic growth in Malaysia, but the fund has since been considered a failure due to the country's extraordinary debt. Complaints recently arose accusing high level officials of conspiring to misappropriate USD $3.5 billion from 1MDB. The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-seeks-recover-more-1-billion-obtained-corruption-involving-malaysian-sovereign">filed a lawsuit</a> [press release] in July to seize assets involved in the scandal and specifically named a "Malaysian Official 1" who allegedly received USD $681 million of the stolen money before returning most of it. While it was universally understood that Razak was "Malaysian Official 1," Malaysian citizens subsequently rose in protest demanding that Razak identify himself officially. Dahlan stated that Razak has always clearly been the unnamed party. Furthermore, Dahlan stressed that Razak was unnamed in the lawsuit because he is not involved in the investigation. The Malaysian Attorney General's Office had already <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/malaysia-prosecutor-clears-pm-of-corruption-charges.php">cleared</a> [JURIST report] Razak of corruption charges over the USD $681 million upon finding that the money was actually a personal donation from the Saudi royal family. Protests against Razak will likely take a toll on his international reputation and his upcoming run for reelection. </p>

<p>Razak's corruption allegations have caused controversy over the past several months. In March former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/former-malaysia-premier-files-corruption-suit-against-pm.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against Razak alleging corruption and abuse of power. In July two major opposition parties in Malaysia <a href="/paperchase/2008/06/malaysia-police-investigating-new.php">called for an emergency</a> [JURIST report] sitting of parliament in order to discuss the future of the country's prime minister. A police report has also been lodged against Razak by many opposition members, including <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-1mdb-najib-idUSKCN0PF0F820150705">representatives</a> [Reuters report] of political parties. In 2006 Razak, who has served as the country's prime minister since 2009, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6582475.stm">was accused</a> [BBC report] of being connected to the murder of Mongolian model Altantuya Shaariibuu, after her remains were found in October of that year in Kuala Lumpur. Razak, who was deputy prime minister at the time, denied having any connections to the murder or even knowing the model.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The world's first comprehensive climate pact, the Paris Agreement will only come into force after it is ratified by at least 55 nations comprising more than half of the world's carbon emissions. The US and China signings are a big step forward for the Paris Agreement, as the two nations are responsible for roughly 40% of the world's total carbon emissions. Leaving to the particular signatories how, the agreement seeks to keep global warming below two degrees Celsius. </p>

<p>The Paris Agreement was reached during the twenty-first annual conference of parties, known as <a href="http://www.cop21paris.org/">COP21</a> [official website] and achieved the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius, aiming for only a 1.5 degree temperature rise. According to many experts, <a href="/feature/featured/international-response-to-climate-change/">climate change</a> [JURIST backgrounder] as a result of global greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most pressing and controversial environmental issues facing the international community today. In July US President Obama and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/06/30/us-brazil-joint-statement-climate-change">announced an agreement</a> [text] to <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/us-brazil-china-set-climate-change-reduction-goals.php">address climate change</a> [JURIST report]. Both countries pledged to reduce carbon emissions by increasing the use of wind and solar power sources to 20 percent of each nation's electricity production by 2030.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] <a href="http://www.gov.ie/">Ireland's cabinet</a> [official website] on Friday agreed to join <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> [corporate website] in appealing the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a>'s [official website] <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2923_en.htm">€13 billion ruling</a> [press release] against the tech giant. The commission's ruling, issued in late August, determined that Ireland granted Apple undue tax benefits that now must be recouped. By appealing, Ireland is refusing to accept the windfall from Apple, citing an interest in protecting a tax structure very attractive to international employers. </p>

<p>The European Commission, a subdivision of the EU, <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/european-commission-orders-apple-to-pay-billions-to-ireland.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] the tax breaks were illegal based on EU law because the tax benefit meant that Apple paid less taxes to operate in the country than other businesses, resulting in an unfair economic advantage. The ruling is the result of an <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=3_SA_38373">investigation going back to June 2014</a> [case summary]. The ruling is another setback for the communications company, which continues to face multiple legal issues. The Beijing Municipal High People's Court ruled in May that Xintong Tiandi, a local leather goods retailer, can continue to use the phrase "iPhone" on its leather goods in a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/apple-loses-iphone-trademark-case-in-china.php">trademark case</a> [JURIST report]. The Beijing Intellectual Property Bureau ordered Apple to stop sale of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in Beijing due to claims by Chinese regulators that Apple Inc. <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/apple-ordered-to-stop-sale-of-iphone6-and-iphone-6-plus-in-beijing.php">violated a patent</a> [JURIST report] held by a Chinese company in June. Apple agreed in July to a $25 million settlement with Network-1 Technologies to end a <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/apple-agrees-to-pay-25-million-settlement-in-patent-infringement-case.php">patent infringement claim</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethiopia's opposition leader and leader of the Oromo ethnic group, Tiruneh Gamta, demanded on Saturday the release of all political prisoners "regardless of any political stand or religion or creed." The Oromo ethnic group, representing the largest group among the protestors, is largely credited with starting the protests last November when the government announced its plan to expand the capital into the Oromia region. Although the Oromos initially started protesting against what they viewed as a plan to remove them from fertile land in the region, the protests started taking on a different theme even as the government dropped its plan to expand the capital---one calling for the <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/ethiopia-protests-opposition-prisoners-freed-160903085945178.html">release of political prisoners</a> [Al Jazeera report]. According to rights groups, at least 500 people have been killed and thousands arrested since the unrest began. No one has heard from many of the individuals who have been detained. Many reports have also surfaced of attacks by protestors on foreign-owned business such as flower farms and horticultural companies. Esmeralda farms reported losses of over US$11 million as crowds of protestors torched many foreign flower farms perceived as having links to the government. The government rejected claims that violence from the security forces was part of any systemic plan, and stated its intention to communicate with the opposition groups to listen to their grievances. The government also promised to hold accountable those officers found guilty of abuse.</p>

<p>Ethiopia has used its broad anti-terrorism laws to detain political opposition before. In January several Ethiopian rights groups called on the international community to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ethiopia-rights-groups-urge-international-community-to-address-protester-deaths.php">address the killing</a> [JURIST report] of protesters. In December HRW reported that activists had witnessed <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/12/18/ethiopia-lethal-force-against-protesters">security forces firing into throngs of protesters</a> [HRW report]. That report came a day after Ethiopian <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13349400">Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn</a> [BBC profile] <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/addis-ababa-master-plan-protests-hailemariam-desalegn-warns-merciless-action-will-be-used-1533790">warned</a> [IBT report] of "merciless legitimate action against any force bent on destabilising the area." Ethiopian officials have been claiming that the demonstrations are a front for those involved in the protests to insight violence and threaten the stability of the nation. In October five of nine Ethiopian bloggers who landed in jail in connection with publications critical of the government were <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/ethiopian-zone-9-bloggers-acquitted.php">acquitted of terrorism charges</a> [JURIST report]. That same month UN Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx">Ben Emmerson</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-warns-of-counter-terrorism-measures-used-to-public-interest-groups.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the rising use of counter-terrorism measures around the world. Emmerson stated that many nations have used counter-terrorism as an excuse to restrict public assembly and stop the activities of public interest groups.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Puducherry (former Pondicherry) Legislative Assembly <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/puducherry-assembly-ratifies-gst-bill-amid-opposition-protest-3009717/">ratified</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report] the <a href="http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Constitution%20122nd/Constitution%20%28122nd%29%20%28A%29%20bill.pdf">Goods and Services Tax (GST) constitutional amendment</a> [text, PDF] <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2016/08/indian-parliament-passes-highly-anticipated-goods-and-services-tax-bill/">passed</a> [<em>Diplomat</em> report] by the <a href="http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/">Parliament of India</a> [official website] earlier this month amid a walkout staged by the primary opposing party and ruling party of Tamil Nadu, the <a href="http://aiadmk.com/en/home/">All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam</a> (AIADMK or ADMK). All members of the <a href="http://allindianrcongress.com/">All India NR Congress</a> (AINRC) [official website] continued their own <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/puducherry-assembly-ratifies-gst-bill-amid-opposition-protest-3009717/">boycott</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report] against the ratification of the amendment, which is seen as the biggest tax reform in the country in decades. Specifically, opposition assembly leader and member of Parliament from the ADMK, Anbalagan Arumugam expressed concerns that the GST will be injurious to the union territory of Puducherry and stated that the government should have given time for consideration of the resolution ratifying the amendment. But Puducherry Chief Minister Narayanasamy Velu assured his constituents and the voters that he has taken steps to protect the interests of Puducherry including winning assurances from India Finance Minister Arun Jaitely toward that end. The chief minister also stated that the Puducherry government will continue to enjoy its power to levy and enforce its own service tax and tax on liquor. According to Assembly Speaker Vaithilingam Venkatasubha, the resolution was passed "unanimously."</p>

<p>Much like in the US, ratification of a constitutional amendment by a minimum number of states, approximately half or 15 in India, is required before the amendment becomes effective. This would be India's 122nd constitutional amendment, making the longest constitution in the world even longer. Puducherry is not a state, but a union territory akin to the US Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico for the US. Thus, ratification by Puducherry itself is of minimal consequence to the overall country, and will not be counted toward the 15-state-ratification requirement. According to <a href="http://www.ey.com/IN/en/Home">Ernst & Young India</a> (EY India) [corporate website], the <a href="http://www.ey.com/IN/en/Services/EY-goods-and-services-tax-gst">benefits of the GST</a> [EY India report] include, among other things, a wider tax base and lower tax rates, elimination of a multiplicity of taxes, streamlining of national and state tax administrations, and automation of compliance procedures. The EY India study further points out that "[t]he GST structure would follow the destination principle. Accordingly, imports would be subject to GST, while exports would be zero-rated. In the case of inter-State transactions within India, the State tax would apply in the State of destination as opposed to that of origin." The GST amendment seeks to empower both the central and the state governments of India to levy tax on goods manufactured and services provided in the country. Currently, the central government <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/gst-bill-parliament-what-is-goods-services-tax-economy-explained-2950335/">cannot</a> [<em>Indian Express</em> report] "impose any tax on goods beyond manufacturing (Excise) or primary import (Customs) stage, while states do not have the power to tax services." India <a href="http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/">Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> [official website], a proponent of the GST, <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/pm-modi-interview-with-cnn-news18-gst-will-simplify-taxes-people-wont-joke-about-the-cess-on-their-restaurant-bills-anymore/365944/">stated</a> [<em>Financial Express</em> report]: "People joke on WhatsApp about the bills they have to pay when they go to restaurants. They highlight the food payment and the cess. With GST, all this will be simplified. Also, the state and centre will trust each other more. The entire federal structure will be strengthened."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bangladesh executed a member of the Jamaat-e-Islami party on Saturday for war crimes committed during Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence. Mir Quasem Ali was <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/bangladesh-warcrimes-idINKCN1190QW">accused</a> [Reuters report] of murder, confinement, torture, and inciting religious hatred. In all, five leaders of the party have been <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37268320">executed</a> [BBC report] for war crimes in the country in recent years. Ali was arrested in 2010 and convicted of eight charges in 2014. He was sentenced to death by the <a href="http://www.ict-bd.org/">International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh</a> (ICTB) [official website] and the sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/bangladesh-upholds-death-sentence-for-1971-war-crimes.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] by the Bangladeshi Supreme Court in March. UN humans rights experts <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-experts-urge-bangladesh-to-quash-death-sentence-imposed-on-opposition-leader.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government of Bangladesh to repeal the death sentence imposed upon Ali for failing to meet international standards on fair trial and due process for the imposition of the death penalty.</p>

<p>The ICTB, established in 2009 under the International Crimes Act, is charged with investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence. During the conflict, more than 3 million people are believed to have died and thousands of women raped, but the Jamaat-e-Islami party insists it did not commit any war crimes. Human rights groups have <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/bangladesh-asks-amnesty-to-retract-criticism-of-countrys-execution-plans-for-war-criminals.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] death sentences imposed by the ICTB, stating that trials of war criminals have, in the past, "failed to meet international standards." Motiur Rahman Nizami was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangledesh-executes-islamist-leader-for-war-crimes.php">executed</a> [JURIST report] in May for war crimes. Also in May, the ICTB <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-sentences-4-to-death.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] four men to death for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh's war of independence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel agreed to permit officials from the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] to visit the country and the occupied territories, according to statements made by an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman on Sunday. However, <a href="http://www.netanyahu.org.il/en/about">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</a> [official profile] has not officially agreed to the visit. Specific details, including the timing of the visit, are still <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/israel-put-trial-war-crimes-160904084237369.html">under discussion</a> [Al Jazeera report] with the Israeli government. The ICC requested the visit after receiving complaints of Israel's 2014 Operation Protective Edge in Gaza. Senior officials have <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.739905">stated</a> [Haaretz report] the purpose of the visit will be for outreach and education, not to look into the Palestinian complaints.</p>

<p>The violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created contentious legal and human rights situations. In July, Amnesty International (AI) <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-palestine-and-israel-officials-need-to-deal-with-war-crimes.php">called upon Palestinian and Israeli officials</a> [JURIST report] in a report to properly address human rights violations committed by their forces. The UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">released closing remarks</a> [JURIST report] to its fifty-seventh session in May, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. An Israeli court in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to the 50-day war in Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories Makarim Wibisono <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory after repeated requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte declared the country in "a state of lawlessness" on Saturday following a suspected terrorist attack in Davao City on Friday. Duterte expressed his belief that the explosion, which killed 14 people and injured at least 71 more, was an act of terrorism and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/asia/philippines-explosion-davao-city/">declared a "state of lawlessness"</a> [CNN report], which would allow police and military personnel to frisk individuals and search cars. At this time, Duterte had refrained from declaring martial law. Those who perpetrated the attacks have yet to be discovered, but the Philippine's National Defense Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana said he believes the attack was carried out by Abu Sayyaf, an Islamist militant group. Duterte said the attacks "could be a reprisal" from extremists in response to Duterte's crackdown on drugs and crime.</p>

<p>Duterte took the presidential office in May after <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-president-duterte-takes-office-filipinos-divided-on-dirty-harry-1467320403">promising</a> [WSJ report] the Filipino population that he will restore their broken society, redistribute the wealth, and aggressively crackdown on corruption and crime. Since Duterte has taken office, about 400 suspected drug dealers have been killed and 600,000 have surrendered to the police. Earlier this month, Duterte <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/08/phillippines-president-names-government-officials-connected-to-illegal-drug-trade.php">named</a> [JURIST report] 150 serving and former state officials connected to the nation's illegal drug trade and ordered them to either surrender to the authorities or risk being hunted down. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members of the international community have called upon Cuban dissident Guillermo Fariñas to end his hunger strike. Several people have <a href="http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2016/09/02/in-fragile-health-cuban-dissident-rejects-appeals-from-us-officials-exile/">pleaded with Fariñas</a> [FOX Latino report] to end his hunger strike, a protest begun following government officers brutalizing him earlier in July, saying that he can do more alive than dead for promoting democratic reforms in Cuba. According to Jose Hernandez, the co-founder and president of the Cuban American National Foundation, Fariñas refuses to end his hunger strike. The Cuban dissident has expressed his willingness to die in order to push the Castro regime to enact democratic reforms, though Hernandez has expressed his belief to Fariñas that the current regime will not react to his death. Fariñas has been very open about his displeasure with the United States and the Obama administration for re-opening Cuba-United States relations, which he claims has only further strengthened political suppression by the current government.</p>

<p>Cuba has had a history of <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2011/cuba">suppressing political dissent</a> [HRW backgrounder] through the holding of prisoners of conscience or criminal prosecutions. In 2014, AI called for Cuba <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/08/rights-group-urges-cuba-to-release-prisoners-of-conscience.php">to release five prisoners</a> [JURIST report] whom the group called "prisoners of conscience." In January 2013, various dissident groups, such as the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, said that the Cuban government <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/01/cuba-rights-abuses-against-political-opposition-increasing-report.php">imprisoned more than 6,000 political activists</a> [JURIST report] in 2012. Last August AI called on Cuba <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2012/08/rights-group-cuba-must-stop-harassing-political-activists.php">to end its harassment</a> [JURIST report] of political opposition. That previous July both AI and the US government <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2012/07/us-amnesty-international-criticize-cuba-for-treatment-of-dissidents.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] Cuba for how it treated political opposition. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Sudan <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54846#.V82Efq21iQM">consented</a> [UN News Centre report] to the addition of another 4,000 UN peacekeeping troops to the existing force of 14,000 soldiers, under intense pressure from the UN, US and the rest of the international community. The announcement was made in a joint statement issued Sunday at the end of a meeting between South Sudan <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Salva-Kiir-Mayardit">President Salva Kiir Mayardit</a> [Britannica profile] and the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> (UNSC) [official website] delegation led by the Missions of Senegal and the United States. South Sudan Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomoro stated that a plan containing specifics of the deployment is expected by the end of September, and that the plan would include a "review of procedures related to movement of [<a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unmiss/">UN Mission in the Republic of South Sudan</a> (UNMISS)] [official website] and streamlining the bureaucratic processes." However, US ambassador and co-leader of the UNSC delegation, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/author/samantha-power">Samantha Power</a> [official profile], expressed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/africa/south-sudan-un-peacekeepers.html?_r=0">concerns</a> [NYT report] over criminality in the country as well as existing ethnic, tribal, and political conflicts. Many analysts are also skeptical about any positive difference the additional peacekeeping forces could make pointing out that the troops did not intervene in the ethnic clashes that erupted in late 2011 and 2012 claiming hundreds of victims, including many children, right in their presence.</p>

<p>Human rights concerns have been widespread concerning South Sudan. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] said that South Sudan government (SPLA) security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-south-sudan-government-forces-committing-widespread-violations.php">killed and raped citizens</a> [JURIST report] and looted and destroyed public and private property. In July <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/IDPersonsIndex.aspx">Chaloka Beyani</a> [official profile], UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20256&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press release] recent <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-expert-calls-for-end-of-hostilities-in-south-sudan.php">attacks on IDPs and civilians</a> [JURIST report] in South Sudan. In June <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">expressed shock</a> [JURIST report] at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries, including South Sudan. In May <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-south-sudan-detainees-held-in-inhumane-conditions.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that dozens of detainees in South Sudan are being held in inhumane conditions. In April six human rights organizations <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/rights-groups-next-un-chief-must-stand-up-for-human-rights.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the next UN Secretary-General to do everything he or she can do to protect innocent civilians whose nation faced armed conflict, including South Sudan. In March the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-rights-council-establishes-three-person-investigative-commission-in-south-sudan.php">decided to investigate</a> [JURIST report] allegations of human rights abuses in South Sudan. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia <a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/">Attorney General Mark Herring</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/322875269/Mark-Herring-s-letter-to-U-S-Attorney-General#from_embed">sent a letter</a> [text] to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">US Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] requesting and investigation into the <a href="http://hrrj.org/">Hampton Roads Regional Jail</a> [official website] in Portsmouth after the deaths of two inmates---60-year-old Henry Stewart and 24-year-old mentally ill Jamycheal Mitchell. Stewart had <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/virginia-attorney-general-seeks-us-probe-regional-jail-41848180">filled out</a> [AP report] an emergency grievance form at the jail on August 4, saying he had two blackouts in less than 24 hours and was unable to hold down food or water, before succumbing to death two days later. According to the grievance form, a nurse determined Stewart's concerns "not to be an emergency." According to the medical examiner, Mitchell died of heart failure accompanied by severe weight loss. Mitchell, who was jailed in April 2015, was ordered to be sent to a mental facility, but he was never sent there because his paperwork was stashed away in a hospital staff's desk drawer. According to a lawsuit filed by Mitchell's family, other inmate-witnesses reported that correctional officers physically abused Mitchell and withheld food from him. Herring is urging the DOJ Civil Rights Division to investigate whether systemic constitutional violations are being committed at the jail, either before or after conviction, under the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/eighth_amendment">Eighth</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">Fourteenth</a> [LII backgrounder] Amendments. He stated he is requesting the independent investigation because previous investigations have provided an "incomplete picture" and hopes the DOJ can shed light on steps that the jail should take to bring about any needed systemic change.</p>

<p>The rights of incarcerated individuals are an important and contentious topic worldwide. In the US, the issue is most acutely expressed in the Guantanamo Bay controversy. Late last month Vice President Joe Biden <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/vice-president-biden-expects-guantanamo-to-close-before-president-leaves-office.php">renewed hopes and expectations</a> [JURIST report] that the Guantanamo Bay prison will be closed before President Barack Obama leaves office. A week earlier, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/us-transfers-15-guantanamo-detainees-to-uae.php">announced the transfer</a> [JURIST report] of 15 Guantanamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) amid protests from US Senator Kelly Ayotte who stated that closing the facility would <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pentagon-report-discourages-guantanamo-closure.php">not be in the best interests</a> [JURIST report] of the country and would pose a safety risk. In June, a report indicated that China <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/china-continues-to-harvest-organs-of-prisoners-report.php">harvests</a> [JURIST report] thousands of organs from non-consenting prisoners yearly. In May, over <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/zimbabwe-more-than-2000-prisoners-released-over-congestion-food-shortage.php">2000 prisoners were released</a> [JURIST report] from Zimbabwe's prison system due to overcrowding and food shortages. Also in May, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-south-sudan-detainees-held-in-inhumane-conditions.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that dozens of detainees in South Sudan were being held in inhumane conditions. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Monday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20452&LangID=E">unleashed</a> [official speech] a scathing criticism of Western "demagogues," accusing them of spreading populist xenophobia and racism. At issue for Zeid was the recent <a href="http://www.geertwilders.nl/index.php/94-english/2007-preliminary-election-program-pvv-2017-2021">eleven point manifesto</a> [text] released by Dutch politician <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11443211">Geert Wilders</a> [BBC profile], which laid out plans to remove Islam from the country including the removal of the Koran as well as the closing of mosques. Zeid believes these populist ideals are tinged with bigotry and have spread around the Western political globe, including the US elections. He cautioned that this same rhetoric is seen in Islamic State (IS) propaganda and will have a disastrous effect on the democratic society if people do not speak out against it.<blockquote>Make no mistake, I certainly do not equate the actions of nationalist demagogues with those of Da'esh, which are monstrous, sickening; Da'esh must be brought to justice. But in its mode of communication, its use of half-truths and oversimplification, the propaganda of Da'esh uses tactics similar to those of the populists. And both sides of this equation benefit from each other&#8212;indeed would not expand in influence without each others' actions. The humiliating racial and religious prejudice fanned by the likes of Mr. Wilders has become in some countries municipal or even national policy. We hear of accelerating discrimination in workplaces. Children are being shamed and shunned for their ethnic and religious origins&#8212;whatever their passports, they are told they are not "really" European, not "really" French, or British, or Hungarian. Entire communities are being smeared with suspicion of collusion with terrorists.History has perhaps taught Mr. Wilders and his ilk how effectively xenophobia and bigotry can be weaponized. Communities will barricade themselves into fearful, hostile camps, with populists like them, and the extremists, as the commandants. The atmosphere will become thick with hate; at this point it can descend rapidly into colossal violence. We must pull back from this trajectory.</blockquote>Zeid called for a rejection of these growing ideals. </p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FgipIiN4nQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The speech comes after the UN Chief has called for a host of changes to improve the conditions of human rights around the world. Zeid in August <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-high-commissioner-calls-for-creation-of-independent-international-body.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on the international community to establish an independent international body for conducting comprehensive investigations of human rights violations in Yemen. Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-urges-india-and-pakistan-to-grant-access-to-kashmir.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] his concerns in the same month regarding Indian and Pakistani authorities refusing to allow the Human Rights Council access to Kashmir. Also in August Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-concerned-over-iraq-expediting-death-sentences.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report]  concern over efforts by the Iraqi government to expedite implementation of the death penalty. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mexican <a href="https://www.scjn.gob.mx/Paginas/Inicio.aspx">Supreme Court</a> [official website, in Spanish] on Monday overturned two state anti-corruption laws that would have allowed departing governors to choose prosecutors in charge of investigating corruption allegations against them. Many <a href="http://www.redpolitica.mx/estados/corte-invalida-leyes-anticorrupcion-de-veracruz-y-chihuahua">believed</a> [<em>El Universal</em> report, in Spanish] the laws were passed in an effort to curtail corruption reforms and protect the politicians themselves. The laws, passed in Chihuahua and Veracruz, were ruled unconstitutional in part because corruption is under the jurisdiction of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/about/secretary-general/el-sistema-nacional-anticorrupcion-de-mexico-declaracion-del-secretario-general-de-la-ocde.htm">National Anticorruption System</a> (SNA) [official website, in Spanish]. The <a href="http://www.gob.mx/pgr">Attorney General</a> [official website, in Spanish] filed suit to stop the implementation of the laws and was <a href="http://www.gob.mx/pgr/prensa/toma-pgr-conocimiento-de-los-fallos-emitidos-por-la-scjn-comunicado-1374-16">satisfied</a> [press release, Spanish] with the unanimous decision by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The anti-corruption bills in Mexico follow recent news of courts combating corruption worldwide. Malaysian government minister Abdul Rahman Dahlan <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/malaysia-pm-confirmed-as-involved-official-in-wealth-fund-scandal.php">confirmed</a> [JURIST report] on Friday that Prime Minister Najib Razak is the unnamed official involved in the nation's recent national wealth fund scandal. The primary challenger to incumbent Zambian President Edgar Lungu, Hakainde Hichilema, on Saturday <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/zambia-presidential-candidate-accuses-incumbent-of-electoral-fraud.php">accused</a> [JURIST report] the country's electoral commission of colluding with the Patriotic Front (PF), the ruling party, to manipulate the results of the election. The Mexican Congress in June <a href="paperchase/2016/06/mexico-congress-passes-anti-corruption-bills.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] several anti-corruption bills that would increase the severity of penalties for corruption charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabon's Justice Minister Seraphim Moundounga resigned from his post on Monday amid mass protests concerning last week's disputed presidential election results. Elected president Ali Bongo received 49.8 percent of the vote against 48.23 percent for rival Jean Ping. Ping supporters are claiming that the results were fraudulent and have challenged the election. The opposition questions the results from Bongo's home province, Haut-Ogooue, where the voter turnout was 99.93 percent and Bongo received 95 percent of those votes. Other provinces had a turnout between 45 percent and 71 percent. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201609060709.html">called for a recount</a> [RFI report] on Tuesday and for information concerning 15 French nationals that went missing after the protests. Moundounga resigned in an effort to encourage the government to engage in a recount.</p>

<p>As a result of the election, protests began in Gabon and at least three people have been killed, one hundred injured, and eight hundred arrested in <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/newsletters/archive/newsletter/n4012">mass protests</a> [CFR report]. A report released last week by Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/amnesty-gabon-security-forces-using-excessive-force-against-protesters-after-election.php">condemned Gabon security forces</a> [JURIST report] for using excessive force against protesters after the country's disputed election. Protesters attacked the national assembly building, and in response police used tear gas and arrested hundreds that emerged from the building. Ping claims that his headquarters were bombed by security forces killing at least two people. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Journalist and lawyer Braulio Jatar was charged with money laundering on Monday after he reported on the Caracas protest in Venezuela. Jatar <a href="http://reporteconfidencial.info/noticia/3275948/video-de-rccaracas-rc-60-la-toma-de-caracas-1s/">covered</a> [video footage] the protest on <a href="http://www.reporteconfidencial.info/">Report Confidencial</a> [website]. The protest was <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/newsletters/archive/newsletter/n4011">one of the largest in recent history</a> [CFR report], as thousands gathered to demand a recall referendum on President Nicolás Maduro. Before the September 1 protest, Venezuelan authorities <a href="https://cpj.org/2016/08/international-journalists-denied-entry-to-venezuel.php#more">denied entry to at least six journalists</a> [CPJ press release]. Police <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_VENEZUELA_JOURNALIST_DETAINED?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-09-05-18-08-06">allege</a> [AP report] they found Jatar with a suitcase full of cash and Jatar was jailed following the charge.</p>

<p>The rights of opposition leaders in Venezuela raise significant international conern. In August Venezuelan authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/venezuela-sends-opposition-leader-back-to-jail.php">arrested major opposition leader Daniel Ceballos</a> [JURIST report] stating that the arrest was to prevent his efforts at destabilizing the country. Earlier in August a Venezuelan appeals court in Caracas <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/venezuela-court-upholds-sentence-of-opposition-leader.php">upheld the more than 13-year sentence</a> [JURIST report] of another opposition leader, Leopoldo López. In March Venezuela's National Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/venezuela-legislature-passes-an-amnesty-for-dozen-of-jailed-dissidents.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amnesty law that would free 77 individuals allegedly jailed for political reasons under a number of crimes, including López, but Maduro vowed to veto the law. In November UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-chief-urges-protection-for-venezuela-opposition-after-assassination.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] the protection of political opposition leaders associated with an assassinated Venezuelan opposition leader. In October, a former Caracas prosecutor <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/venezuela-prosecutor-opposition-leader-convicted-on-false-evidence.php">confessed</a> [JURIST report] to being pressured into presenting false evidence to condemn opposition leader López.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A spokesperson from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20454&LangID=E">expressed concern</a> [statement] on Tuesday regarding the intimidation of opposition politicians and peaceful protesters in Cambodia. The comments were spurred by a recent show of force by the armed forces at the headquarters of the <a href="http://www.nationalrescueparty.org/">Cambodia National Rescue Party</a> (CNRP) [party website, in Khmer], the country's main opposition party. The statement also referenced mobilized troops and roadblocks used to block a peaceful CNRP event earlier this week. The spokesperson urged the government to create a pre-electoral atmosphere "conducive to the enjoyment of freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association."</p>

<p>The lack of transparency in the Cambodian legislature and contention between political parties have caused international concern. Last month the prime minister of Cambodia <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/cambodia-pm-sues-opposition-leaders.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] alleging defamation against an opposition leader and opposition party leader. In June the Cambodian parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/cambodian-parliament-opens-investigation-into-opposition-leader.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to allow the Phnom Penh Municipal Court to open an investigation into opposition leader Kem Sohka regarding his alleged involvement with a prostitute. Last November the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, Rhona Smith, <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-rights-expert-warns-cambodias-political-polarization-reaching-breaking-point.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the increasing polarization of the political parties in Cambodia is reaching a breaking point. Also in November Cambodia opposition leader Rainsy was <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/cambodia-opposition-leader-removed-from-national-assembly.php">removed</a> [JURIST report] as a member of the country's National Assembly. That month a Cambodian court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/three-men-charged-in-attack-on-opposition-leaders-in-cambodia.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] three men in the beating of two opposition lawmakers. In October the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-concerned-over-worsening-climate-for-opposition-politicians.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] concern over the "organized attack" on opposition politicians in Cambodia.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A French court in Bastia on the island of Corsica upheld a local ban on full-body "burkini" swimsuits on Tuesday. This decision was handed down despite last month's Council of State <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/france-court-overturns-burkini-swimsuit-ban.php">ruling</a> [JURIST report] in the French city of Cannes. The Bastia court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/06/burkini-ban-corsica-upheld-by-french-court">found</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] the ban to be legal because it had been implemented in response to a disruption of public order. The ban was <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37293201">imposed</a> [BBC report] by the mayor of Sisco after a large fight broke out in August when a woman in a burkini was allegedly spotted at the beach. The court's decision dismissed a challenge to the ban made by France's <a href="http://www.ldh-france.org/">Human Rights League</a> [advocacy website, in French].</p>

<p>Tensions in France have been high since an event in Nice in July in which more than <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36800730">84 citizens were killed</a> [BBC report] by a truck that drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day. Nice was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">one of the first cities</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to ban the burkini, with city authorities claiming that wearing the garment was a risk to public order. Tensions were further increased recently when photographs from a Nice beach showing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">police surrounding a woman in a headscarf</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] and a long-sleeved top surfaced. Nice authorities denied the woman had been forced to remove clothing. At least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/02/burkini-ban-suspended-nice-court-france">30 fines</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] have been issued in Nice since the burkini ban was introduced during the summer. Former French president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11576712">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> [BBC profile] stated to the press that he would amend the constitution to ban full-body "burkini" swimsuits if re-elected next April. His <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/france-ex-president-if-re-elected-burkinis-will-be-unconstitutional.php">comments</a> [JURIST report] came after a statement was made by Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who said a ban on burkinis would be <a href="http://www.la-croix.com/France/Politique/Faire-emerger-un-islam-de-France-ancre-dans-les-valeurs-de-la-Republique-2016-08-28-1200785101">unconstitutional</a> [<em>La Croix</em> report, in French]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] An appeals court in the Algerian city of Setif on Tuesday <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde28/4687/2016/en/">upheld the conviction</a> [AI report] of Slimane Bouhafs, a man the court says slandered Islam and the Prophet Muhammed. Bouhaf's lawyer claims his client only criticized political Islam in a Facebook discussion with non-Algerian Christians. On August 7, the trial court found otherwise, ruling that those Facebook posts were offensive to the prophet, and the appeals court agreed. Now, international human rights groups are <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/get-involved/take-action-now/algeria-immediately-and-unconditionally-release-slimane-bouhafs-ua-19316">calling for</a> [AI press release] Bouhaf's "immediate and unconditional release."</p>

<p>The Algerian government has been taking steps to become more transparent recently, but some critics wonder if these steps are enough. Most drastically, the nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/algeria-adopts-constitutional-reforms.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a package of constitutional reforms in February, which included a two-term limit for the office of the president. In November an Algerian trial court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/algeria-sentences-former-counter-terrorism-chief.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] former counter-terrorism chief Abdelkader Ait-Ouarabi, also known as General Hassan, to five years in prison for allegedly breaching orders and destroying documents. Despite these steps, interest groups have been critical of Algeria, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/07/algeria-3-year-sentence-insulting-islam">for Bouhafs' conviction</a> and also generally <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/algeria">for failure to remedy human rights abuses</a> [HRW reports]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand's <a href="http://www.coj.go.th/en/judicialsystem.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Top-court-sentences-Sondhi-to-20-years-30294691.html">affirmed</a> [The Nation report] the 20-year prison sentence given to Sondhi Limthongkul in 2012. A former media magnate, Sondhi violated <a href="http://www.sec.or.th/EN/Pages/home.aspx">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.sec.or.th/EN/SECInfo/LawsRegulation/Pages/IntroductoryLaw.aspx">regulations</a> [text] when he fraudulently obtained a bank loan, worth approximately USD $400,000, in 1997. Meanwhile, as leader of the ultra-royalist <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13294268">Yellow Shirts movement</a> [BBC backgrounder], Sondhi attempted to have political rival <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13891650">Thaksin Shinawatra</a> [BBC profile], Thailand's Prime Minister from 2001 to 2006, removed from office. Alongside two other members of his managing group, Sondhi was convicted of lying to shareholders and presenting fraudulent documentation about the health of his business. </p>

<p>Although Sondhi's conviction is less contentious, Thailand has been home to significant human rights concerns for years, some of which stem from the nation's court system. In particular, human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand since the military junta came to power in May 2014. Last month, Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/thailand-passes-new-constitution-via-referendum.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a new constitution by referendum vote. The constitution was drafted by a military-appointed counsel and is feared to be another step in entrenching military control of the nation. Thai military officials in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/three-human-rights-defenders-charged-in-thailand-over-report-on-torture.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] three human rights defenders with criminal defamation and violations of the Computer Crimes Act because of a report they published detailing acts of torture in Thailand. In April Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/thailand-urged-to-revoke-military-police-powers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to stop harassing and charging human right lawyers for defending victims of the government's abuses, and to revoke military police powers. In March the Pheu Thai Party <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/thailand-government-accused-of-human-rights-violations.php">filed a complaint</a> [JURIST report] with the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights over the detention of one of its key figures, Watana Muangsook, accusing the government of serious human rights violations. In January UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-thailand-must-fully-investigate-forced-disappearances.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the Thai government to fully investigate the whereabouts of at least 82 people listed as disappeared and criminalize forced disappearance through legislation. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d5977b70676da94b728110e99ff9f29ac7.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4Pa3mSe0?text=&docid=183106&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=574111">ruled</a> [text] Wednesday that the sale of a computer with pre-installed software does not constitute an unfair commercial practice as defined under an EU directive. The suit, brought against <a href="https://www.sony-europe.com/">Sony</a> [corporate website], alleged that the sale of a laptop with a pre-installed Windows Vista operating system distorted the economic behavior of consumers and went against standards for professional diligence. The suit also claimed that the omission of information regarding the individual prices of the included software programs left the consumer uninformed about material elements of his purchase. The court held that the sale of computers with pre-installed programs was not an unfair or misleading practice. Further, the court <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-09/cp160086en.pdf">stated</a> [press release, PDF] that the sale of such technology may actually align with consumer expectations for purchasing ready-to-use computers. The prices of the individual pre-installed programs was not found to be a material element of the transaction. </p>

<p>This suit was initiated in 2011, three years after Vincent Deroo-Blanquart acquired a Sony VAIO laptop. The computer came equipped with, among other programs, Windows Vista. Deroo-Blanquart refused to accept the "end-user license agreement" of the operating system. He then requested a refund for the price of the software from Sony. Sony rejected the request for a partial refund and instead offered to reimburse the consumer for the full price of the computer on the condition he return the laptop, which the consumer denied. The <a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/">Court of Cassation</a> [website] in France was hearing the case on its appeal when it requested assistance from the ECJ. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria</a> [official website] urged parties in the Syrian conflict to return to the "negotiation table" after a new <a  href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">report</a> [materials] released Tuesday highlighted an increase of violence suffered by civilians. The escalation occurred after the deterioration of a cessation of hostilities agreement <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-security-council-unanimously-approves-syria-ceasefire-plan.php">reached by the parties</a> [JURIST report] in February. The report noted that along with summary executions, forced displacement, and indiscriminate shelling and airstrikes, the Syrian people lack sufficient access to life-saving medical services. Commission Chair Paulo Pinheiro <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20456&LangID=E">condemned</a> [press release] the prolific pattern of attacks on medical facilities. He called such attacks a "flagrant disregard of the letter and the spirit of international humanitarian law." More than <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-26116868">250,000 Syrians have died</a> [BBC report] in the conflict and an estimated 600,000 civilians live under siege.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10338256">conflict in Syria</a> [BBC backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war surrounding the legitimacy of President Bashar al-Assad. In August a top UN official submitted a report detailing an in-depth investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-syria-wracked-by-chemical-warfare.php">chemical warfare</a> [JURIST report] used by Islamic State and Assad in Syria. That same month Amnesty International said that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-syria-chlorine-gas-attack-could-be-war-crime.php">amount to a war crime</a> [JURIST report]. In July Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. In June UN human rights experts called for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">immediate protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of children have been driven from their homes due to violence and conflict, according to a <a href="http://www.unicef.org/media/media_92725.html">report</a> [press release] Wednesday by <a href="http://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a> [official website]. The report, <a href="http://www.unicef.org/videoaudio/PDFs/Uprooted(1).pdf">Uprooted: The growing crisis for refugee and migrant children</a> [report, PDF], found that nearly 50 million children have been uprooted from their homes across the globe. UNICEF detailed many of the dangers faced by these children who migrate in hopes of finding a better, safer life, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nearly-50-million-children-uprooted-110000204.html">including</a> [CNW report] malnourishment and dehydration, trafficking, kidnapping, rape and murder. The report found that while children make up a third of the global population, they are over half of the refugee population. Beyond this, the number of unaccompanied children refugees continues to increase. Another concern is the finding that a refugee child is five times more likely to be out of school than a non-refugee child. <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54865#.V9BRn5grKCg">UNICEF called for several actions</a> [UN News Centre report] in order to correct these problems, including protecting children refugee from dangers such as exploitation and violence, ending the detention of children seeking refugee status, keeping families together, providing adequate education and health services to all children refugees, combating xenophobia and discrimination, and stopping conflicts that lead to child refugees.</p>

<p>In March <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/hrw-failure-to-appoint-counsel-to-represent-migrant-children-violates-international-law.php">Human Rights Watch filed a brief</a> [JURIST report] in US federal court arguing that failure to appoint counsel for migrant children violated international law. In November Human Rights Watch reported that more than 400,000 Syrian refugee children living in Turkey are <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/hrw-400000-syria-refugee-children-not-in-school.php">not receiving an education</a> [JURIST report]. Last year UNICEF announced a new plea to raise $14 million in an effort to <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/unicef-announces-new-plea-to-support-refugees.php">support the many children</a> [JURIST report] migrating to Europe from war-torn Middle Eastern nations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zibwabwe's High Court on Wednesday struck down a ban on protests that had been issued by the police. The <a href="http://www.zimlii.org/zw/blog/SI%202016-101A%20-%20Public%20Order%20and%20Security%20%28Temporary%20Prohibition%20of%20Public%20Demonstrations%20in%20the%20Central%20Business%20District%20of%20the%20Harare%20Central%20Police%20District%29%20Order%2C%202016.pdf">two-week ban</a> [order, PDF] was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-zimbabwe-protests-idUSKCN11D1T2?il=0">issued by police</a> [Reuters report] last week after some of the worst public violence in two decades. The court ultimately ruled that the order was invalid as it was given without any authority and violated the constitution. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-police-ban-protests-in-capital-for-next-2-weeks/2016/09/01/54bffe64-7062-11e6-993f-73c693a89820_story.html">police had announced</a> [AP report] last Thursday that they were banning demonstrations within the capital for the next two weeks. This was after numerous protesters were injured during and the day before a planned protest by an opposition group to the government. The notice cited a lack of manpower to prevent public disorder. <a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2016/09/06/Protest-ban-goes-to-Zimbabwe-high-court">Protests had broken out on almost a daily basis</a> [Times LIVE report] due to a poor economy and what many of the opposition view as a corrupt government led by President Robert Mugabe. The police had informed the public that anyone taking part in protests during the ban could face a year of imprisonment.</p>

<p>The Zimbabwe government has faced criticism and legal action in the past. In September 2013 the high court ordered the <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/zimbabwe-court-orders-release-of-21-members-of-opposition-party.php">release</a> [JURIST report] of 21 activist members of the opposition party that had been detained for over two years. The following month, Zimbabwe's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/zimbabwe-high-court-rebukes-insult-laws-prosecution.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] state prosecutors who sought to take legal action against people who insulted Mugabe. In November 2013 a Zimbabwean magistrate <a href="/paperchase/2013/11/zimbabwe-magistrate-acquits-top-human-rights-lawyer.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] a human rights lawyer who was charged with obstructing justice and being unruly to police officers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said Wednesday that Austria will take Hungary to the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/index.php?p1=1">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] if Hungary does not begin accepting returning migrants that crossed into Austria from Hungary. According to EU law, migrants are supposed to remain in the first country they enter, but Austria claims Hungary has been <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/austria-threatens-hungary-court-action-migrants-41917810">breaking this law</a> [AP report] by allowing people to leave their country and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-austria-hungary-idUSKCN11D0JV">enter Austria</a> [Reuters report]. Sobotka made the threat as his country gets closer to the potential annual limit of allowed asylum seekers of 37,500, with around 29,000 people having applied for asylum in the country by the end of July. The law creating the cap on annual asylum seekers was finalized Tuesday and will undergo roughly a month of review before taking effect. The concerns over migrants also come at a time of increased political friction, with a presidential election coming at the beginning of October.</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. Last month the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-bulgaria-arresting-migrants-cause-for-concern.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over Bulgaria's criminalization of migrants leaving and entering the country. In June the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-rules-uk-can-restrict-some-benefits-to-migrants.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Britain's refusal to pay family welfare benefits to unemployed EU migrants who do not have the right to reside in the UK. The judges ruled that such unequal treatment is justified on the basis of protecting a member state's finances. Also in June the ECJ ruled that non-EU immigrants who illegally enter the Schengen area across an internal border <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-of-justice-holds-that-immigrants-that-illegally-cross-schengen-area-cannot-be-imprisoned-so.php">should not be jailed</a> [JURIST report] solely on that basis. In March the ECJ ruled that Germany may place <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-court-rules-germany-can-require-refugees-to-live-in-certain-places.php">"residence conditions"</a> [JURIST report] on refugees. In February the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that new measures put in place by many European countries are too restrictive and <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-europe-placing-undue-hardships-on-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.php">place undue hardships</a> [JURIST report] on refugees and asylum-seekers. Also in February <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [official website] warned Austria that they are violating human rights through their daily cap on <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/amnesty-austria-cap-on-asylum-seekers-violates-human-rights.php">asylum applications</a> [JURIST report]. In January Danish lawmakers approved a controversial bill that will allow Danish authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/denmark-lawmakers-approve-seizure-of-asylum-seekers-assets.php">seize assets</a> [JURIST report] from immigrants seeking asylum in order to cover their expenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <correction num=1><a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/">Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law</a></correction> [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/323263038/NAACP-v-Alabama#from_embed">filed a lawsuit</a> [complaint] Wednesday against the state of Alabama, alleging that the at-large election format for state appellate judges and justices is <a href="http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2016/09/voting_rights_lawsuit_seeks_to.html">racially discriminatory</a> [AL.com report]. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of four African American voters and the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, is seeking the elimination of the format, and provides multiple replacement options, due to the practical effect of watering down the voting power of African Americans. Despite making up over a quarter of the state's population, an African American has never served on the criminal or civil appellate courts, and only three have served as justices on the Supreme Court in the last 36 years. The lawsuit also cites the state's extensive history of discrimination through voting practices, stating that the makeup of the appellate court's is as diverse as when the Voting Rights Act was signed. Although the lawsuit calls for immediate replacement of the election format, a favorable decision for the plaintiffs still would not take effect in time to effect the elections of four new judges this year.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> [official website] earlier this month <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">denied a motion to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's recently overturned law that limited early voting to 10 days and required voters to present approved identification cards, after the <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-portions-of-north-carolina-voting-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] portions of the law upon finding discriminatory intent primarily concerning black state residents. Last month an Oklahoma County judge upheld a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">controversial voter identification law</a> [JURIST report] allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. The <a href="http://naacplegaldefensefund.org/landing/support/education.php?track=ggexpresscj&gclid=CjwKEAiA7f-yBRDAgdv4jZ-78TwSJAA_WdMaBeolxuUY_7t9ajOwAR1CoPC3M3hKqWMSpwFnoMjmzhoCXE_w_wcB">NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund</a> (LDF) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/naacp-files-lawsuit-challenging-alabamas-voter-id-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] in December 2015 asking Alabama to loosen the discriminatory burdens resulting from their voter photo identification law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Columbia</a> [official website] on Tuesday partially granted a tribe's request to suspend the construction of a North Dakota crude oil pipeline running north of the tribe's land. In July the <a href="http://standingrock.org/">Standing Rock Sioux tribe</a> [official website] <a href="http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/3154%201%20Complaint.pdf">challenged</a> [complaint, PDF] the construction in court, arguing that the pipeline would be built on sacred burial grounds and would pose an environmental risk to the surrounding rivers. The tribe's legal challenge has drawn strong support from other tribes and protesters who have set up camp nearby the pipeline's construction site. Though protesters had hoped that the construction project would be shut down completely, Judge James Boasberg only granted a temporary restraining order pending a final ruling to be issued on Friday. Should Boasberg fully grant the tribe's legal challenge, the <a href="http://www.usace.army.mil/">US Army Corps of Engineers</a> [official website] will be required to withdraw their permits for the pipeline immediately. </p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing international legal topic in the past decade. In July a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-allows-alaska-natives-to-place-land-in-federal-trust.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Alaska's challenge in a case determining the right of Alaskan tribes to place land in a federal trust. In May Canada's Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-adopts-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] it would drop its objector status against the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In April JURIST Guest Columnist Dwight Newman of the University of Saskatchewan <a href="/forum/2016/04/Dwight-Newman-indigenous-rights.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] what is happening with recent leave decisions related to Indigenous rights and Canadian energy regulation. In March Canadian indigenous people, including Inuits of Nunavut and the Chippewa, were <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/inuit-appeal-seismic-testing-case-to-canadas-highest-court.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, challenging the use of seismic testing to find natural gas under the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay. In February experts from the UN and the Inter-American human rights systems <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-call-on-canada-to-address-violence-against-indigenous-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Canada to address the "root causes" of the extreme violence and discrimination against indigenous women and girls in that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] President Ali Bongo Ondimba on Wednesday refused to address the EU's recent findings regarding an anomaly in last week's presidential election. Following his loss to Bongo in the poll results, opposing candidate Jean Ping <a href="http://www.heraldonline.com/news/nation-world/world/article100331322.html">questioned</a> [<em>Herald</em> report] the results from Bongo's home province, Haut-Ogooue, where the voter turnout was 99.93 percent and Bongo received 95 percent of those votes. An EU observing commission investigated the matter and found such a voter turnout to be an anomaly, stating that the average voter turnout in other provinces was only 48 percent. The commission's chief therefore called on Bongo to answer the public cries for transparency and publish the polling results for verification. Instead of responding to the commission, Bongo accused Ping of committing fraud and utilizing "cyber-criminals" in a plot to seize power of Gabon. Ping thereafter rejected accusations and pleaded for international assistance to help determine himself as the rightful victor of the election. The US and France have already urged Bongo to release the poll results, and the African Union has offered to help find a resolution. </p>

<p>As a result of the election, protests began in Gabon and at least three people have been killed, 100 injured and 800 <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/newsletters/archive/newsletter/n4012">arrested in mass protests</a> [CFR report]. A report released last week by Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/amnesty-gabon-security-forces-using-excessive-force-against-protesters-after-election.php">condemned Gabon security forces</a> [JURIST report] for using excessive force against protesters after the country's disputed election. Protesters attacked the national assembly building, and in response police used tear gas and arrested hundreds that emerged from the building. Ping claims that his headquarters were bombed by security forces killing at least two people. Amid recent protests and outbreaks of violence, Gabon's Justice Minister Seraphim Moundounga <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/gabon-justice-minister-resigns-amid-presidential-election-protests.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his post on Tuesday. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A former Guantanamo detainee who was resettled in Uruguay was hospitalized and released on Tuesday after his engagement in a hunger strike left him weak. Following his release from the hospital, Abu Wa'el Dhiab <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/hunger-striking-ex-gitmo-detainee-hospitalized-released/2016/09/06/a125ec60-74ad-11e6-9781-49e591781754_story.html">resumed his hunger strike</a> [AP report], vowing that he will continue until he is either reunited with his family or dead. Dhiab is a native of Syria and was one of five detainees accepted by the Uruguayan government after their release from Guantanamo Bay. Dhiab, however, has said that he feels as if he is a prisoner in Uruguay. The Uruguayan government is continuing to figure out a way to reunite Dhiab with his family.</p>

<p>Last month Vice President Joe Biden stated at a press conference in Sweden that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/vice-president-biden-expects-guantanamo-to-close-before-president-leaves-office.php">hoped and expected</a> [JURIST report] that the Guantanamo prison will be closed before President Barack Obama leaves office. Also last month the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/us-transfers-15-guantanamo-detainees-to-uae.php">announced the transfer</a> [JURIST report] of 15 Guantanamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates. The question of shutting Guantanamo down has been one of great controversy. Also last month, a US Senator released a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pentagon-report-discourages-guantanamo-closure.php">Pentagon Report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the profiles of those currently detained in and recently released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) concluded that closing the facility would not be in the US' best interests and would pose a safety risk. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told Fox News in January that US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/white-house-official-obama-plans-to-close-guantanamo-before-leaving-office.php">intends to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] his promise to close the Guantanamo detention facility before leaving office. Last November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed </a>[JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The NDAA comes after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">DOD said</a> [JURIST report] they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the facility in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 presidential executive order to review the status of all detainees. In September White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest said Obama was considering a<a href="/paperchase/2015/09/wh-spokesperson-obama-still-considering-options-to-close-guantanamo.php"> "wide array" of options</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] on Thursday accused Nepal of not doing all it could to prevent child marriages as a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/09/07/our-time-sing-and-play/child-marriage-nepal">report</a> [text] detailed at least 37 percent of girls are still being married before age 18. Nepal is considered to have the third highest child marriage rate in Asia with some girls under the age of 15 being wed even though child marriage has been illegal in the country since 1963. The report, entitled "Our Time to Sing and Play," included interviews with more than 100 individuals impacted by child marriages across the regions with various religious and socioeconomic backgrounds. HRW found that child marriages are not only being arranged by families but also the children themselves who fear rumors of their sexuality or pregnancy will halt their futures. The rights group also found that gender discrimination is still an underlying cause for the practice as women and young girls do not receive the same educational benefits, making a young marriage a viable option to secure a future. HRW believes the government should do more to protect young girls from the practice of child marriage and to ensure their access to education and their futures:<blockquote>The government needs to do much more to prevent child marriage and to help married children. It should make good quality education accessible to all children and enforce the constitutional provision making primary education compulsory. Government schools and health workers should work to prevent child marriage, by intervening in specific cases, raising awareness, and equipping children with the information they need to make informed choices about sex and reproduction. Local government offices should play an active role in raising awareness about the law regarding child marriage and preventing child marriages.</blockquote>The rights of women and girls continues to be an international rights issue. in April the UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in Cambodia, Rhona Smith, <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-expert-urges-cambodia-to-strengthen-protections-for-women-indigenous-people.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the country to strengthen the protection of its women and the rights of its indigenous peoples. In June the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-address-womens-health.php">called</a> [JURIST report] on  the world's governments to take quick, effective steps towards ensuring women are granted equal rights to health, including reproductive and sexual health. In July Gambia and Tanzania's governments <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/gambia-and-tanzania-outlaw-child-marriage-practices.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the end of the practice of child marriage along with prison sentences for those who continue the tradition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2016/09/07/15-16178%20Opinion%209-7-16.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that <a href="https://www.uber.com/?exp=home_signup_form&nav=b">Uber</a> [corporate site] drivers may not join in a class action suit to pursue employment claims against the transportation company but must resolve their disputes individually. The claims included a host of employment contract issues as well as allegations that the company responsible for conducting background investigations of prospective drivers did so without proper authorization and consent. At issue is whether the thousands of California drivers are bound to the arbitration clause in their employment contract. The court ruled that the arbitration agreement was authorized in this case as the plaintiffs not only had notice of the arbitration agreement but also an ability to opt out of the arbitration by sending an e-mail. Furthermore, the court disagreed with the analysis that arbitration would limit the amount the plaintiffs could recover or complaints they could raise as the arbitration encompasses all relevant issues and Uber has agreed to cover all of the cost of arbitration.</p>

<p>The Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-allows-uber-to-appeal-approval-of-class-action.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] in April to hear Uber's appeal of a federal district court order that certified a class of nearly 160,000 drivers in California who were challenging their status as independent contractors. Later that month Uber <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/uber-reaches-settlement-with-drivers-in-labor-dispute.php">reached</a> [JURIST report] a settlement with 385,000 of its drivers in Massachusetts and California in a case surrounding the drivers' status as independent contractors. The California Labor Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/california-labor-commission-rules-uber-drivers-are-employees-not-contractors.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in June of last year that drivers for the personal transportation service Uber are considered employees, not contractors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="https://www.jud.ct.gov/external/super/">Connecticut Superior Court</a> [official website] Wednesday <a href="http://www.jud.ct.gov/CCJEFvRell.pdf">ordered</a> [memorandum, PDF] school officials to overhaul the state's educational funding system, finding that the current system is unconstitutional. In his opinion, Judge Thomas Moukawsher noted that poorer areas grossly under-performed in comparison with wealthier areas. The judge ordered the state to draft and submit proposals within six months, writing that "Connecticut is defaulting on its constitutional duty to provide adequate public school opportunities because it has no rational, substantial and verifiable plan to distribute money for education aid and school construction."</p>

<p>In recent years legislation surrounding education and teachers has generated controversy in the US. Earlier this year an education reform group, Students for Education Reform Minnesota <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/education-reform-group-challenges-minnesota-teacher-tenure-law.php">initiated a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the state claiming state laws governing teacher tenure violates students' fundamental rights to an education. In August 2014 education advocacy groups in New York <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/new-york-advocacy-groups-challenge-teacher-tenure.php">challenged the state's teacher tenure laws</a> [JURIST report], claiming that laws protecting teacher employment violate the civil rights of children to a quality education. In June of that year a judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that the California's system for tenure and seniority for <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/alifornia-court-strikes-down-teacher-tenure-system.php">public school teachers is unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2014, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the state's legislature violated the Kansas constitution when it underfunded K-12 public <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/kansas-high-court-finds-public-school-funding-reductions-unconstitutional.php">education</a> [JURIST report] during the 2009 through 2012 school years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Palestinian <a href="http://www.courts.gov.ps/english.aspx">High Court of Justice</a> [official website] in Ramallah ordered the suspension of local elections in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on Thursday. The <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20160908110748-en5og/">first presidential election to take place in a decade</a> [Reuters report] was scheduled for October 8. The court suspended the election due to the ongoing dispute between rival groups Fatah and Hamas concerning candidate lists, as well as East Jerusalem being unable to participate in the vote as it is annexed by Israel. The presiding judge stated, "[e]lections can't take place in one place and not the other," in his <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/palestinian-court-suspends-local-elections-160908084522573.html">ruling</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Fatah spokesman Osama Al-Qawasmi blamed Hamas for, "foiling the election," while Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri claimed the court decision was politically motivated in favor of Fatah due to the weaker candidate list from that party. The court will hold another session to consider the issue on September 21.</p>

<p>The judicial system in Palestine has given rise to both internal and external criticism. In April Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/palestine-president-establishes-controversial-constitutional-court.php">established a controversial new constitutional court</a> [JURIST report]. Those that opposed the creation point out that Abbas stacked the court in his favor by appointing justices from his own political party widening the split between the Fatah and Hamas political groups. Also in August, Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/human-rights-watch-accuses-palestine-of-free-speech-violations--dnp.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] that detailed five cases in Gaza and the West Bank where journalists and activists were arrested or detained by authorities due to their peaceful criticism of authorities. Activists suggested that court proceedings are used as a means to harass them into silence as they are often delayed and rescheduled due to lack of witnesses, which requires their constant presence at the court. In May a UN spokesperson <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-concerned-about-imminent-gaza-executions.php">urged Gaza to end the use of the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] as the UN feels that Gaza's standard in execution cases is lacking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/CampaignDisclosure/PDF/CampDiscAct.pdf">Illinois Disclosure and Regulation of Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Act</a> [PDF] was ruled constitutional on Wednesday in a <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/">Federal District Court</a> [official website] in Chicago. The law limits how much political action committees (PACs) can contribute to candidates, but permits political parties to contribute as much as they want to campaigns. The law was challenged on First Amendment grounds by PAC supporters who felt the law violated their right to free speech and equal protection. <a href="http://libertyjusticecenter.org/">Liberty Justice Center</a> (LJC) [advocacy website], whose lawyers represented the plaintiffs, <a href="http://libertyjusticecenter.org/cases/illinois-liberty-pac-v-madigan-et-al/#legal-briefs-2">stated</a> [press release] that, "[t]hough enacted under the guise of fighting corruption in Illinois politics, Illinois' campaign finance law actually creates structures that enhance the potential for corruption." Federal Judge Gary Feinerman ruled on the highly controversial issue of legislative caucus committees, and <a href="http://www.sj-r.com/news/20160907/judge-illinois-campaign-finance-law-constitutional">found</a> [SJR report] that the committees are essentially extensions of political parties and, therefore, are not subject to spending restrictions under the law and upheld the constitutionality of the different funding restrictions within the law. LJC said their attorneys would appeal the ruling. </p>

<p>Political corruption through financing activities is a controversial issue in the US. In July the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-dismiss-corruption-charges-against-sen-bob-menendez.php">refused to dismiss</a> [JURIST report] bribery and fraud charges levied against US Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. Menendez is believed to have accepted gifts in exchange for political influence. In June a three-judge panel in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-upholds-conviction-of-former-connecticut-governor.php">rejected the appeal</a> [JURIST report] of former Connecticut governor John Rowland's corruption charges. Rowland had arranged to provide political consulting work in contravention of current campaign finance law, particularly in receiving payments from outside sources. This would not be the first time Rowland served a prison sentence for corruption charges. In 2004 he pleaded guilty to corruption charges and served 10 months of a one-year sentence after he admitted to receiving more than $100,000 in gifts from state contractors.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Irish lawmakers voted Wednesday to appeal the ruling of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] that would entitle the country to almost $15 billion of unpaid taxes from <a href="http://www.apple.com/about/">Apple</a> [corporate website]. Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan T.D. <a href="http://www.finance.gov.ie/news-centre/press-releases/statement-minister-finance-government-decision-appeal-apple-state-aid">released a statement</a> [press release] last Friday explaining that talks between the Fine Gael party and the Independent Alliance determined that allowing the ruling to stand could hurt Ireland's ability to attract foreign investments in the future. Enda Kenny, Prime Minister of the Republic, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/07/cnbc-transcript-interview-with-enda-kenny-prime-minister-of-the-republic-of-ireland.html">gave an interview</a> [transcript] Wednesday detailing how he is confident that the appeal will succeed because tax issues are a matter for each sovereign to decide, not the European Commission. Apple pays from almost 0-1 percent taxes on its profits in Ireland and the European Commission is claiming that the tech giant illegally funded profits through its Ireland headquarters to avoid higher tax payments.</p>

<p>Apple has been party in multiple law suits in the past several years. Just in July Apple agreed to a multi-million dollar settlement agreement with Network-1 Technologies, <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/apple-agrees-to-pay-25-million-settlement-in-patent-infringement-case.php">settling the patent infringement case</a> [JURIST report] that had been pending since 2008. Earlier in March, the US Department of Justice dropped their case against the company after suing them for refusing to unlock the iPhone of the <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/doj-drops-case-against-apple-aftering-unlocking-iphone.php">San Bernardino shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook</a> [JURIST report].       </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California Governor Jerry Brown <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19522">signed into law</a> [press release] two bills that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030. The bills, SB 32, sponsored by Senator Fran Pavle, and AB 197, sponsored by Assembly Member Eduardo Garcia, had been introduced in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The new regulations will assist California to meet or exceed the state's current target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels existing in 1990 by 2020, as established in the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ab_32_bill_20060927_chaptered.pdf">California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006</a> [text, PDF]. Additional requirements for reduction by 2030 will help make it possible for California to reach the ultimate goal of reducing emissions to 80 percent under 1990 levels by 2050. </p>

<p>At least since 1992, with the UN Conference on Environment and Development, <a href="/feature/2014/11/climate-change-international-treaties.php">treaties</a> [JURIST backgrounder] on climate change have bolstered multi-national commitment to combating climate change. On the state level, California has finalized many pieces of legislation seeking to reduce greenhouse gasses and other alleged contributors to climate change for the last decade or more. The state introduced the Clean Car Law in 2002 and the Global Warming Solutions Act in 2006. In the past year, Brown has traveled to the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19390">UN headquarters in New York</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19236">UN Climate Change Conference in Paris</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19048">Vatican in Italy</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19027">Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada</a> [press releases] to urge other leaders to fight against climate change with the same intensity as California. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Prosecutors on Thursday <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-moves-dismiss-mcdonnell-charges">dropped corruption charges</a> [press release] against the former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell. The US Supreme Court had <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/virginia-governors-conviction-vacated-by-supreme-court.php">vacated his conviction</a> [JURIST report] in June. Based on a "careful consideration" of the Supreme Court decision and "the principles of federal prosecution," the US Department of Justice felt it was best to drop the charges.</p>

<p>In 2014 McDonnell and his wife Maureen were accused of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie Williams, the CEO of Star Scientific, in exchange for favors for and promotions of the company. The McDonnells were found guilty of the 11 counts of corruption, and Bob McDonnell was sentenced to two years and Maureen received a sentence of one year and one day. An attorney for Bob McDonnell <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/former-virginia-governor-will-appeal-public-corruption-conviction.php">said he would appeal</a> [JURIST report] his public corruption convictions to the Supreme Court after the Fourth Circuit refused to reconsider the case. The Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-former-virginia-governor.php">granted <em>certiorari</em></a> in January and <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-hears-arguments-in-former-virginia-governors-case.php">heard oral arguments</a> [JURIST reports] in April.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Jean Ping, an opposition leader in Gabon, has filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court in a move challenging the validity of the recent presidential vote. Ping, who was also running for president, lost in the election last week by a very small margin, which brought criticism from many and spurred his request that the votes be <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/gabon-election-jean-ping-challenges-result-court-160908184021440.html">recounted</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Ping has previously expressed doubts about the court's independence.</p>

<p>As a result of the election, protests began in Gabon and at least three people have been killed, <a href="http://www.cfr.org/about/newsletters/archive/newsletter/n4012">100 injured and 800 arrested in mass protests</a> [CFR report]. Earlier this week President Ali Bongo Ondimba refused to address the EU's recent findings regarding an anomaly in last week's presidential election. Following his loss to Bongo in the poll results, <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/gabon-president-ignores-eu-findings-regarding-controversial-poll-results.php">opposing candidate Ping questioned</a> [JURIST report] the results from Bongo's home province, Haut-Ogooue, where the voter turnout was 99.93 percent and Bongo received 95 percent of those votes. A report released last week by Amnesty International condemned <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/amnesty-gabon-security-forces-using-excessive-force-against-protesters-after-election.php">Gabon security forces</a> [JURIST report] for using excessive force against protesters after the country's disputed election. Protesters attacked the national assembly building, and in response police used tear gas and arrested hundreds that emerged from the building. Ping claims that his headquarters were bombed by security forces killing at least two people. Amid recent protests and outbreaks of violence, Gabon's Justice Minister Seraphim Moundounga <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/gabon-justice-minister-resigns-amid-presidential-election-protests.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his post on Tuesday.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Environmentalists <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/ocean_acidification/pdfs/1-OA_WQS_Complaint.pdf">sued</a> [complaint, PDF] the <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) [official website] on Thursday regarding federal water quality standards. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/environment-oceans-idUSL1N1BK26T">environmentalists are seeking</a> [Reuters report] new standards "designed to protect marine life against the corrosive effects of carbon emissions absorbed into the ocean from the burning of fossil fuels." The lawsuit was filed by the <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/">Center for Biological Diversity</a> [advocacy website], which is <a href="http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2016/ocean-acidification-09-08-2016.html">accusing</a> [press release] the EPA of failing to follow the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf">Clean Water Act</a> [text, PDF], which requires them to take action in the face of a rising threat to ocean acidification. The lawsuit is requesting that standards for measuring pollutants be updated to reflect more recent scientific discoveries.  The Center for Biological Diversity claims that recent science, showing carbon dioxide emissions are altering the chemistry of oceans and making seawater more acidic, calls for an update to the water-quality standards which have not been revised in more than 40 years.</p>

<p>Water contamination has been a major concern over the last year. In March Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">served with a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the water contamination in Flint, Michigan. In February <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bp-supervisor-found-not-guilty-of-clean-water-act-violation.php">BP supervisors were found not guilty</a> [JURIST report] of a Clean Water Act violation after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Also in February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-supreme-court-delays-epas-clean-power-plan.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which meant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In December a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/federal-appeals-court-preserves-epa-regulation.php">preserved the EPA's Mercury regulations</a> [JURIST report] that limit mercury and other hazardous pollutants from coal-fired power plants. In October the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/sixth-circuit-court-of-appeals-temporarily-blocks-clean-water-rule-enforcement.php">Sixth Circuit temporarily stayed the EPA's new Clean Water Rule</a> [JURIST report] for the Clean Water Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/about-attorney-general">Attorney General Eric Schneiderman</a> [official profile] <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/abortion_opinion_2016-f1.pdf">took steps</a> [legal opinion, PDF] on Wednesday towards allowing late-term abortions in New York. Schneiderman <a href="http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-issues-legal-opinion-clarifying-new-york-states-criminal-law-does-not">claims</a> [press release] that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] rulings allow late-term abortions in cases where the mother's health is in jeopardy or the fetus suffers a fatal complication. He argues that the 1970 state law, which prohibits abortions past 24 weeks unless the mother's life is in jeopardy, does not fall in line with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12334123945835207673&q=roe+v.+wade&hl=en&as_sdt=3,39">Roe v. Wade</a> [opinion]. The legal opinion written from Schneiderman gives hospital and clinics legal backing to perform such abortions even while the state law remains. Until now, women seeking or requiring such abortions often had to leave the state to receive them. Opponents to the opinion <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/nyregion/new-york-late-term-abortion-schneiderman.html?_r=0">claim</a> [NYT report] that the opinion provides "abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy."</p>

<p>Abortion in general continues to be a highly controversial subject in the US. In July a US district judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-blocks-florida-efforts-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against a law intended to cut state funding to clinics administering abortions. That same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-federal-court-blocks-state-abortion-bill.php">placed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on an Indiana law that would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. Recently the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">Texas law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) [official website], a federal agency entrusted with consumer protection in the financial sector, <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-fines-wells-fargo-100-million-widespread-illegal-practice-secretly-opening-unauthorized-accounts/">announced</a> [press release] on Thursday a $100 million fine against banking giant <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/investor-relations/">Wells Fargo</a> [corporate website] for widespread illegal sales practices. CFPB is authorized by the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/wallstreetreform-cpa.pdf">Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</a> [text, PDF] to take action against those who violate consumer financial laws. Specifically, the CFPB <a href="http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/092016_cfpb_WFBconsentorder.pdf">consent order</a> [order, PDF] requires Wells Fargo to pay full refunds to consumers, pledge their commitment to ensure proper sales practices, comply with various documentation and employee training requirements, and pay a $100 million fine. According to CFPB's <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/hundreds-thousands-accounts-secretly-created-wells-fargo-bank-employees-leads-historic-100-million-fine-cfpb/">official statement</a> [statement, text], Wells Fargo has been cited for a number of violations including but not necessarily limited to: 1) opening deposit accounts and transferring funds without authorization; 2) applying for credit-card accounts without customer consent thereby hiking up fees, interest and other finance charges; 3) issuing and activating debit cards, even going as far as creating PINs, without consent; and 4) creating phony email addresses to enroll consumers in online-banking services. CFPB stated that Wells Fargo had bonus and other incentive programs in place to encourage employees to enroll existing clients for deposit accounts, credit cards, debit cards and other banking products and services and the employees engaged in these unlawful practices in their attempt to win these incentives and achieve their compensation targets. CFPB Director Richard Cordray stated: "Because of the severity of these violations, Wells Fargo is paying the largest penalty the CFPB has ever imposed. Today's action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences."</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the CFPB has taken action against a major bank. In April 2014 the CFPB <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/bank-of-america-ordered-to-pay-727-million-to-consumers.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] another banking giant, Bank of America, to pay $727 million for its illegal credit card practices. Many fraud cases continue to be litigated eight years after the 2008 financial crisis. In March 2015 the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/doj-criticizes-new-white-collar-crime-sentencing-recommondations.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the US Sentencing Commission after a federal panel introduced a proposal which would reduce prison time for white-collar criminals. In July 2014 Citigroup, Inc. <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/citibank-reaches-7-billion-mortgage-securities-inquiry-settlement.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to pay USD $7 billion to settle a federal inquiry into mortgage-backed securities sold by the bank prior to the financial crisis. In April 2014 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/supreme-court-to-rule-in-mortgage-lending-case.php">granted certiorari</a> [JURIST report] to hear a mortgage lending case in which Countrywide failed to provide required information and the borrowers attempted to rescind the loan. In February 2014 JPMorgan Chase <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/jpmorgan-chase-to-pay-614-million-in-mortgage-lending-settlement.php">paid</a> [JURIST report] a USD $614 million settlement to the US government for its role in approving unqualified mortgages for government insurance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/144549p.pdf">restored</a> [opinion, PDF] gun ownership rights of two individuals convicted of minor crimes. One of these individuals was 41-year-old Daniel Binderup, who was convicted of having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old female employee at his bakery. Binderup was aware that the employee was a minor, but the legal age of consent in Pennsylvania at the time was 16. Binderup only served three years probation in addition to being required to pay a $300 fine, court costs and restitution. The other individual was Julio Suarez, previously convicted of being in possession of a firearm without a permit and of a separate DUI charge. Both individuals successfully challenged the state prohibitions against their ownership of firearms in Pennsylvania in 2009, but the federal prohibition continued to this date. The appeals court concluded that Suarez and and Binderup have "rebutted the presumption that they lack Second Amendment rights by distinguishing their crimes of conviction from those that historically led to exclusion from Second Amendment protections" and that "the Government has failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate under even intermediate scrutiny that it may, consistent with the Second Amendment, apply § 922(g)(1) to bar Binderup and Suarez from possessing a firearm in their homes." Counsel for Binderup and Suarez stated that they expect the <a href="http://www.doj.gov">Department of Justice</a> to appeal the ruling.</p>

<p>Gun control and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Earlier this month the New Jersey Second Amendment Society <a href="h/paperchase/2016/08/second-amendment-group-challenging-stun-gun-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the state's Attorney General in New Jersey's district court alleging the state's stun gun ban is unconstitutional. In June the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-upholds-firearm-prohibitions-for-reckless-domestic-violence.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law conviction on reckless domestic assault is sufficient to bar possession of a firearm under federal law. Earlier in June Hawaii Governor David Ige <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/hawaii-governor-signs-bill-to-put-gun-owners-on-fbi-database.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring gun owners to be listed on an FBI database, notifying police if a Hawaii citizen is arrested in another state and providing a continuous criminal record check on those individuals seeking to possess a firearm. Also in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-assault-weapons-bans.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases challenging bans on assault-style weapons. The court denied the appeals without comment, letting stand lower court rulings that had <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld the bans</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional. In response to the mass killing in Orlando in June, the UN's top human rights official <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-chief-calls-for-increased-gun-control-in-us.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its gun control measures. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-authorities-may-require-permits-for-concealed-handguns-in-public.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in June that the right to carry a concealed gun is not within Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A judge for the <a href="http://www.mssd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi</a> [website] on Thursday <a href="https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/mississippi/mssdce/3:2016cv00151/91521/28">dismissed</a> [opinion, PDF] a challenge to the constitutionality of the Mississippi state flag. In his opinion, Judge Carlton Reeves noted that the flag, which prominently features the Confederate battle emblem, was adopted in 1894 and survived a 2001 referendum to redesign it. Carlos Moore, the attorney who brought the case, claimed that the Confederate imagery of the state flag violated the Equal Protection and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The injuries cited by Moore included physical and emotional responses elicited by the emblem. While the judge condemned the Confederate badge, he ruled that, "the injuries alleged by Moore are untethered to any legal right." Reeves wrote that while the judiciary could not remedy the injuries suffered in this case, perhaps "'the people themselves'" could act to change the flag. He concluded by stating that the emblem is "better left retired to history."</p>

<p>Debate has intensified in the past year over the acceptability of confederate symbols in everyday life. In August 2015 a judge in Texas denied a request for a temporary restraining order to halt the University of Texas at Austin from relocating a statue of <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/judge-allows-removal-of-a-university-of-texas-confederate-statue.php">Confederate President Jefferson Davis</a> [JURIST report]. In July it came to light that Dylann Roof, who is charged with the <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/temporary-not-guilty-plea-entered-for-charleston-shooting-suspect.php">murder of nine black church members in South Carolina</a> [JURIST report], prominently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/us/dylann-storm-roof-photos-website-charleston-church-shooting.html?_r=3">posed</a> [NYT report] with the confederate flag. Also in July South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from the <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/south-carolina-removes-confederate-flag-from-statehouse.php">state house</a> [JURIST report]. Although the Charleston shooting led to renewed focus on the use of the Confederate flag, controversy over the flag has persisted for years. In June of last year the US Supreme Court ruled that <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-states-can-restrict-license-plate-messages.php">state governments can restrict</a> [JURIST report] the kinds of messages printed on specialty license plates after the Sons of Confederate Veterans argued that the Texas government's refusal to issue specialty license plates including an image of the confederate flag violated the First Amendment. In 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/08/sixth-circuit-upholds-tennessee-school.php">a federal court affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a district court's grant of summary judgment to a Tennessee public high school in a lawsuit brought by three students who claimed the school's ban on wearing the Confederate flag was unconstitutional.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.house.gov/">US House of Representatives</a> [official website] approved <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-114s2040rfh/pdf/BILLS-114s2040rfh.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] Friday that would allow US nationals to seek relief from foreign governments if that entity is believed to have had involvement with a terrorist attack taking place within the US that caused physical damage to that citizen's person or property. The Act, titled the "Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act," would allow families of those killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. President Barack Obama is in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/us/politics/house-911-victims-saudi-arabia.html">opposition</a> [NYT report] to the bill because of its major foreign policy implications, including the possibility that US approval of the Act would open the country up to receiving civil suits by foreign nationals in return. The Saudi government has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/us/politics/senate-passes-bill-that-would-expose-saudi-arabia-to-legal-jeopardy-over-9-11.html?_r=0">warned</a> [NYT report] that if such legislation is enacted it may begin selling off up to $750 billion in Treasury securities and other assets. The US government <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36811642">maintains</a> [BBC report] that Saudi Arabia did not fund the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>The Act was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/us-senate-approves-bill-allowing-saudi-arabia-to-be-sued-for-911-attacks.php">approved </a>[JURIST report] by the Senate in May. Obama has threatened to veto the bill. In 2012 a US District  judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-dismisses-motion-to-reinstate-saudi-arabia-as-911-defendant.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Saudi Arabia as a defendant in a civil compensation lawsuit by victims against the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim against Saudi Arabia was dismissed in 2008 by a US Appeals Court due to insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes has actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the attacks. In 2005 Judge Richard Casey <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/rulings/03MDL1570_RCC_011905.PDF">dismissed </a>[PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">report</a>] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that all had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Obama administration on Thursday shut down a Guantanamo Bay prison camp to expedite the permanent closing of the detention center. Camp 5 was a 100-cell maximum security prison that was known for <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/08/obama-administration-shuts-down-one-prison-camp-at-guantanamo-bay.html">receiving problematic detainees</a> [Fox News report] such as hunger strikers and war criminals. The prison staff began moving detainees out of Camp 5 last month, and all of its detainees are now being consolidated into the detention center's remaining camps. The staff plans to repurpose Camp 5 into a medical clinic to meet prison needs. As the Obama administration struggles with Congress to close the detention center, only 61 detainees remain in Guantanamo Bay. Officials are hoping to cut down the staff of 2,000 members by 400 by canceling future deployments. </p>

<p>Last month Vice President Joe Biden stated at a press conference in Sweden that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/vice-president-biden-expects-guantanamo-to-close-before-president-leaves-office.php">hoped and expected</a> [JURIST report] that the Guantanamo prison will be closed before President Barack Obama leaves office. Also last month the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/us-transfers-15-guantanamo-detainees-to-uae.php">announced the transfer</a> [JURIST report] of 15 Guantanamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates. Earlier in August a US Senator <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pentagon-report-discourages-guantanamo-closure.php">released a Pentagon Report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the profiles of those currently detained in and recently released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) concluded that closing the facility would not be in the US' best interests and would pose a safety risk. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told Fox News in January that US President Barack Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/white-house-official-obama-plans-to-close-guantanamo-before-leaving-office.php">intends to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] his promise to close the Guantanamo detention facility before leaving office. Last November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The NDAA comes after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">DOD said</a> [JURIST report] they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the facility in October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 presidential executive order to review the status of all detainees. In September White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest said Obama was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/wh-spokesperson-obama-still-considering-options-to-close-guantanamo.php">considering a "wide array" of options"</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/090916zr_j42k.pdf">rejected</a> [order, PDF] Michigan's appeal of an <a href="http://media.mlive.com/news_impact/other/Injunction.pdf">injunction</a> [text, PDF] that would not allow the state to ban straight-ticket voting. The <a href="http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/publicact/pdf/2015-PA-0268.pdf">ban</a> [text, PDF] had been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rejects-michigan-ban-on-straight-ticket-voting/2016/09/09/7ce6bff6-7533-11e6-be4f-3f42f2e5a49e_story.html">passed</a> [WP report] by the legislature in 2015 and was heavily supported by state Republicans calling for the same modern ballot system already adopted by 40 other states. State democrats argued that the Republicans' support of the ban was meant to inhibit minority voters that typically choose the Democratic Party. In July a district judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/michigan-to-appeal-decision-allowing-straight-ticket-voting.php">enjoined</a> [JURIST report] enforcement of the law, stating that the ban on straight-ticket voting, which violates Equal Protection and the <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act</a> [law, PDF], is "caused by or linked to social and historical conditions that have produced or currently produce discrimination against African Americans." The judge's decision relied upon a report which links straight-ticket voting, generally for Democrats, to higher populations of African Americans within a community. Though the Supreme Court denied Michigan's appeal of the decision, the justices did not offer any reasoning for their determination. Two justices stated they would have supported the state yet similarly decided not to voice their opinions. The court's decision suggests that future legal challenges regarding voting controversies will be similarly treated as the presidential election approaches. </p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Last week the Supreme Court denied a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">motion to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's recently overturned law that limited early voting to 10 days and required voters to present approved identification cards. Also last month the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-reconsider-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an emergency petition for a rehearing regarding the Wisconsin voter ID law. The Illinois Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/illinois-supreme-court-blocks-redistricting-proposal-from-ballot.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] last week that placing a redistricting proposal on the ballot this fall would be unconstitutional. Earlier this month an Oklahoma County judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld a controversial voter identification law </a> [JURIST report] allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. Last month voter restrictions were overturned not only in North Carolina, but in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports]. Also last month Michigan Attorney General spokesman John Sellek <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/michigan-to-appeal-decision-allowing-straight-ticket-voting.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette and Secretary of State Ruth Johnson plan to appeal an injunction on the state's law eliminating straight-ticket voting. Also Cook County Circuit Court Judge Diane Larsen <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/cook-county-judge-blocks-illinois-redistricting-ballot-measure.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a ballot measure proposing an amendment to the Illinois Constitution that aimed to eliminate the General Assembly's power to draw legislative district boundaries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Construction on the Dakota Access oil pipeline was paused on Friday by request of three federal agencies that urged pipeline owner <a href="http://www.energytransfer.com/">Energy Transfer Partners</a> [corporate website] to pause its lawful building after a federal judge <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2016cv1534-39">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] in the company's favor. US District Judge James Boasberg denied injunctive relief to the <a href="http://standingrock.org/">Standing Rock Sioux tribe</a> [tribe website], which had sought to prevent the Dakota Access pipeline from being built across sacred land. In his opinion, Boasberg stated, "this Court does not lightly countenance any depredation of lands that hold significance to the Standing Rock Sioux" and that, "the Court scrutinizes the permitting process here with particular care. Having done so, the Court must nonetheless conclude that the Tribe has not demonstrated that an injunction is warranted here." Soon thereafter, the Departments of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Justice</a>, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/">Interior</a> and <a href="https://www.army.mil/">Army</a> [official websites] released a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-department-justice-department-army-and-department-interior-regarding-standing">joint statement</a> [text] in which they pledged to "reconsider any of its previous decisions" on land around Lake Oahe, a sacred Sioux sight, and "highlighted the need for a serious discussion on whether there should be nationwide reform with respect to considering tribes' views on these types of infrastructure projects." Within this statement, the agencies requested that the Dallas-based pipeline owner voluntarily suspend building while they sort out policy issues. </p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing international legal topic in the past decade. In this case, Boasberg <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-judge-halts-construction-of-north-dakota-oil-pipeline-near-tribal-land.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a temporary injunction to halt building earlier this week, with the caveat that it would be superseded by his Friday ruling. In other indigenous matters, a federal appeals court in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-allows-alaska-natives-to-place-land-in-federal-trust.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Alaska's challenge in a case determining the right of Alaskan tribes to place land in a federal trust. In May Canada's Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-adopts-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] it would drop its objector status against the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In April JURIST Guest Columnist Dwight Newman of the University of Saskatchewan <a href="/forum/2016/04/Dwight-Newman-indigenous-rights.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] what is happening with recent leave decisions related to Indigenous rights and Canadian energy regulation. In March Canadian indigenous people, including Inuits of Nunavut and the Chippewa, were <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/inuit-appeal-seismic-testing-case-to-canadas-highest-court.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, challenging the use of seismic testing to find natural gas under the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay. In February experts from the UN and the Inter-American human rights systems <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-call-on-canada-to-address-violence-against-indigenous-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Canada to address the "root causes" of the extreme violence and discrimination against indigenous women and girls in that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Aruba votes to recognize same-sex unions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.parlamento.aw/">Aruban legislature</a> [official website, in Dutch] on Friday voted to give official recognition to same-sex couples, giving them the right to register their unions and receive the benefits granted to other married people. Those benefits, such as the right to make medical decisions on behalf of a spouse or the right to a spouse's pension in case of death, will be entered into the <a href="http://www.gobierno.aw/gobernacion/texto-di-ley-1501-burgerlijk-wetboek_44225/">civil code</a> [text, in Dutch] after the Aruba legislature voted to do so 11-5. Aruba is a <a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/caribbean-parts-of-the-kingdom">constituent of the Netherlands</a> [Netherlands government overview], which recognizes same-sex marriage. This dichotomy previously forced Arubans to travel to the Netherlands to be married then return to Aruba, where the marriage would be recognized. Now, although Aruba did not vote to recognize same-sex marriage, such couples will not have to leave the island to be afforded the benefits of marriage. </p>

<p>The lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender community (LGBT) continues to face legal challenges throughout the world. Last month, the Belize Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/belize-top-court-strikes-down-anti-homosexuality-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law banning sodomy, declaring it unconstitutional and adversely impactful to the LGBT community. Last December voters in Slovenia <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/slovenia-voters-reject-same-sex-marriage-law.php">rejected a law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. In November the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples can legally adopt children. The UN has become increasingly focused on the rights of LGBT individuals. In September 2015 12 UN agencies <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">released a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] arguing that abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole. In June 2015 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-office-reports-continued-lgbt-discrimination.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea Manning, a former US soldier imprisoned for leaking classified documents, has gone on a hunger strike to protest her mistreatment at the <a href="https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/lvn/">Fort Leavenworth</a> [official website] facility in Kansas where she has been imprisoned since her conviction in military court in 2013. Manning was convicted of leaking 700,000 classified government documents to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> [advocacy website] and has been serving a 35-year sentence. Manning stated that she started the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/09/10/chelsea-manning-starts-hunger-strike-protest-treatment/zxUpiJF467OGGo04ONW1dN/story.html">hunger strike</a> [AP report] because all her requests so far for better treatment have been ignored. An <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] attorney representing Manning stated her intention to continue the hunger strike until "minimum standards of dignity, respect and humanity" are complied with. Manning has said she will not voluntarily consume anything except prescription medication and water, and that she is prepared for the possibility of dying.</p>

<p>According to the ACLU, Manning was being <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/chelsea-manning-facing-new-charges-after-suicide-attempt.php">investigated</a> [JURIST report] in July for charges in relation to a suicide attempt at the facility. At the time, ACLU Staff Attorney Chase Strangio issued a statement in which he was deeply critical of the Army's handling of Manning, in particular the "denial of medical care related to her gender transition" despite "the treatment [being] recognized as necessary." The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/chelsea-manning-faces-new-charges-indefinite-solitary-confinement-related-suicide-attempt">report</a> [press release] went on to say that the Army continued to deny necessary medical care to Manning, including medical treatment following her suicide attempt.  <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">Manning's trial</a> [JURIST op-ed] in 2013 and the subsequent litigation that followed has garnered much debate. In May Manning <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/chelsea-manning-appeals-35-year-sentence.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her 35-year prison sentence. In 2013 Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">filed for a presidential pardon</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35-year sentence</a> [JURIST reports]. The sentence came a month after she was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act, but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." The judge had <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] in order to require the government to prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against her for providing classified materials to Wikileaks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf">US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/14C80589DDE01F4F8525802A00009F33/$file/16-5196CHMJ.pdf">blocked</a> [opinion, PDF] a proof of citizenship requirement imposed upon voters by the states of Alabama, Georgia and Kansas. The court found that the parties challenging the requirement "have demonstrated irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, that the balance of equities tips in their favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest." The court ordered the <a href="http://www.eac.gov/">US Election Assistance Commission</a> (the Commission) [official website], and anyone acting on its behalf, to:<blockquote>take all actions necessary to restore the status quo ante, pending a determination on the merits, including promptly removing from the state-specific instructions those requirements directing voter registration applicants to submit proof of their United States citizenship, informing Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia that [National Mail Voter Registration] Form [Federal Form] applications filed since January 29, 2016 should be treated as if they did not contain the now-stricken state-specific instructions, and promptly posting on the Commission's website the modified version of the Federal Form."</blockquote>The case was brought by the <a href="http://lwv.org/">League of Women Voters of the US</a> (LWV) [advocacy website] against Brian Newby, executive director of the US Election Commission. Newby argued the requirement of a birth certificate or passport proving citizenship prevents voter fraud, while a spokesman for the LWV called the requirements an attempt at "thinly veiled discrimination." </p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. On Friday the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-denies-michigans-request-to-ban-straight-ticket-voting.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Michigan's appeal of an <a href="http://media.mlive.com/news_impact/other/Injunction.pdf">injunction</a> [text, PDF] that prevented the state from ban straight-ticket voting. Last week the Supreme Court also denied a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">motion to reinstate</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's recently overturned law that limited early voting to 10 days and required voters to present approved identification cards. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-reconsider-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an emergency petition for a rehearing regarding the Wisconsin voter ID law. Also last month the Illinois Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/illinois-supreme-court-blocks-redistricting-proposal-from-ballot.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that placing a redistricting proposal on the ballot this fall would be unconstitutional. Earlier in August an Oklahoma court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial voter identification law allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. In July voter restrictions were overturned not only in North Carolina, but in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</A> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.vw.com/">Volkswagen</a> (VW) [corporate website] engineer <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/890756/download">pleaded guilty</a> [plea agreement, PDF] in federal court on Friday to one count of conspiracy to defraud the US, commit wire fraud and violate the <a href="http://www.epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf">Clean Air Act</a> [text, PDF] by implementing software in the manufacturer's vehicles that could cheat US emissions tests. James Robert Liang was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/890761/download">indicted</a> [indictment, PDF] in the Eastern District of Michigan in June, but the record was just unsealed Friday. The <a href="http://www.doj.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] stated that Liang and other employees <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/volkswagen-engineer-pleads-guilty-his-role-conspiracy-cheat-us-emissions-tests">designed</a> [press release] the engine in 2006 after they were unable to design an engine that met US emissions standards. According to Liang, his co-conspirators lied to the <a href="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the <a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/homepage.htm">California Air Resources Board</a> (CARB) [official websites] when they were seeking certifications required to sell vehicles in the US and continued to deceive the agencies for model years 2009 through 2016. During this time, Volkswagen advertised its cars to the public as environmentally-friendly and "clean diesel." As part of the plea agreement, Liang has agreed to assist in further investigations. He faces a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and/or three years of supervised release as well the possibility of a $250,000 fine, and restitution.</p>

<p>VW is facing legal difficulty around the world over the emissions scandal. Earlier this month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/australia-suing-volkswagen-for-misleading-customers.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] VW and its local subsidiary for misleading customers. In August a district court in Germany, <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/germany-court-lawsuits-against-volkswagen-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a collective complaint against VW may move forward. Like US-style class-action lawsuits, the collective complaint was launched on behalf of multiple investors who lost money following the diesel emissions cheating scandal. In July a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-volkswagen-settlement.php">gave preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to a $15 billion settlement between VW and the US EPA, California officials and consumers. In June VW <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/volkswagen-settles-over-allegations-of-cheating-emissions-tests-and-deceiving-customers.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to spend up to $14.7 billion to settle allegations of cheating emissions tests and deceiving customers in a settlement with US regulators. In March the Federal Trade Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ftc-sues-volkswagon-for-false-advertising.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against VW for false advertising.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tens of thousands of people marched in Mexico in protest of same-sex marriage Saturday, a controversial topic in the country exacerbated by a proposal from embattled <a href="http://www.gob.mx/presidencia/">President Enrique Peña Nieto</a> [official website, Spanish] to recognize same-sex marriage. The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-gaymarriage-idUSKCN11G0V7">marches</a> [Reuters report] were organized by the National Front for the Family, an alliance of religious organizations and civil society groups, and spanned from Mexico's far north to the Yucatan peninsula. By the early afternoon, an estimated 40,000 people had come to protest in Queretaro, and 12,000 came to protest in Puebla, 7,000 more than city police had anticipated. Earlier this year the Mexico Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/mexico-president-proposes-legalizing-same-sex-marriage-nationwide.php">held</a> [JURIST report] that a state law defining marriage as being between a man and a woman was unconstitutional, and several states in Mexico already permit same-sex marriage, including Mexico City.</p>

<p>The lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender community (LGBT) continues to face legal challenges throughout the world. Last month the Belize Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/belize-top-court-strikes-down-anti-homosexuality-law.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law banning sodomy, declaring it unconstitutional and adversely impactful to the LGBT community. Last December voters in Slovenia <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/slovenia-voters-reject-same-sex-marriage-law.php">rejected a law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. In November the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples can legally adopt children. The UN has become increasingly focused on the rights of LGBT individuals. In September 2015 12 UN agencies <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">released a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] arguing that abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole. In June 2015 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-office-reports-continued-lgbt-discrimination.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A court in Kiel, Germany, ruled Friday that a 92-year-old woman charged with Nazi crimes is unfit to stand trial. The woman was identified only as Helma M. due to German privacy laws and is reportedly partially deaf, blind and suffering from an internal illness. Helma was <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/former-auschwitz-radio-operator-unfit-for-trial-german-court/a-19541126">charged</a> [AP/Reuters report] with being an accessory to the murder of 260,000 people while she worked as a radio operator at Auschwitz. According to prosecutors, Helma would <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/germany-seeks-to-prosecute-ex-ss-auschwitz-radio-operator-92/">receive</a> [<em>Times of Israel</em> report] reports of people sent to the camp during the time she worked there from April to July 1944.</p>

<p>German courts have recently seen an increase of war crime charges against former members of the Nazi party. Prior to 2011, German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard John Demjanjuk may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function. In December a German court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/auschwitz-paramedic-to-stand-trial-in-germany.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] the trial of a 95-year-old Auschwitz paramedic accused of being an accessory to the murder of 3,681 people at Auschwitz. In September 2014 German authorities imprisoned Oskar Groening, known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," who was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/germany-man-charged-in-more-than-300000-auschwitz-murders.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. Last year Groening was given a <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/ex-auschwitz-guard-senteced-to-four-years-in-prison.php">four-year jail sentence</a> for his role at Auschwitz, a sentence he said he would <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-aushwitz-guard-appeals-sentence.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20472&LangID=E">press release</a> [UN press release] issued on Friday, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IDPersons/Pages/IDPersonsIndex.aspx">Chaloka Beyan</a> [official profile], called upon Ukrainian officials to develop a comprehensive plan to address internally displaced persons (IDP), and provide durable solutions to the issue. Beyani urged the government "to intensify its efforts to protect the rights of IDPs from the conflict affected east of the country and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea." Despite commending the improvements the Ukraine has made, including adopting a law on internal displacement and creating a government agency who's sole function is to address this problem, the rights expert said that "more needs to be done to effectively implement the law and harmonise the resolutions under the law," and coordinate efforts between national agencies and local and municipal authorities. In particular, Beyani expressed dissatisfaction with the current registration system, the inefficiency of which has led to depriving IDPs of their pension and social payments. Beyani also discussed the concern with overall freedom of movement hampered by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Finally, the rights expert identified the need for durable housing, calling it a "key element of solution[]."</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea</a> [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In July AI and HRW released the 56-page report detailing how Ukrainian government officials and Russia-backed separatists in the Ukraine have subjected citizen to "prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">refusing necessary medical attention</a> [JURIST report]. In June the UN human rights office reported that the human rights situation in <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ukraine-rights-violations-persist.php">Ukraine remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia. In February <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/russia-files-lawsuit-against-ukraine-over-3-billion-eurobond-debt.php">Russia filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Ukraine over Ukraine's default on $3 billion in bonds. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">plans to sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the International Court of Justice on claims of financing terrorism. Last August a <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">Russian military court sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Ukrainian activists to substantial jail time for the charge of conspiring to commit terror attacks. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its policy of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">refusing to recognize Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The courts in China <a href="http://english.cctv.com/2016/09/12/ARTISddAyEgpeTxdbLFOmqtn160912.shtml">issued a statement</a> [text] Monday reiterating their dedication to human rights through the reformation of their criminal laws by upholding the presumption of innocence and the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence. This reformation comes as the UN has repeatedly criticized the country for the secrecy surrounding the judicial system and the manner in which prisoners are treated, especially political prisoners who may face particularly harsh prosecutions. The Chinese government has consistently <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-says-it-has-tightened-judicial-procedures-to-protect-human-rights">rejected criticism</a> [Reuters report] of its human rights record.</p>

<p>In July Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-china-must-end-oppression-of-human-rights-activistslawyers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Chinese authorities to "end their ruthless assault against human rights lawyers and activists." In February UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-chief-troubled-by-china-crackdown-on-lawyers-and-activists.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over China's recent crackdown on lawyers and activists. Chinese state media recently criticized detained human rights lawyers for undermining the rule of law. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion. Also in January <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hrw-china-unjustly-sentenced-human-rights-activists.php">Human Rights Watch urged</a> [JURIST report] the Chinese government to overturn a verdict sentencing three human rights activists in the Guangdong province to up to five years in prison. In December Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/prominent-china-rights-lawyer-released.php">released</a> [JURIST report] prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang after receiving a suspended sentence for "causing a disturbance" after he attended a weekend meeting that urged an investigation into the 1989 crackdown of pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.     </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israel's <a href="https://www.court.gov.il/heb/home.htm">High Court of Justice</a> [official website] ruled Sunday that the implementation of a law allowing the force-feeding of Palestinian prisoners on hunger strikes is constitutional. The court handed down the decision after ruling against petitions filed by the <a href="http://www.ima.org.il/Eng/Default.aspx">Israel Medical Association</a> [advocacy website] and other groups contesting the law that had been introduced last year. The UN had also <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16269&">issued a statement</a> [statement] condemning the practice at the introduction of the bill. The <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/israel-rejects-appeal-force-feeding-prisoners-160911192820011.html">court reasoned</a> [Al Jazeera report] that those who engage in a hunger strikes are not normal prisoners and that the court's top priority is to save lives, including those lives threatened by a hunger strike.   </p>

<p>The increase in violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created a contentious human rights situation. The UN Committee Against Torture (CAT), a body of independent experts, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">released</a> [JURIST report] closing remarks to its fifty-seventh session in May, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. An <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">Israeli court in April convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to a 50-day war in Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/PS/Pages/MakarimWibisono.aspx">Makarim Wibisono</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory after repeated requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian government and opposition groups began a ceasefire Monday following negotiations by the US and Russia. The ceasefire agreement was reached on Friday and although air strikes were carried out over the weekend, news outlets have <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37335829">reported calm</a> [BBC report] after sunset Monday. If all parties abide by the ceasefire for seven days, the US and Russia will <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/12/493584951/syrian-cease-fire-negotiated-by-u-s-russia-set-to-go-into-effect">coordinate</a> [NPR report] attacks on jihadist groups. The US currently supports opposition forces, and Russia supports the government of Syrian <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/world/meast/bashar-al-assad---fast-facts/">President Bashar Assad</a> [CNN profile]. The Free Syrian Army group and the Islamist Ahrar al-Sham both agreed to the ceasefire, although they are concerned that the ceasefire will later benefit Assad's government. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war surrounding the legitimacy of Assad. Last week a UN commission on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-investigators-violence-on-the-rise-in-syria.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] parties in the Syrian conflict to return to the "negotiation table" after a new report highlighted an increase of violence suffered by civilians. In August a top UN official submitted a report detailing an in-depth investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-syria-wracked-by-chemical-warfare.php">chemical warfare</a> [JURIST report] used by Islamic State and Assad in Syria. That same month Amnesty International said that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could amount to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-syria-chlorine-gas-attack-could-be-war-crime.php">war crime</a> [JURIST report]. In July Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. In June UN human rights experts called for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">immediate protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India's highest court <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2016-09-12_1473675832.pdf">ordered</a> [order, PDF] the state of Karnataka to share water with the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu on Monday. The two states have disputed rights to the Cauvery River for decades. Last week the court ruled that Karnataka must share 15,000 cubic feet per second for 10 days, but Karnataka appealed that decision. Karnataka officials <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/violence-southern-india-top-court-orders-water-sharing-092016681.html">argued</a> [AP report] that the state does not have enough water to share and that Tamil Nadu is not suffering <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/cauvery-water-dispute-partial-relief-for-karnataka-as-sc-modifies-earlier-order-3026898/">hardship</a> [<em>The Indian Express</em> report] over the water. The court ordered Karnataka to release 12,000 cubic feet per second instead of 15,000. After the decision violent protests erupted which led to attacks on hotels, shops, and buses. In response, police <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-37338613">deployed</a> [BBC report] 15,000 officers to the area and are prohibiting large public gatherings.</p>

<p>Water rights have been a major concern over the last year, particularly water contamination. In March Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was served with a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the water contamination in Flint, Michigan. In February BP supervisors were found <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bp-supervisor-found-not-guilty-of-clean-water-act-violation.php">not guilty</a> [JURIST report] of a Clean Water Act violation after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Also in February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-supreme-court-delays-epas-clean-power-plan.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which meant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In December a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/federal-appeals-court-preserves-epa-regulation.php">preserved</a> [JURIST report] the EPA's Mercury regulations that limit mercury and other hazardous pollutants from coal-fired power plants. In October the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/sixth-circuit-court-of-appeals-temporarily-blocks-clean-water-rule-enforcement.php">temporarily stayed</a> the EPA's new Clean Water Rule [JURIST report] for the Clean Water Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Zambia Supreme Court has denied an application by the country's main opposition party to stop Tuesday's inauguration of <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14112922">President Edgar Lungu</a> [BBC profile], a lawyer for the opposition party stated Monday. Lungu's inauguration had been postponed when <a href="http://hh-zambia.com/">Hakainde Hichilema</a> [campaign website], opposition leader of the United Party for National Development (UPND), <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/zambia-presidential-candidate-accuses-incumbent-of-electoral-fraud.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] contesting the results of the August 11 election. A single judge on the court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-zambia-election-idUSKCN11I1HE">rejected</a> [Reuters report] the application because he had no jurisdiction. The lawyer said that his clients intend to file another application before the supreme court en banc.</p>

<p>Zambia's presidency has been surrounded by controversy in recent years. In 2013 Zambian authorities <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/zambia-authorities-arrest-former-president.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] former president Rupiah Banda on allegations that he misappropriated over USD $11 million during his three-year tenure in office. Zambia's Supreme Court in 2010 <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/zambia-high-court-acquits-ex-presidents-wife-on-corruption-charges.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Regina Chiluba, the wife of former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba, of charges that she accepted stolen property during the years of her husband's administration. Prior to his wife's acquittal, former president Chiluba was <a href="/paperchase/2009/08/zambia-ex-president-acquitted-of.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] in 2009 of charges of stealing money from the country's treasury while in office from 1991-2001. He was ordered to <a href="/paperchase/2008/02/former-zambia-president-to-stand-trial.php">stand trial</a> [JURIST report] on the corruption charges in February 2008.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US Assistant Attorney General <a href="https://www.justice.gov/nsd/meet-assistant-attorney-general">John Carlin</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-islamicstate-idUSKCN11I1Z9">told reporters</a> [Reuters report] Monday that more than 110 people have been charged in federal court since 2013 on counts related to the Islamic State (IS) militant group. In more than 80 percent of these cases prosecuted, someone who had accused the person believed they had witnessed the activity for which the individual was charged. However, in more than half of those cases, the witnesses did not report the activity to the police until after the charges were made. Many IS supporters prosecuted were charged under "material support" statutes that criminalize supporting certain foreign terrorist groups. Carlin noted that supporting a domestic group in which some of its members have committed crimes should not be criminalized because it "runs into our Constitution and values" and gets "close to making illegal ideas."  The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] charged 60 people in 2015 with supporting or committing crimes due to sympathizing with IS, but the number arrested in 2016 has been lower than 2015's statistics.</p>

<p>IS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have been accused of war crimes on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria. In March US Secretary of State John Kerry <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/kerry-islamic-state-responsible-for-genocide.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that IS "is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims." Also in March the US House of Representatives unanimously passed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/us-lawmakers-pass-resolution-labeling-islamic-state-crimes-genocide.php">resolution</a> [JURIST report] denouncing the actions of IS as "genocide" and called for the establishment of international and domestic tribunals by UN member states. France's anti-terror prosecutor announced his decision last week to hand down <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/france-prosecutor-announces-harsher-prison-sentences-for-returning-french-jihadists.php">harsher criminal charges</a> [JURIST report], with sentences up to 30 years, for returning French jihadists from Iraq, Syria, and other areas where IS is actively involved.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Neubrandenburg state court in Germany on Monday started the trial of a 95-year-old former SS medic who served at the Auschwitz camp. Hubert Zafke is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trial-ss-medic-served-auschwitz-begins-germany-42026533">charged</a> [AP report] with 3,681 counts of accessory to murder for a one-month period at the camp. Zafke's trial was set to start in February, but the judge determined he was unfit to stand trial due to high levels of stress, high blood pressure and suicidal thoughts. The trial had also been postponed last year for concerns over Zafke's health. At the outset of trial, plaintiffs accused the judge of being biased and petitioned for him to be removed. Zafke was removed after two hours due to a spike in blood pressure, and the judge has stated that arguments on the motion for his removal must be heard before another session in the trial can occur.</p>

<p>German courts have recently seen an increase of war crime charges against former members of the Nazi party. A court in Kiel, Germany, ruled Friday that a 92-year-old woman charged with Nazi crimes is <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/germany-court-rules-92-year-old-woman-unfit-to-stand-trial-for-auschwitz-deaths.php">unfit to stand trial</a> [JURIST report]. Prior to 2011, German prosecutors often chose not to charge individuals they regarded as "cogs" in, rather than active members of, the Nazi war machine. The 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/05/demjanjuk-convicted-of-nazi-killings-released.php">conviction</a> [JURIST report] of former Nazi guard John Demjanjuk may have emboldened German prosecutors to pursue cases against all those who materially helped Nazi Germany function. In December a German court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/auschwitz-paramedic-to-stand-trial-in-germany.php">allowed</a> [JURIST report] the trial of a 95-year-old Auschwitz paramedic accused of being an accessory to the murder of 3,681 people at Auschwitz. In September 2014 German authorities imprisoned Oskar Groening, known as the "accountant of Auschwitz," who was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/germany-man-charged-in-more-than-300000-auschwitz-murders.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people. Last year Groening was given a <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/ex-auschwitz-guard-senteced-to-four-years-in-prison.php">four-year jail sentence</a> for his role at Auschwitz, a sentence he said he would <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/former-aushwitz-guard-appeals-sentence.php">appeal</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>White House press secretary <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/author/josh-earnest">Josh Earnest</a> [official profile] said Monday that US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] will <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/12/press-briefing-press-secretary-josh-earnest-9122016">veto</a> [press briefing] <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-114s2040rfh/pdf/BILLS-114s2040rfh.pdf">legislation</a> [text, PDF] that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. The Obama administration has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/12/politics/obama-9-11-victims-bill/">maintained this stance</a> [CNN report] as the legislation progressed through Congress. While legislators are expected to attempt an override, a success would be the first one during Obama's presidency. The bill has yet to be presented to Obama.</p>

<p>The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/us-house-approves-bill-allowing-911-families-to-sue-saudi-arabia.php">approved the legislation</a> [JURIST report] Friday, which would allow US nationals to seek relief from foreign governments if that entity is believed to have had involvement with a terrorist attack taking place within the US that caused physical damage to that citizen's person or property. The Act was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/us-senate-approves-bill-allowing-saudi-arabia-to-be-sued-for-911-attacks.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Senate in May. In 2012 a US District judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-dismisses-motion-to-reinstate-saudi-arabia-as-911-defendant.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Saudi Arabia as a defendant in a civil compensation lawsuit by victims against the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim against Saudi Arabia was dismissed in 2008 by a US Appeals Court due to insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes has actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the attacks. In 2005 Judge Richard Casey <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/rulings/03MDL1570_RCC_011905.PDF">dismissed</a> [PDF text; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">report</a>] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that all had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian <a href="http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/">Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull</a> will introduce legislation to hold a national vote on same-sex marriage after the plebiscite was approved by the <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/">Cabinet</a> [official websites] on Tuesday. The national vote would gauge voters' thoughts on the issue but would not actually legalize same-sex marriage as the parliament would still have to <a href="http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2016/09/13/cabinet-signs-off-on-february-11-plebiscite.html">decide</a> [SkyNews report] the issue. Under the prime minister's proposal, voters will be asked to respond on February 11 to the <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/turnbulls-plebiscite-warning-to-labor-get-out-of-the-way/news-story/cb410b3d4afa59b506e32a21a967324e">question</a>  [Australian report]: "Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?" The move is creating <a href="http://sarah-hanson-young.greensmps.org.au/content/media-releases/statement-marriage-plebiscite">opposition</a> [press release] by same sex-marriage advocates who believe the non-binding measure is delaying the granting of rights to same-sex couples. The vote is estimated to cost at least 7.5 million dollars. </p>

<p>The rights of same-sex couples are still being debated throughout the globe. Tens of thousands of people <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thousands-march-to-protest-same-sex-marriage-in-mexico.php">marched</a> [JURIST report] in Mexico in protest of same-sex marriage Saturday, a controversial topic in the country exacerbated by a proposal from embattled President Enrique Peña Nieto to recognize same-sex marriage. The Aruban legislature on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/aruba-votes-to-recognize-same-sex-unions.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to give official recognition to same-sex couples, giving them the right to register their unions and receive the benefits granted to other married people. The New York Court of Appeals <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/new-york-top-court-expands-definition-of-parent.php">ruled</a> [ JURIST report ] in August that the definition of "parent" under a section of the state's Domestic Relations Law should be expanded, in a decision that will serve to better accommodate same-sex couples. Also last month the Belize Supreme Court struck <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/belize-top-court-strikes-down-anti-homosexuality-law.php">down</a> [JURIST report] a law banning sodomy, declaring it unconstitutional. Section 53 of the Belize Criminal Code banned "carnal intercourse against the order of nature." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brazil's lower house of <a href="http://www2.camara.leg.br/english/the-brazilian-parliament">Congress</a> [official website] voted to <a href="http://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/fed/rescad/2016/resolucaodacamaradosdeputados-18-12-setembro-2016-783595-publicacaooriginal-151055-pl.html">expel</a> [press release] the formerly influential congress member Eduardo Cunha on Monday. The vote was largely in favor of ousting the lawmaker for "conduct incompatible with parliamentary decorum." Cunha was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/brazil-supreme-court-authorizes-corruption-trial-for-presidents-rival.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] by the Supreme Court with corruption for allegedly taking bribes from companies trying to secure oil contracts. The lower house decision banned Cunha from politics for eight years and he may be arrested now that he has lost his congressional prerogatives. Other politicians under investigation fear that Cunha could implicate others in a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/brazil-congress-expels-speaker-eduardo-cunha-160913034502300.html">"tell all" plea bargain</a> [Al Jazeera report] in relation to the Petrobras scandal.</p>

<p>Brazil's political establishment has been in turmoil as many powerful politicians have been brought to the center of embarrassing corruption investigations and trials. More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal, including the chief of staff under Brazil's former President Jose Dirceu and the former president Fernando Collor de Mellon. Cunha was the main supporter of the removal of ex-president Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-president-impeached-in-senate-vote.php">removed from office</a> [JURIST report] in September. While Rousseff was impeached, the Senate decided to allow her to run for public office in the future and she has <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/former-brazil-president-appeals-to-supreme-court-over-impeachment.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] to the Supreme Court following her removal from office.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=183271&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=394833">ruled</a> [judgment] Tuesday that UK courts may decide if the daughter-in-law of Abu Hamza poses a threat subject to triggering a deportation order. The case deals with the rights of immigrants and refugees who have committed crimes that create a deportation order but have children who are citizens of the host country. In this case CS was sentenced to serve at least a year of incarceration. Upon her release she was given a deportation order. She appealed arguing that the deportation would deprive her child of his rights and responsibilities as a citizen of the EU by subjecting him to removal by forcing his parents to leave. The British courts asked the ECJ to determine whether the courts had the power to expel a non citizen who is the primary caregiver of a citizen child. The ECJ held that the it is up to the courts to determine if the individual poses such a danger to the security of the nation that the removal of the individual and the citizen child should be expelled.<blockquote>Article 20 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State which requires a third-country national who has been convicted of a criminal offence to be expelled from the territory of that Member State to a third country notwithstanding the fact that that national is the primary carer of a young child who is a national of that Member State, in which he has been residing since birth without having exercised his right of freedom of movement, when the expulsion of the person concerned would require the child to leave the territory of the European Union, thereby depriving him of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of his rights as a Union citizen. However, in exceptional circumstances a Member State may adopt an expulsion measure provided that it is founded on the personal conduct of that third-country national, which must constitute a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat adversely affecting one of the fundamental interests of the society of that Member State, and that it is based on consideration of the various interests involved, matters which are for the national court to determine.</blockquote>.Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/australia-announces-plans-to-close-detention-center-on-manus-island.php">announced </a> [JURIST report] in August that the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea plan to close the controversial Manus Island detention center. Acting US Solicitor General Ian Gershengorn in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/solicitor-general-seeks-rehearing-of-obama-immigration-policy-before-supreme-court.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US Supreme Court  to reconsider  the case challenging the Obama administration's immigration enforcement program. The Supreme Court of Canada in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/canada-supreme-court-rejects-appeal-of-decision-in-former-nazi-citizenship-case.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an appeal by the Attorney General of Canada asking the court to review a lower court decision instructing the country to reconsider revocation of a former-Nazi's Canadian citizenship.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Kody Brown and his four wives filed the appeal after the <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-4117.pdf">threw out a constitutional challenge</a> [opinion, PDF; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-challenge-utah-polygamy-ban.php">report</a>] to <a href="http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010100.htm">Utah's anti-bigamy laws</a> [text]. They specifically want the Supreme Court to review a lower court decision upholding part of Utah's polygamy law banning cohabitation with other partners even when the man is only legally married to one woman.</p>

<p>In 2014 a judge for the <a href="http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of Utah</a> [official website] refused to dismiss the case as moot and proceeded to the merits, <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-partially-strikes-down-utah-polygamy-law.php">striking down</a> [JURIST report] portions of Utah's anti-bigamy statute. While polygamy is recognized in most of Africa and the Middle East, it is illegal in most of North and South America, Europe and China. In 2005 the US District Court for the District of Utah <a href="/thisday/2011/02/16/federal-judge-rejected-challenge-to-utah-polygamy-ban.php">rejected a similar lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] brought against Utah's Anti-Bigamy Statute, reaffirming the 1879 US Supreme Court case <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1104642225155375579">Reynolds v.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Thailand's military government announced on Monday that it will prosecute cases concerning national security and "royal insult" in civilian courts. Dissidents have been tried in military courts since the military seized power in 2014. Junta chief <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27526495">Prayuth Chan-ocha</a> [BBC profile] signed an order saying that these cases will be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-rights-idUSKCN11I14T">tried in civilian courts</a> [Reuters report] because of "an improving situation and cooperation from the public for the past two years." The cases currently in process will remain in military court. However, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] Asia Director Brad Adams says this decision is just <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/13/thailand-no-new-military-trials-civilians">"sleight of hand"</a> [HRW report] leading up to Thailand's Universal Periodic Review before the UN Human Rights Council later this month. </p>

<p>Thailand has been home to significant human rights concerns for years, some of which stem from the nation's court system. In particular, human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand since the military junta came to power in May 2014. Last week the Thailand Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailands-top-court-sentences-protest-leader-to-20-years.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 20-year prison sentence given to protest leader Sondhi Limthongkul in 2012. Last month, Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/thailand-passes-new-constitution-via-referendum.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a new constitution by referendum vote. The constitution was drafted by a military-appointed counsel and is feared to be another step in entrenching military control of the nation. Thai military officials in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/three-human-rights-defenders-charged-in-thailand-over-report-on-torture.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] three human rights defenders with criminal defamation and violations of the Computer Crimes Act because of a report they published detailing acts of torture in Thailand. In April Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/thailand-urged-to-revoke-military-police-powers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to stop harassing and charging human right lawyers for defending victims of the government's abuses, and to revoke military police powers. In March the Pheu Thai Party <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/thailand-government-accused-of-human-rights-violations.php">filed a complaint </a>[JURIST report] with the UN Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights over the detention of one of its key figures, Watana Muangsook, accusing the government of serious human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN expert on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20473&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] all nations to ensure that every existing and future trade agreement abides by and endorses all binding human rights treaties and environmental and health goals. In a statement accompanying release of a new <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/151/19/PDF/G1615119.pdf?OpenElement">report</a> [text, PDF], <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IntOrder/Pages/AlfredDeZayas.aspx">Alfred de Zayas</a> [official profile], the UN Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, expressed concern that private business enterprises have profited through trade agreements at the expense of human rights. The report introduces the idea of R2A, or responsibility to act in the public interest, which goes beyond the previously well-known <a href="http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/responsibility.shtml">R2P</a> [UN backgrounder], or responsibility to protect. De Zayas pointed to the investor-state-dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism, Investment Court System and the World Trade Organization dispute settlement mechanism as examples where pro-business bias has caused the sacrifice of human rights in pseudo-courts. </p>

<p>Many contemporary trade agreement issues stem from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which was <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/representatives-from-twelve-countries-sign-trans-pacific-partnership.php">signed in New Zealand</a> [JURIST report] in February and described by de Zayas as a "zombie of ISDS" with many "fundamental flaws." de Zayas' concerns on ISDS' were <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-rights-expert-investor-state-dispute-settlement-incompatible-with-democracy.php">expressed</a> [JURIST report] in April, where he expressed that they "are incompatible with democracy, the rule of law and human rights." ISDS mechanisms, which according to Zayas, provide for "privatized or semi-privatized dispute settlement" he warns, work against the public interest and allows calculated risks for profit in accordance with a "ideologically-driven corporate narrative." In February, de Zayas <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-expert-urges-countries-not-to-sign-pacific-trade-deal-without-reaffirming-rights-committments.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] all nations not to sign the TPP without first "reaffirming ... human rights treaty obligations and their recent pledges to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals." However, two days later 12 countries across the Pacific-Rim signed the TPP in New Zealand amid waves of protest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16A223-OH-Democratic-Party-v.-Husted-Order.pdf">refused to reinstate</a> [order, PDF] Ohio's Golden Week voting procedure, which allowed people to register and vote in the same week. Golden Week was the first five days of a 35-day early-in-person (EIP) voting system, prior to the end of registration before an election, and was popular with minority voters. Democrats <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/ohio-democrats-file-voting-rights-appeal-in-us-supreme-court.php">petitioned the Court</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate the period, stating that it "had played an exceptional, historic role in promoting voter registration in the past two Presidential elections, especially in minority communities." In opposition, the state noted that it remains easier to vote in Ohio than in many jurisdictions. The court issued only a one-sentence order and did not explain its ruling. </p>

<p>Earlier this month the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld cuts to early voting in Ohio as well as the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-upholds-ohio-early-voting-cuts.php">elimination of the Golden Week</a> [JURIST report]. The state's EIP voting system was a <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/09/another-day-another-election-law-battle-at-the-court/">response to the 2004 election</a> [SCOTUSblog report], in which some parts of the state experienced polling-line waits of up to 12 hours on the day of elections. A federal judge ruled in May that the reduction in the EIP voting practice <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/federal-judge-rules-ohio-early-voting-cuts-unconstitutional.php">was unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report] and in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, but the Sixth Circuit reversed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Sudan officials have said the country will take legal action against the US-based advocacy group, <a href="https://thesentry.org/">The Sentry</a> [website], after a <a href="https://thesentry.org/reports/warcrimesshouldntpay/">report</a> [materials] published by the group accused the nation's leaders of profiting from country's violent three-year conflict. The report, made public earlier this week, alleges that <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-12107760">President Salva Kiir</a>, former vice president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-25402865">Riek Machar</a> [BBC profiles] and other top officials have engaged in potentially illegal business dealings facilitated by a web of international lawyers, bankers, arms dealers and oil companies-all while their nation's people are forced from their homes. Representatives for the government have acknowledged the corruption taking place in South Sudan, but maintain that the report contains falsities based off of <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/sudan-legal-action-corruption-report-160913142407567.html">insufficient proof</a> [Al Jazeera report]. The two-year probe of South Sudan is the first investigative report published by The Sentry.  </p>

<p>This year alone, human rights concerns have been widespread concerning South Sudan. Earlier this month the world's youngest nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/south-sudan-agrees-to-additional-un-peacekeeping-forces.php">consented</a> [JURIST report] to the addition of another 4,000 UN peacekeeping troops to the existing force of 14,000 soldiers, under intense pressure from the UN, US and the rest of the international community. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said that South Sudan government) security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-south-sudan-government-forces-committing-widespread-violations.php">killed and raped citizens</a> [JURIST report] and looted and destroyed public and private property. In July Chaloka Beyani, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), condemned recent <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-expert-calls-for-end-of-hostilities-in-south-sudan.php">attacks on IDPs and civilians</a> [JURIST report] in South Sudan. In June UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">expressed shock</a> [JURIST report] at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries, including South Sudan. In May Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-south-sudan-detainees-held-in-inhumane-conditions.php">reported </a>[JURIST report] that dozens of detainees in South Sudan are being held in inhumane conditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20474&LangID=E">addressed</a> [text] the 33rd session of the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/pages/hrcindex.aspx">Human Rights Council</a> [website] Tuesday and condemned the trend of countries attempting to refuse human rights scrutiny under the UN. Many countries try to evade investigation by labeling the attention as "interference in the affairs of sovereign nations." Zeid observed that often times the reports issued by his office are misused or refuted as being "misleading." The high commissioner urged the council to continue to work together and maintain its credibility. He stressed human rights advocacy and endurance as the foundation of  society created out of the "sharpest and most profound necessity." The high commissioner praised nations which cooperate with the council, naming the Republic of Congo. He then denounced several nations who wither refuse to work with the UN, or refuse to acknowledge the UN and allow access.</p>

<p>In September 2016 alone the UN has been busy monitoring potential human rights abuses. Last week UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria urged parties in the Syrian conflict to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-investigators-violence-on-the-rise-in-syria.php">return to the "negotiation table"</a> [JURIST report] after a report highlighted an increase of violence suffered by civilians. Earlier this month a spokesperson from OHCHR expressed concern regarding the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-office-deeply-worried-about-cambodia-situation.php">intimidation of opposition politicians and peaceful protesters</a> [JURIST report] in Cambodia. Also this month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein unleashed a scathing <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-chief-criticizes-western-demagogue-leaders.php">criticism of Western "demagogues,"</a> [JURIST report] accusing them of spreading populist xenophobia and racism. In early September UN rights experts called for the creation of inclusive education programming to include those living with disabilities as a central and crucial step in order to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-experts-call-for-inclusive-education-to-combat-disability-discrimination.php">create peaceful and inclusive societies</a> [JURIST report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/tools/assets/files/0812.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] was filed in the <a href="https://www.mied.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan</a> [official website] on Tuesday alleging inadequate education facilities and standards in Detroit.  Seven students are <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuit-targets-detroit-public-schools-for-failing-students-1473808179">contending</a> [WSJ report] that the state of Michigan has denied them their constitutional right to literacy due to "infestations of mice and cockroaches, unqualified staffs, unsafe buildings, and inadequate teaching materials." The lawsuit is seeking class action status for those who attend school run by the Detroit Public School Community District. The suit was brought by <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/">Public Counsel</a> [advocacy website] as a pro bono matter. The suit <a href="http://www.publiccounsel.org/stories?id=0201">cites</a> [press release] numerous examples of inadequate education including an example where an eighth-grade student was forced to teach seventh and eighth-grade math because no teacher was available.</p>

<p>In recent years legislation surrounding education and teachers has generated controversy in the US. Earlier this year an education reform group, Students for Education Reform Minnesota <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/education-reform-group-challenges-minnesota-teacher-tenure-law.php">initiated a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the state claiming state laws governing teacher tenure violates students' fundamental rights to an education. In August 2014 education advocacy groups in New York challenged the state's <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/new-york-advocacy-groups-challenge-teacher-tenure.php">teacher tenure laws</a> [JURIST report], claiming that laws protecting teacher employment violate the civil rights of children to a quality education. In June of that year a judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court ruled that the California's system for tenure and seniority for public school teachers is <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/alifornia-court-strikes-down-teacher-tenure-system.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. In March 2014, the Supreme Court of Kansas held that the state's legislature violated the Kansas constitution when it <a href="/paperchase/2014/03/kansas-high-court-finds-public-school-funding-reductions-unconstitutional.php">underfunded K-12 public education</a> [JURIST report] during the 2009 through 2012 school years.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oklahoma will have a two-year delay in lethal injections after the government board of the prison system declined to consider new execution procedures on Tuesday. After a botched execution in 2014 and numerous drug mix-ups in 2015, <a href="https://www.ok.gov/oag/">Attorney General Scott Pruitt</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/files/pdf/ok-ag-press-release.pdf">refuses</a> [press release] to set execution dates until new protocols have been approved. After the botched execution, legislators approved the use of nitrogen gas an an alternative to lethal injection. There are currently five inmates who have exhausted all of their appeals and are awaiting an execution date. This November, a <a href="https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/questions/776.pdf">question</a> [resolution, PDF] will be placed on voting ballots asking whether or not Oklahomans want to incorporate the death penalty in their state constitution.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue in the US and worldwide. Last month the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/supreme-court-blocks-alabama-execution.php">upheld a stay</a> [JURIST report] of execution for Alabama inmate Vernon Madison. A few days before that a <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/miami-judge-florida-death-penalty-law-unconstitutional.php">Miami judge ruled</a> [JURIST report] that Florida's revamped death penalty law is unconstitutional because it does not require a unanimous agreement among jurors to approve executions. In April Virginia's General Assembly <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/virginia-passes-lethal-injection-drug-secrecy-bill.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to keep secret the identities of suppliers of lethal injection drugs. In February the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/federal-appeals-court-rejects-georgia-death-row-inmates-challenge.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a Georgia death row inmate's legal challenge to the death penalty. In January Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood stated that he plans to ask lawmakers to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/mississippi-ag-to-seek-approval-of-alternate-execution-methods.php">approve the firing squad</a> [JURIST report], electrocution or nitrogen gas as alternate methods of execution if lethal injection drugs become unavailable.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] on Tuesday said that the draft of the final outcome document for the upcoming UN summit on refugees falls short of dealing with the issue effectively. According to the rights groups, the UN is <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/383572eb03594a8fa7c6f916d3666e1e/2-human-rights-groups-criticize-un-over-refugees">missing an opportunity</a> [AP report] by not proposing anything of substance. Salil Shetty, Secretary General of AI, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/world-leaders-have-shirked-responsibility-on-refugee-crisis/">stated</a> [press release], "[f]aced with the worst refugee crisis in 70 years, world leaders have shown a shocking disregard for the human rights of people who have been forced to leave their homes due to conflict or persecution." Originally, the outcome document included a proposal that would require member states to annually be open to 10 percent of the world's refugee population. However, these proposals were removed from the final draft, leaving no concrete obligations regarding how member states must handle refugees. US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] will host a meeting of world leaders in New York after the summit to discuss refugee initiatives.</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/austria-threatens-lawsuit-against-hungary-over-migrant-acceptance.php">said</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that Austria will take Hungary to the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/court/index.php?p1=1">International Court of Justice</a> [official website] if Hungary does not begin accepting returning migrants that crossed into Austria from Hungary. Last month the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-bulgaria-arresting-migrants-cause-for-concern.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over Bulgaria's criminalization of migrants leaving and entering the country. In June the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-rules-uk-can-restrict-some-benefits-to-migrants.php">rejected a challenge</a> [JURIST report] to Britain's refusal to pay family welfare benefits to unemployed EU migrants who do not have the right to reside in the UK. The judges ruled that such unequal treatment is justified on the basis of protecting a member state's finances. Also in June the ECJ ruled that non-EU immigrants who illegally enter the Schengen area across an internal border <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-of-justice-holds-that-immigrants-that-illegally-cross-schengen-area-cannot-be-imprisoned-so.php">should not be jailed</a> [JURIST report] solely on that basis. In March the ECJ ruled that Germany may place <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/eu-court-rules-germany-can-require-refugees-to-live-in-certain-places.php">"residence conditions"</a> [JURIST report] on refugees. In February the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that new measures put in place by many European countries are <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-europe-placing-undue-hardships-on-refugees-and-asylum-seekers.php">too restrictive and place undue hardships</a> [JURIST report] on refugees and asylum-seekers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/topic/international-justice/bosco-ntaganda">Bosco Ntaganda</a> [HRW backgrounder; JURIST <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=ntaganda">news archive</a>], a former rebel in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has begun a hunger strike and is refusing to appear at his trial to protest the conditions of his detention. Ntaganda is on trial at the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on 18 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/drc/ntaganda">he has denied</a> [ICC materials]. The presiding judge recently decided not to remove visitation restrictions for Ntaganda out of fear he might interfere with witnesses, but the judge stated that these restrictions do not prevent family visits. However, Ntaganda stated that he does not believe he will be allowed to see his family under normal conditions, leading him to begin the strike and tell his legal team not to act on his behalf. In a written statement, Ntaganda stated that he feels he no longer has hope that he can defend himself, and that he is ready to die. The judge has ordered his defense team to continue representing him, but also ordered a medical assessment of Ntaganda. Additionally, the judge said that a family visit should be arranged right away.</p>

<p>Ntaganda's trial at the ICC began about a year ago, and he faces a maximum life sentence <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/trial-of-congo-war-crimes-suspect-begins-at-icc.php">if convicted</a> [JURIST report]. The rebel leader has pleaded innocent to the 18 charges levied against him, including rape, murder, recruitment of child soldiers and sexual slavery of civilians. He has been accused of killing at least 800 civilians between the years of 2002 and 2003 and keeping girl soldiers as sex slaves. In June 2014 the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2014/06/icc-confirms-war-crimes-charges-against-congo-rebel-leader.php">confirmed charges</a> [JURIST report] against Ntaganda. The ICC held the <a href="/paperchase/2014/02/icc-prosecutors-allege-congo-war-crimes-suspect-used-child-soldiers.php">confirmation of charges hearing</a> [JURIST report] in February 2014, reviewing approximately 69,000 pages of evidence. The previous year the ICC <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/icc-delays-preliminary-hearing-for-congo-war-crimes-suspect.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] the confirmation of charges hearing in order to give prosecutors more time to prepare their case. The pre-trial chamber concluded that Ntaganda bore individual criminal responsibility for specific attacks as well as war crimes during the ongoing conflict in the DRC, referring him for trial at a future date. The Congolese general <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/suspected-war-criminal-from-drc-surrenders-to-icc.php">voluntarily turned himself over</a> to the ICC in March 2013 following his <a href="/paperchase/2013/03/fugitive-congo-warlord-surrenders-at-us-embassy-in-rwanda.php">surrender to a US embassy</a> [JURIST reports] in Rwanda, marking the first time a wanted person has voluntarily surrendered to the ICC. Human Rights Watch had called for Ntaganda's arrest on multiple occasions: most recently a <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/hrw-congo-president-should-arrest-general-wanted-by-icc.php">direct appeal</a> in 2012 to DRC President Joseph Kabila and previously in 2011 <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/rights-group-urges-drc-to-arrest-war-crimes-suspect.php">during an international conference</a> after its <a href="/paperchase/2010/10/rights-group-urges-arrest-of-congo-general-for-war-crimes.php">previous request in 2010</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Several organizations filed a <a href="http://">federal lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Wednesday challenging Georgia's voter registration system. Since 2010, Georgia has <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawsuit-georgia-voter-registration-process-violates-law-42080632">required</a> [AP report] voter applications to match databases managed by the <a href="http://www.dds.ga.gov/">Georgia Department of Driver Services</a> and the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Administration</a> (SSA) [official websites]. Should a potential voter's identification information not match such databases, the state sends a notification to the person's residence and requires a response within 40 days before canceling the application. The state has noted that the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] was fully advised of this system in 2010 and that such measures are essential for preventing voter fraud. Plaintiffs <a href="http://www.naacpga.org/">Georgia State Conference of the NAACP</a> (GA NAACP), <a href="http://www.ncbcp.org/who/affiliates/georgia_coalition/">Georgia Coalition for the Peoples' Agenda</a> (GCPA) and the <a href="https://advancingjustice-atlanta.org/">Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Atlanta</a> [advocacy websites] have argued, however, that the state's system is unconstitutional and violates the <a href="http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/PPL_VotingRightsAct_1965.pdf">Voting Rights Act </a> [text, PDF] by preventing many state residents from registering to vote. The organizations also claim in their lawsuit that the state system disproportionately affects minorities who may not have the proper knowledge to remedy any hindering application errors. The lawsuit requests that the judge terminate the current system and allow state residents with previously canceled applications to vote in the upcoming election. </p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. Last week the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-appeals-court-blocks-voter-proof-of-citizenship-requirement-in-three-states.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] a proof of citizenship requirement imposed upon voters by Alabama, Georgia and Kansas. Earlier this month the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-denies-michigans-request-to-ban-straight-ticket-voting.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Michigan's appeal of an <a href="http://media.mlive.com/news_impact/other/Injunction.pdf">injunction</a> [text, PDF] that prevented the state from ban straight-ticket voting. The Supreme Court also denied a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">motion to reinstate </a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's recently overturned law that limited early voting to 10 days and required voters to present approved identification cards. Last month the <a href="http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-reconsider-wisconsin-voter-id-law.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] an emergency petition for a rehearing regarding the Wisconsin voter ID law. Also last month the Illinois Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/illinois-supreme-court-blocks-redistricting-proposal-from-ballot.php">concluded</a> [JURIST report] that placing a redistricting proposal on the ballot this fall would be unconstitutional. Earlier in August an Oklahoma court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial voter identification law allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. In July voter restrictions were overturned not only in North Carolina, but in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Legislators in Turkmenistan on Wednesday <a href="http://tdh.gov.tm/index.php/ru/2013-04-29-11-55-24/2013-04-13-07-33-53/18377-2016-09-14-23-39-27">amended</a> [press release, in Russian] the nation's constitution to allow <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gurbanguly-Berdymukhammedov">President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow</a> [Britannica profile], to remain in power indefinitely. Berdimuhamedow <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkmenistan-president-idUSKCN11K0L3">praised the amendment</a>[Reuters report], which not only extended the presidential term by two years, from five to seven, but also removed the 70-year age limit to be an eligible candidate. President Saparmurat Niyazov, Berdimuhamedow's predecessor remained in power until his death in 2006.</p>

<p>The extension of presidencies has been an issue in many nations, including Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Earlier this year UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-sg-urges-african-leaders-to-avoid-using-loopholes-to-cling-to-power.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] African leaders to avoid using loopholes and undemocratic constitutional changes to "cling to power." Violence in Burundi began in the wake of President Pierre Nkurunziza's announcement that he would seek a third term of office, which he was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">voted into</a> [JURIST report] last year. Earlier this year the UN High Commission for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-chief-warns-against-increasing-violence-in-burundi.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] of increasing violence in Burundi. Last year the UN Human Rights Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-resolution-approves-investigations-into-burundi-human-rights-abuses.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a resolution to dispatch experts to investigate human rights violations in Burundi, condemning violence in the country, use of excessive force by officials and restrictions on freedoms. In October the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) electoral commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/congo-voters-approve-referendum-extending-presidential-term-limits.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that voters have approved an amendment to the constitution that would allow President Denis Sassou Nguesso to extend his term in office. In January of last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-drc-using-excessive-force-against-protestors.php">protests and demonstrations</a> [JURIST report] took place across the DRC to oppose the proposed changes in the law that would allow President Joseph Kabila to extend his presidential term past the allotted two-year limit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A transgender non-citizen from Mexico filed a <a href="http://transgenderlawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Filed-Complaint-Doe-v-Pence.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Tuesday against Indiana <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/2358.htm">Governor Mike Pence</a> [official profile] and two other state officials over Indiana's law that prevents non-citizens from changing their names. The law was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/transgender-man-challenges-indiana-law-on-changing-name-1473798116">enacted</a> [WSJ report] in 2010 to prevent identity theft and was primarily aimed at undocumented immigrants, though it equally affects immigrants residing in the US legally. The anonymous plaintiff has argued in the lawsuit, however, that the law subjects transgender non-citizens to harassment by not allowing them to assume a name that reflects their self-identified gender. The <a href="http://transgenderlawcenter.org/">Transgender Law Center</a> and the <a href="http://www.maldef.org/">Mexican American Legal Defense Fund</a> (MALDEF) [advocacy websites] are supporting the lawsuit and have stated the Indiana law discriminates based on national origin and violates the privacy protections of transgender persons. The state officials have yet to publicly respond to the lawsuit. </p>

<p>The lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender community (LGBT) continues to face legal challenges throughout the world. On Saturday tens of thousands of people <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thousands-march-to-protest-same-sex-marriage-in-mexico.php">marched</a> [JURIST report] in Mexico in protest after President Enrique Peña Nieto's announced intention to recognize same-sex marriage. Last month the Belize Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/belize-top-court-strikes-down-anti-homosexuality-law.php">struck down </a> [JURIST report] a law banning sodomy, declaring it unconstitutional and adversely impactful to the LGBT community. Last December voters in Slovenia <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/slovenia-voters-reject-same-sex-marriage-law.php">rejected a law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. In November the Constitutional Court of Colombia <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples can legally adopt children. The UN has become increasingly focused on the rights of LGBT individuals. In September 2015 12 UN agencies <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">released a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] arguing that abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole. In June 2015 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-office-reports-continued-lgbt-discrimination.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Chelsea Manning ended her five-day <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/chelsea-manning-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-prison-treatment.php">hunger strike</a> [JURIST report] Wednesday after the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/chelsea-manning-ends-hunger-strike-government-agrees-move-forward-recommended-gender-affirming">Army agreed</a> [ACLU press release] to allow her to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Manning, a former military private serving a 35-year prison sentence on an espionage conviction after leaking classified files to Wikileaks, said in a statement to the <a href="https://www.aclu.org"> American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] that she is "unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right thing. I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted&#8212;for them to let me be me."</p>

<p>According to the ACLU, Manning was being <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/chelsea-manning-facing-new-charges-after-suicide-attempt.php">investigated</a> [JURIST report] in July for charges in relation to a suicide attempt at the facility. At the time, ACLU Staff Attorney Chase Strangio issued a statement in which he was deeply critical of the Army's handling of Manning, in particular the "denial of medical care related to her gender transition" despite "the treatment [being] recognized as necessary." The report went on to say that the Army continued to deny necessary medical care to Manning, including medical treatment following her suicide attempt. <a href="/sidebar/2012/08/philip-cave-manning-public.php">Manning's trial</a> [JURIST op-ed] began in 2013 and the subsequent litigationhas garnered much debate. In May Manning <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/chelsea-manning-appeals-35-year-sentence.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her 35-year prison sentence. In 2013 Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">filed for a presidential pardon</a> [JURIST report] of the 35-year sentence. The sentence came a month after <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">she was found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act, but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." The judge had <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">raised the burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] in order to require the government to prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against her for providing classified materials to Wikileaks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human rights groups, including the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites], are <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/13/why-president-obama-should-pardon-edward-snowden-now">calling</a> [HRW press release] on US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> to pardon former <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official websites] contractor <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-22837100">Edward Snowden</a> [BBC profile] with a campaign <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/leaving-edward-snowden-in-limbo-will-be-a-stain-on-president-obamas-legacy/">launched</a> [AI press release] on Wednesday.  The <a href="https://pardonsnowden.org/">Pardon Snowden campaign</a> [advocacy website] seeks to gain supporters to pressure the current administration to pardon Snowden on the belief that he performed a public service by leaking classified information as well as the probability that he would not be able to receive a fair trial if prosecuted for his alleged crimes. The groups are encouraging individuals to sign their name to the petition on the website in order to create public backing for the pardon.<blockquote>But the 1917 Espionage Act, under which Snowden is charged, makes no allowance for whether a leak is in the public interest or what the leaker's motivations are. All that matters is whether the leaks were shared with someone unauthorized to receive them, regardless of whether that someone is a foreign enemy or a reputable journalist. When Daniel Ellsberg was charged under this antiquated law for leaking the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times, a judge prevented Ellsberg from answering the question why he did it. Saying Snowden can explain his actions in court is simply wrong&#8212;under this law he can't.</blockquote>The groups are also raising the issue of whistle-blower protection and rights. </p>

<p><br />
Snowden, a former NSA contractor and computer professional, became famous in 2013 for leaking classified information. His leak ultimately led to significant revelations about global mass surveillance programs employed by various governments, particularly the US. Last October the European Parliament voted <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/european-parliament-vote-to-protect-snowden-from-extradition.php">to approve </a>[JURIST report] a resolution encouraging its member countries not to extradite Snowden and called upon its member states to drop all criminal charges against him and offer him protection as an "international human rights defender."  The ACLU and other US human rights organizations challenged the surveillance by the NSA, although the US District Court for the District of Maryland <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-judge-dismisses-challenge-to-nsa-surveillance.php">dismissed one such case</a> [JURIST report] last October. The <a href="/forum/2013/07/tung-yin-edward-snowden.php">question of Snowden's guilt </a>[JURIST op-ed] and the legitimacy of the charges against him have been <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=5%2C4%2C6%2C&search=Snowden&limit=25&page=&author=&filtered=true&narrow=&authored=false">debated and analyzed</a> [JURIST news archive] widely in the U.S.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/">Missouri legislature</a> [official website] on Wednesday <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/senate-successfully-overrides-the-governor-13-times/">overrode</a> [press release] vetoes by <a href="https://governor.mo.gov/">Governor Jay Nixon</a> [official website] to approve bills requiring voter identification and removing the need to renew permits in order to carry a concealed weapon. <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billsummary.aspx?bill=HB1631&year=2016&code=R">HB 1931</a> [materials] requires individuals to present a government-issued photo ID in order to vote, which the governor stated would cause <a href="http://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills161/rpt/HB1631vl.pdf">unnecessary harm</a> [veto letter, PDF] to vulnerable populations. However it will not change the voting procedures for the upcoming Presidential election as the bill is not set to take effect until 2017. <a href="http://www.senate.mo.gov/16info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=22246426">SB 656</a> [materials] expands the rights of gun owners by protecting concealed carry individuals from arrest for carrying their weapons onto private properties where guns are prohibited and creating lifetime concealed carry permits. The lifetime permits, which may last either 10 or 25 years, allow individuals the right to concealed carry without having to go through the renewal process every five years, but do require the sheriff to perform background checks for criminal conduct every five years. The National Rifle Association  <a href="https://www.nraila.org/articles/20160914/nra-applauds-veto-override-of-senate-bill-656-in-missouri">applauded</a> [press release] the move while opponents <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-senate-overrides-bill-allowing-concealed-carry-without-a-permit/article_c98fc4f9-b85b-5810-9ccd-1e28d62f2651.html">argue</a> [<em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> report] the bill will create more issues for safety and order.  </p>

<p>Last month an Oklahoma court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial voter ID law allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. In July voter restrictions were overturned not only in <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">North Carolina</a>, but in <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports]. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-authorities-may-require-permits-for-concealed-handguns-in-public.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in June that the right to carry a concealed gun is not within Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released <a href="https://adam.amnesty.org/asset-bank/action/viewAsset?id=232528">images</a> [video footage, <a href="https://adam.amnesty.org/asset-bank/images/assetbox/6c1c3b2d-2df7-4be5-b093-72675f60eb65/assetbox.html">satellite images</a>] from the "desert no man's land" between Jordan and Syria on Thursday showing thousands of refugees trapped in the area. The images show how dire the humanitarian situation has become, displaying makeshift grave sites and an estimated 75,000 refugees trapped in the area known as the Berm. Tirana Hassan, Crisis Response Director at AI, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/syria-jordan-border-75000-refugees-trapped-in-desert-no-mans-land-in-dire-conditions/">commented</a> [press release] on the images stating<blockquote>It's a desperate picture for people trapped at the berm, food is running out and disease is rife. In some cases people are suffering or even dying from preventable illnesses, simply because they are not allowed into Jordan and the authorities have blocked access for aid, medical treatment and a meaningful humanitarian response.</blockquote>AI has called for meaningful dialogue and international action to address the refugee crisis as world leaders plan to meet in New York next week for the UN and Obama summits.</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. Earlier this month Human Rights Watch and AI <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/rights-groups-un-summit-falling-short-on-refugee-issues.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that the draft of the final outcome document for the upcoming UN summit on refugees falls short of dealing with the issue effectively. Also in September UNICEF <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/unicef-children-uprooted-by-violent-conflicts.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] that found that nearly 50 million children have been uprooted from their homes across the globe. In April in April UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-sg-urges-governments-to-accept-more-refugees.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] world leaders to accept more refugees and to combat the growing international anti-refugee sentiments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently appointed Kosovo war crimes prosecutor David Schwendiman of the <a href="http://sitf.eu/index.php/en/">Special Investigative Task Force</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-warcrimes-kosovo-idUSKCN11L1KY">vowed</a> [Reuters report] to investigate all war crime suspects, "fairly, vigorously and without fear" on Thursday. Many of the suspected offenders are former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and now hold important political positions. Additionally, many are viewed by ethnic Albanians as freedom fighters. It is suspected that President Hashim Thaçi may have played a role in war crimes committed against Serbs during the conflict. The court, <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/kosovo-war-crimes-court-to-be-established-in-the-hague.php">established</a> [JURIST report] in January, will operate under the authority of the <a href="http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/?page=2,1">EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo</a> (EULEX) [official website]. Although the court will be under Kosovo law, it will be located in the Netherlands, funded by the EU, and the judges and prosecutors will be internationals. Registrar Fidelma Donlon said the court hoped to commence judicial activity in the first half of 2017. </p>

<p>Failure to fully prosecute war crimes committed during the 1998-99 Kosovo conflict contribute to the continued strain between Serbian and Kosovo relations. EULEX was established to aid Kosovo in the rule of law application when it comes to instances such as war crimes that may cause conflict with in the region. In June the Assembly of Kosovo <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/kosovo-assembly-votes-to-extend-eu-mandate.php">voted to extend</a> [JURIST report] the EULEX mandate for two years. The move comes after the EU voted to extend and fully fund the mandate until 2018. Kosovo's Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/kosovo-approves-new-war-crimes-court.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the creation of the special war crimes court in August of last year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new UN <a href="http://ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine15thReport.pdf">report</a> [text, PDF] released Thursday found a dismal situation in eastern <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18018002">Ukraine</a> [BBC profile] with regards to human rights. As a result of escalating hostilities the past few months, the report cites an increasingly disturbing disregard for the protection of civilians by both sides during the conflict. The report <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20496&LangID=E">found</a> [OHCHR press release] a 66 percent increase in conflict-related civilian casualties from May through August. The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) [official website] has recorded 9,640 deaths and 22,431 injuries among Ukrainian armed forces, civilians and members of the armed groups since the conflict began over two years ago. The majority of civilian casualties have resulted from shelling and a considerable number have also been killed by mines and other booby traps. Civilians in these areas are deprived of protection and access to services and aid and are unable to move. Furthermore, there have been countless cases of torture, ill-treatment and detention.</p>

<p>Russia and Ukraine have been in conflict since the <a href="/feature/featured/ukraine/detail.php">annexation of Crimea [JURIST backgrounder] in March 2014. In July AI and HRW released the 56-page report detailing how Ukrainian go</a>vernment officials and Russia-backed separatists in the Ukraine have subjected citizen to "<a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-civilians-face-detainment-disappearance-and-torture-in-ukraine.php">prolonged, arbitrary detention," torture, or other forms of inhumane treatment, including refusing necessary medical attention</a> [JURIST report]. In June the UN human rights office reported that the human rights situation in <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-ukraine-rights-violations-persist.php">Ukraine remains troublesome</a> [JURIST report] following two years of conflict with Russia. In February <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/russia-files-lawsuit-against-ukraine-over-3-billion-eurobond-debt.php">Russia filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against Ukraine over Ukraine's default on $3 billion in bonds. A Ukrainian official said in January that the nation plans to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ukraine-to-take-russia-to-international-court-of-justice.php">sue Russia</a> [JURIST report] in the International Court of Justice on claims of financing terrorism. Last August a Russian military court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/un-serious-rights-concerns-persist-in-ukraine.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] two Ukrainian activists to substantial jail time for the charge of conspiring to commit terror attacks. In March of last year the EU committed to stand by its policy of <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/european-union-will-stick-to-its-policy-of-not-recognizing-russias-annexation-of-crimea.php">refusing to recognize Crimea's annexation</a> [JURIST report].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="http://www.house.gov/">House of Representatives</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5351/actions">approved</a> [HR5351 actions] a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/hr5351/BILLS-114hr5351eh.pdf">bill</a> [text, PDF] that would temporarily block the transfer of detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The bill, which passed with a 244-174 vote, would <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/politics/guantanamo-bay-house-bill-terrorism/">prevent</a> [CNN report] transfers until a 2017 military budget is passed or until President Barack Obama leaves office. The Obama administration has cleared 20 of the remaining 61 detainees for transfer. The bill is not expected to survive as the White House has <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/09/15/House-passes-bill-to-block-Barack-Obamas-Guantanamo-transfers/9661473955343/">threatened</a> [UPI report] to veto even if the bill does pass through the Senate. Proponents of the bill argue it is necessary due to the <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/FINAL%20-%20GTMO%20Unclass%20CDA%20Response%20-%20September%202016.pdf">recurrences of recidivism</a> [DNI report]. To date, more than 693 detainees have been released during the Bush and Obama administrations, 122 of whom are known to have returned to militancy, while others are "suspected" of having returned to terrorist activity.</p>

<p>Last month Vice President Joe Biden stated at a press conference in Sweden that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/vice-president-biden-expects-guantanamo-to-close-before-president-leaves-office.php">hopes and expects</a> [JURIST report] that the Guantanamo prison will be closed before Obama leaves office. Also last month the US Department of Defense <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/us-transfers-15-guantanamo-detainees-to-uae.php">announced the transfer</a> [JURIST report] of 15 Guantanamo detainees to the United Arab Emirates. Earlier in August a US Senator <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/pentagon-report-discourages-guantanamo-closure.php">released a Pentagon Report</a> [JURIST report] detailing the profiles of those currently detained in and recently released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) concluded that closing the facility would not be in the US' best interests and would pose a safety risk. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told Fox News in January that Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/white-house-official-obama-plans-to-close-guantanamo-before-leaving-office.php">intends to fulfill</a> [JURIST report] his promise to close the Guantanamo detention facility before leaving office. Last November the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/us-senate-approves-defense-spending-bill-prohibiting-transfer-of-guantanamo-detainees-to-us.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), which prohibits Guantanamo detainees from being transferred into the US. Obama signed the bill into law, despite the fact that it could delay his plan to close the prison. The NDAA comes after the <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/defense-department-reviewing-colorado-prisons-as-alternative-to-guantanamo-bay.php">DOD said</a> [JURIST report] they were sending teams to review three Colorado prisons as part of Obama's efforts to close the facility last October. The Guantanamo Review Task Force was created in response to a 2009 presidential executive order to review the status of all detainees. In September White House Spokesperson Josh Earnest said Obama was <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/wh-spokesperson-obama-still-considering-options-to-close-guantanamo.php">considering a "wide array" of options"</a> [JURIST report] for closing the prison.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] will work to prosecute environmental crimes, according to a <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/itemsDocuments/20160915_OTP-Policy_Case-Selection_Eng.pdf">policy paper</a> [text, PDF] <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int//Pages/item.aspx?name=pr1238">published</a> [press release] Thursday detailing how the court will select and prioritize cases. The court made the paper available to the public in order to increase "transparency" but clarified that the paper is an "internal document" that gives rise to no "legal rights" and is "subject to revision" as experience mandates. The court noted that it will begin prosecuting "illegal exploitation of natural resources, arms trafficking, human trafficking, terrorism, financial crimes, land grabbing or the destruction of the environment...," which some have noted as a <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2016-09-15/icc-prosecutors-signal-new-focus-on-environmental-crimes">marked shift</a> [AP report] from their primary focus on crimes committed during armed conflict.</p>

<p>Environmental destruction has been an issue plaguing much of the world, including the US. Last week environmentalists <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/environmentalists-sue-epa-over-water-quality-standards.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the US Environmental Protection Agency regarding federal water quality standards. In March Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was served with a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the water contamination in Flint, Michigan. In February BP supervisors were <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bp-supervisor-found-not-guilty-of-clean-water-act-violation.php">found not guilty</a> [JURIST report] of a Clean Water Act violation after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Also in February the <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-supreme-court-delays-epas-clean-power-plan.php">Supreme Court blocked</a> [JURIST report] the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which meant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. <br />
In January, a Hungarian court  <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hungary-court-acquits-15-employees-connected-to-2010-toxic-red-sludge-spill.php">acquitted </a>[JURIST report] 15 employees of the Mal Corp for their role in the toxic red sludge spill that killed 10 people in 2010 after a reservoir burst. Also in January, Brazil's Federal Police <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/brazil-alleges-environmental-crimes-in-investigation-into-dam-collapse.php">accused seven people and three companies of environmental crimes</a> [JURIST report] in its probe into the major Fundão dam collapse that occurred on November 5. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The EU <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">General Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d59058742d02d84ac588acb5dcf054633a.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4Pa3qLe0?text=&docid=183372&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=938354">upheld sanctions</a> [judgment] against former Ukrainian president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25182830">Viktor Yanukovych</a> [BBC profile]. Following an uprising in 2014, Yanukovych fled to Russia, and the EU imposed sanctions for embezzlement and wrongdoing. Yanukovych successfully challenged the sanctions from March 2014 to March 2015 due to lack of evidence, but the court upheld the sanctions from March 2015 to March 2016. The EU has extended the sanctions to 2017, and Yanukovych's lawyer says he <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-crisis-eu-idUKKCN11L1VW?il=0">plans to challenge</a> [Reuters report] those sanctions as well.</p>

<p>Russia has also received financial sanctions from the EU. In June a senior adviser to the European Court of Justice <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/eu-court-adviser-sanctions-against-russia-legally-valid.php">submitted an advisory opinion</a> [JURIST report] finding the July 2014 EU economic sanctions against Russia legally valid. In 2014 the Russian discount airline Dobrolet <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/eu-adopts-new-sanctions-against-russia.php">suspended all flights</a> [JURIST report] as a result of the tightening EU sanctions. The EU responded that the airline's service from Moscow to Crimea "facilitate[d] the integration of the illegally annexed Autonomous Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and undermines Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity." The economic sanctions against Russia were expected to cause more damage to the Russian economy than those imposed earlier that year, though economists and analysts expected Western economies to be impacted by them as well. The sanctions targeted the country's energy, banking and defense sectors and included a ban on the purchase or sale of new bonds, stocks or long-term debts from some Russian banks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Swedis appellate court in Stockholm on Friday <a href="http://www.svea.se/Pages/173150/Order%20%C3%96%207130-16.pdf">upheld the arrest warrant</a> [order, PDF; <a href="http://www.svea.se/Om-Svea-hovratt/Nyheter-fran-Svea-hovratt/Decision-in-the-case-concerning-the-detention-of-Julian-Assange/">press release</a>] and detention order issued six years ago against <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-11047811">Julian Assange</a> [BBC profile]. The warrant, which Assange has challenged multiple times, was issued in 2010 in connection with sexual assault charges involving two women he met in Sweden at the time. Assange has consistently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/16/swedish-court-upholds-julian-assange-arrest-warrant">maintained his position</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that any and all sexual relations with the two women were consensual and that these charges were politically motivated. Assange has thus far avoided extradition to Sweden by staying at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and the detention order seeks to bring Assange in for questioning. UN officials have determined Assange's six-year detention order without charge is an <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-wikileaks-founder-arbitrarily-detained-should-be-released.php">arbitrary detention</a> [JURIST report] and thereby unlawful, but the court rejected this determination as not binding on Sweden. The court further stated that Assange's stay at the embassy cannot be regarded as an "unlawful deprivation of liberty." Sweden's prosecutors are currently planning to interrogate Assange sometime within the next few months while Assange remains inside the embassy in England. Meanwhile, Assange's lawyers are currently planning to appeal the decision to the Sweden Supreme Court.   </p>

<p>This is the eighth time that the arrest warrant against Assange was challenged in a Sweden court and all of the rulings thus far have gone against Assange. Assange concerns about being extradited to Sweden primarily relate to his fear of being extradited by Sweden to the US on espionage charges in connection with his role, as founder of <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> [advocacy website], in the release of classified US government materials to the public The <a href="/forum/2011/06/ashley-savage-whistleblowing.php">WikiLeaks trials</A> [JURIST op-ed] have also garnered much debate in the US. Last year US Army Major General Jeffery Buchanan <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/army-general-denies-chelsea-mannings-request-for-clemency.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] Private Chelsea Manning's conviction and prison sentence for turning over classified information to WikiLeaks. In September 2013 Manning filed for a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">presidential pardon</a> of the <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/wikileaks-defendant-sentenced-to-35-years-for-espionage.php">35-year sentence</a> [JURIST reports] she received in August. The sentence came a month after she was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Federal appeals court: mental health prohibtion on gun ownership may be unconstitutional</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/16a0234p-06.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that a decades-old federal prohibition against gun ownership by people committed to mental health institutions could violate the Second Amendment, reviving a challenge to the law. The case was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-appeals-court-rules-mental-health-ban-on-gun-ownership-may-violate-rights-1473973368">brought</a> [WSJ report] by 74-year-old Clifford Tyler, who was committed to a mental health institution 25 years ago but has since been discharged on a clean bill of health. Writing for the majority, Judge Julia Gibbons applied an intermediate scrutiny test to the government prohibition on gun ownership by a specific class of persons&#8212;those previously committed to mental health institutions. While acknowledging that the government presented compelling evidence "of the need to bar firearms from those currently suffering from mental illness and those just recently removed from an involuntary commitment," the court stated that the evidence does not establish "why Congress is justified in permanently barring anyone who has been previously committed, particularly in cases like Tyler's, where a number of healthy, peaceable years separate the individual from their troubled history." Thus, the court noted that the government failed to "establish a reasonable fit between its important objectives of public safety and suicide prevention and its permanent ban on the possession of firearms by persons adjudicated to be mentally unstable" years ago but since recovered. Judge Karen Nelson dissented, stating that precedent supported the prohibitions on the ownership of firearms by the mentally ill as "presumptively lawful" and that "[t]he legislature as opposed to the judiciary is far better equipped ... to make sensitive public policy judgments (within constitutional limits) concerning the dangers in carrying firearms and the manner to combat those risks." The case has been remanded to the trial court for a determination on the constitutionality of the continued prohibition on gun ownership by Tyler.</p>

<p>This decision comes in the wake of the <a href="http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit</a> [official website] ruling last week that <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-appellate-court-restores-gun-rights-for-offenders-in-minor-crimes.php">restored</a> [JURIST report] gun ownership rights of individuals convicted of minor crimes. Gun control and the Second Amendment continue to be controversial topics across the US. Earlier this month the New Jersey Second Amendment Society <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/second-amendment-group-challenging-stun-gun-ban.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a lawsuit against the state's Attorney General in New Jersey's district court alleging the state's stun gun ban is unconstitutional. In June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-upholds-firearm-prohibitions-for-reckless-domestic-violence.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a state law conviction on reckless domestic assault is sufficient to bar possession of a firearm under federal law. Earlier in June Hawaii Governor David Ige <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/hawaii-governor-signs-bill-to-put-gun-owners-on-fbi-database.php">signed a bill</a> [JURIST report] requiring gun owners to be listed on an FBI database, notifying police if a Hawaii citizen is arrested in another state and providing a continuous criminal record check on those individuals seeking to possess a firearm. Also in June the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-declines-to-rule-on-assault-weapons-bans.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in two separate cases challenging bans on assault-style weapons. The court denied the appeals without comment, letting stand lower court rulings that had <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-upholds-state-automatic-weapons-bans.php">upheld the bans</a> [JURIST report] as constitutional. In response to the mass killing in Orlando in June, the UN's top human rights official <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-chief-calls-for-increased-gun-control-in-us.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the US to increase its gun control measures. The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/federal-appeals-court-authorities-may-require-permits-for-concealed-handguns-in-public.php">held</a> [JURIST report] in June that the right to carry a concealed gun is not within Second Amendment right to bear arms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> [official website] on Thursday advanced a bill that would extend the statute of limitations for Holocaust families and heirs trying to retrieve artwork seized by Nazis during World War II. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2763">Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act</a> [materials] was <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20160915-families-that-lost-art-to-nazis-could-get-help-under-bill-advancing-in-senate.ece">introduced</a> [<em>Dallas Morning News</em> report] in April and co-authored by Texas senators <a href="https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/about">John Cornyn</a> and <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=about_senator">Ted Cruz</a> [official profiles] with the intention of allowing rightful heirs to have their day in court. In support of the bill, Cornyn has stressed the importance of bringing further justice to Holocaust victims and restoring their lost culture. Cornyn also amended the bill to not retroactively apply to  those that have already declined the opportunity to pursue a claim for any artwork of interest. The bill was passed by the committee on a unanimous vote and is expected to be approved by the full senate. </p>

<p>The new bill is meant to fulfill a 2009 agreement made between the US and several other countries to fairly resolve disputes over Nazi-seized artwork. Should the bill pass, it will aid families who have often struggled with museums to reclaim their lost artwork. In June Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, <a href="http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2016/06/senate-eyes-help-for-families-who-lost-art-to-nazis-a-cause-that-brings-cornyn-and-cruz-together.html/?_ga=1.123563721.372838329.1474048238">claimed</a> [<em>Dallas Morning News</em> report] that museums and collectors have demonstrated a pattern of "running the clock" to keep Holocaust artwork away from their rightful owners. Courts have also tended to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/senate-panel-advances-bill-to-help-heirs-recover-art-lost-to-nazi-looting/">side with museums</a> [AP report] in court disputes over such artwork. Last month a California judge sided with a museum in a 10-year dispute over Nazi-seized art after determining that the family abandoned the art by not seeking restitution. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debt bondage remains the world's <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20504&LangID=E">leading form of slavery</a> [press release] despite being outlawed in many regions, according to a <a href="https://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/824017.375707626.html">report</a> [text, PDF] presented Thursday by a UN human rights expert. UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery Urmila Bhoola explained that many people do not understand the complexities of debt bondage. She also reported that the experts at the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/lang--en/index.htm">International Labor Organization</a> [official website] estimate some 21 million people are currently in forced labor because of the practice, which tends to target those in impoverished communities. </p>

<p>Since 2014, it has been estimated that <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/36-million-living-in-modern-slavery-report.php">approximately 36 million people in the world live in a form of modern slavery</a>, which has been <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/un-sg-calls-for-end-to-modern-slavery.php">condemned by the UN for years</a> [JURIST reports]. Global Slavery Index has defined slavery as: "one person possessing or controlling another person in such as a way as to significantly deprive that person of their individual liberty, with the intention of exploiting that person through their use, management, profit, transfer or disposal." <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-sg-calls-for-international-support-to-end-human-trafficking.php">Modern slavery also includes</a> [JURIST report] the increase in human trafficking of migrants and the refugee population. With a vote of 14 in favor, the UN Security Council introduced a resolution last October to allow the EU to inspect and seize vehicles suspected of smuggling migrants. Authorized under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the resolution permits certain nations to board ships in order to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/un-authorizes-operation-to-prevent-migrant-smuggling-in-libya.php">prevent human trafficking</a> [JURIST report]. The previous month, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch had announced that the <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/department-of-justice-receives-44-million-dollar-grant-to-fight-human-trafficking.php">Department of Justice will fund</a> [JURIST report] a $44 million grant to fight human trafficking.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.senate.gov/index.htm">US Senate</a> [official website] approved <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6061?resultIndex=5">legislation</a> [materials] Thursday amending the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/title-xiv-public-health-service-act-safety-public-water-systems-safe-drinking-water-act">Safe Drinking Water Act</a> [materials] to provide $100 million in emergency funding to repair pipes in cities suffering from lead contamination, such as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/us/flint-water-crisis">Flint, Michigan</a> [CNN backgrounder]. The amendment also makes grant money available so educational agencies may carry out testing for and remediation of lead contamination in their local schools. There are 29 projects supported by the measure, including those aimed to restore Florida's Everglades and improve flood prevention in Louisiana. Passed in a <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/3badd3a273a5460689f254ea95e3a150/senate-approves-bill-water-projects-millions-flint">95-3 vote</a> [AP report], the Act still requires approval by the House. The bill would provide $10 billion overall to support water initiatives. </p>

<p>Water contamination has been a major concern over the last year. In March Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was served with a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">class action lawsuit </a>[JURIST report] over the water contamination in Flint, Michigan. In February <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bp-supervisor-found-not-guilty-of-clean-water-act-violation.php">BP supervisors were found not guilty</a> [JURIST report] of a Clean Water Act violation after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Also in February the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-supreme-court-delays-epas-clean-power-plan.php">blocked</a> [JURIST report] the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which meant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In December a federal appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/federal-appeals-court-preserves-epa-regulation.php">preserved the EPA's Mercury regulations</a> [JURIST report] that limit mercury and other hazardous pollutants from coal-fired power plants. In October the Sixth Circuit temporarily stayed the<a href="/paperchase/2015/10/sixth-circuit-court-of-appeals-temporarily-blocks-clean-water-rule-enforcement.php"> EPA's new Clean Water Rule</a> [JURIST report] for the Clean Water Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former president of Brazil,  <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-10841416">Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> [BBC profile], on Thursday denounced charges filed against him in a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35810578">corruption scandal</a> [BBC backgrounder] involving more than 50 of the country's politicians. The <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-lula-da-silva-says-criminal-charges-aimed-at-reversing-his-successes-1473965934">charges</a> [WSJ report], including corruption and money laundering, were filed on Wednesday. The former president speculated that the charges may be a method used by prosecutors to tarnish the 13-year reign of his political party, the Worker's Party. Brazilian authorities allege that da Silva and his wife orchestrated a ring of criminal activity, which benefited the couple through power and money. Authorities are investigating $6.2 billion worth of illegal contracting between da Silva and oil company, <a href="http://www.petrobras.com/en/home.htm">Petróleo Brasileiro</a> [website]. For now, the charges only center on the money da Silva and his wife allegedly used for personal expenses.  </p>

<p>More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal that continues to plague the country as it prepares for the upcoming summer Olympics. In July da Silva <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-appeals-to-un-for-rights-violation-in-corruption-investigation-1.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a petition with the UN Human Rights Committee, claiming that his corruption investigation has been riddled with impartiality and abuse of power by the judge. In May Brazil's Supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-house-speaker-suspended-for-obstructing-corruption-investigation.php">suspended </a>[JURIST report] lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha after being suspected of obstructing investigations into his allegedly corrupt activities. Also in May local media in Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-call-for-investigation-of-president.php">reported </a>[JURIST report] that the country's top prosecutors had requested an investigation into sitting-President Dilma Rousseff over alleged connections to the Petrobras corruption scandal. In April the Supreme Federal Court in Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the legislature to commence impeachment proceedings against Vice President Michel Temer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AfricaRegion/Pages/SSIndex.aspx">UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20509&LangID=E">concluded</a> [press release] its first visit to South Sudan on Thursday and expressed concern regarding the ongoing pattern of human rights violations in South Sudan. The Commission was <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-southsudan-rights-idUKKCN11L279">established</a> [Reuters report] in March to monitor human rights issues in the city amidst an ongoing war between warring factions. Though the government has stated that it properly addressed rights abuses, Commission leader Yasmin Sooka has pointed to the government's consistent oppression of civil society. Sooka stated that the country intimidates the public and more specifically endangers the freedom of press by cracking down on journalists. Sooka further accused the government of not promoting accountability for serious abuses such as the sexual assault of females and possible war crimes. The Commission, with the support of the US and Britain, called for the establishment of a hybrid court that would allow countries to choose lawyers and jurists and address human rights abuses in South Sudan. </p>

<p>This year alone, human rights concerns have been widespread concerning South Sudan. On Wednesday South Sudan officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/south-sudan-threatens-to-sue-us-watchdog-group.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] they would take legal action against US advocacy group The Sentry after the group accused the nation's leaders of profiting from the country's three-year conflict. Earlier this month the government <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/south-sudan-agrees-to-additional-un-peacekeeping-forces.php">consented</a> [JURIST report] to the addition of another 4,000 UN peacekeeping troops to the existing force of 14,000 soldiers, under intense pressure from the UN, US and the rest of the international community. Last month UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said that South Sudan government security forces have <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-south-sudan-government-forces-committing-widespread-violations.php">killed and raped citizens</a> [JURIST report] and looted and destroyed public and private property. In July Chaloka Beyani, UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons (IDPs), condemned recent <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-expert-calls-for-end-of-hostilities-in-south-sudan.php">attacks on IDPs and civilians</a> [JURIST report] in South Sudan. In June UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-chief-concerned-over-increase-in-abduction-and-killing-of-children-by-governments.php">expressed shock</a> [JURIST report] at the increasing number of children recruited and killed in armed conflicts in several countries, including South Sudan. In May Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-south-sudan-detainees-held-in-inhumane-conditions.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that dozens of detainees in South Sudan are being held in inhumane conditions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] USA Today, the Associated Press and Vice Media on Friday filed a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/324233733/AP-Vice-Gannett-v-FBI-Complaint">federal complaint</a> [text] against the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) [official website] seeking to learn how the government was able to overcome <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/us/syed-farook-tashfeen-malik-mass-shooting-profile/">Syed Farook</a>'s [CNN backgrounder] iPhone's encryption allegedly without Apple's help. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] initially filed suit against Apple in an attempt to force them to unlock Farook's iPhone after he was involved in the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/specials/san-bernardino-shooting">San Bernardino killings</a> [CNN backgrounder]. In March, the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/doj-drops-case-attempting-to-force-apple-to-unlock-iphone.php">dropped the case</a> [JURIST report] against Apple, stating that they had another method of unlocking the phone. Apple's refusal to assist the government sparked controversy over digital privacy rights, which came to an anticlimactic end when the FBI used a third-party tool to overcome the iPhone's security measures. Now, the media outlets seek to know what third-party tool was used, to what extent it may be used in the future and what security vulnerabilities the tool takes advantage of. </p>

<p>At the end of February Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-files-objections-to-order-to-unlock-iphone.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a brief in the US District Court for the Central District of California in opposition of the US government's request for the company to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook. Counsel for Apple called the case "unprecedented" after the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/doj-files-motion-to-compel-apple-to-unlock-shooters-phone.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a motion to compel Apple to unlock the encrypted iPhone. In response to the legal conflict, Apple <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/apple-asks-congress-to-create-expert-panel-on-privacy-issues.php">asked</a> [JURIST report] the US government to create a panel of experts to discuss issues of security versus privacy. The court order <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-magistrate-orders-apple-to-assist-us-government-in-unlocking-individuals-phone.php">required</a> [JURIST report] Apple to supply software to the FBI to disable a self-destruct feature that erases phone data after 10 failed attempts to enter the phone's password.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UK Prime Minister <a href="http://www.tmay.co.uk/">Theresa May</a> [official website] on Saturday <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/claims-theresa-said-brexit-process-8855656">denied</a> [Mirror report] EU President <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/">Donald Tusk</a>'s [EU profile] report that May intends to begin <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html">Article 50</a> [text] proceedings by February. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/what-article-50-means-brexit-8272464">Article 50</a> [Mirror backgrounder] is the portion of the EU Constitution governing procedures for nations seeking to leave the Union, and is the next step in UK's withdrawal. Speaking at a summit in Bratislava, Slovakia, Tusk <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/09/16-tusk-final-remarks-bratislava/">stated</a> [press release], "Prime Minister May was very open and honest with me. She declared that it's almost impossible to trigger Article 50 this year but it's quite likely that they will be ready maybe in January, maybe in February next year." May's administration asserts that Tusk's statements were an interpretation of the leaders' more broad discussion on the topic that contained no dates. </p>

<p>A majority of British citizens <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/uk-citizens-vote-to-leave-eu.php">voted to leave</a> [JURIST report] the EU in June. Concern over the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZB090">economic health of Britain</a> [Reuters report] going into the future led to a global market plunge following the vote, as the pound fell as far as ten percent against the US dollar; a low not seen since 1985. While the vote has fallen in favor of departure, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/21/legal-implications-britain-votes-leave-eu-brexit">no legal changes have taken place yet</a> [Guardian report] as Britain must take further steps to confirm its separation. However, Britain's leading public-interest law firm, as well as several experienced litigators, are <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/uk-lawyers-to-challenge-eu-referendum.php">currently drafting</a> [JURIST report] a legal challenge to trigger a parliamentary debate. Under Article 50, a member country can only be removed from the EU two years after notification. While Britain might bypass this process through repeal of the European Communities Act of 1972, it is believed that this would make coming to a preferential trade agreement with the EU more difficult.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.acluct.org/">Connecticut ACLU</a> [official website] filed a <a href="http://www.acluct.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ACLUCT_Picard-v.-Torneo-Jacobi-Barone-Complaint-.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Thursday against three officers on behalf of a DUI-checkpoint protester, Michael Picard. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHNROh5Tfkk&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Video footage</a> [video] was soon after released showing the officers discussing bringing false charges against Picard. Picard had been approached by the officers during one of his protests. The officer noticed Picard had a pistol in his hip holster and checked to see if he had a valid pistol permit. The video shows Picard's camera being taken by one of the officers, who instructed him "it's illegal to take my picture." The camera continued to record audio while the officers then deliberated on what charges they would levee against Picard, eventually settling on use of a highway by a pedestrian and creating a public disturbance for having his pistol in plain view of passing vehicles. Picard's charges were recently dropped. The complaint alleges violations of both Picard's First Amendment right of free speech and Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure. The Connecticut State Police Union said that they believed the lawsuit is "frivolous and will ultimately be dismissed" on Friday.</p>

<p>Citizen rights and police authority, including stop and frisk procedures, continue to be an issue throughout the US. Last September, a Ferguson reform panel <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/09/ferguson-commission-recommends-police-reform.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] calling for the consolidation of police departments and municipal courts. Just a month prior, the Chicago Police Department <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/08/chicago-allows-independent-stop-and-frisk-evaluation-under-agreement.php">decided</a> [JURIST report] to allow independent evaluations of their stop and frisk procedures that many have said specifically target African Americans under an agreement with the ACLU. In August 2014, New York City <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/08/nyc-drops-appeal-in-nypd-stop-and-frisk-lawsuit.php">formally dropped</a> [JURIST report] the city's appeal of rulings in lawsuits involving the New York Police Department's (NYPD) use of stop-and-frisk tactics. Mayor Bill De Blasio's administration agreed to end the lawsuit against the NYPD after reaching a settlement requiring three years of NYPD oversight by a court-appointed monitor.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/16/technology/wells-fargo-lawsuit/">class action lawsuit</a> [CNN report] was filed on Friday in a US District Court in Utah against <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/corporate/">Wells Fargo</a> [corporate website] by customers alleging invasion of privacy, fraud, negligence, and breach of contract. Over the past five years, Wells Fargo has opened millions of fake bank and credit card accounts for customers in hopes of earning extra fees from the customers and artificially inflating sales figures. The customers are seeking damages for identity theft, anxiety, emotional distress, and legal fees. This is the first lawsuit against the banking giant for the fraudulent accounts, but it appears that further legal action may come as the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> [official website] has already begun an investigation into the matter, and the US <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> [official website] <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=401022">announced</a> [press release] on Friday it would be opening an investigation into the bank and would hold a hearing sometime in the upcoming weeks.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, Wells Fargo has been the subject of various administrative and judicial action. Earlier this month, the Consumer Protection agency <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/09/consumer-agency-fines-wells-fargo-us-100-million.php">fined</a> [JURIST report] Wells Fargo $100 million for various violations, including the opening of fraudulent accounts. In 2014, a US District Court <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-approves-final-settlement-in-wells-fargo-investment-case.php">approved a $62.5 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the bank and large institutional clients who lost money in a securities lending program. In 2013, a federal judge <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2013/05/wells-fargo-ordered-to-pay-203-million-for-misleading-customers.php">imposed a $203 million penalty</a> [JURIST report] against the bank in a class-action suit alleging the bank misled customers and charged excessive overdraft fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Russian officials, a US-led airstrike which killed Syrian troops on Saturday could threaten the ceasefire agreed upon between Syrian and opposition forces. Russia said over 60 Syrian troops <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37400810">were killed</a> [BBC report] as a result of the airstrike. <a href="http://www.centcom.mil/">US Central Command</a> [official website] said they believed they were targeting ISIS positions, and stopped the operation as soon as Russia informed that the targets may be Syrian military. However, Russia and Syria have accused the US of planning the attack. On Saturday night, Russia <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/17/syria-says-us-led-jets-hit-its-troops-dozens-reported-killed.html">ordered</a> [CNBC report] an emergency session of the UN Security Council to discuss the airstrikes. The Syrian government and opposition groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/syria-ceasefire-agreement-takes-effect.php">began the ceasefire</a> [JURIST report] Monday following negotiations by the US and Russia. The two countries planned to coordinate attacks on jihadist groups after seven days of the ceasefire. The US currently supports opposition forces, and Russia supports the government of Syrian President <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/06/world/meast/bashar-al-assad---fast-facts/">Bashar Assad</a> [CNN profile].</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war surrounding the legitimacy of Assad. Last week a UN commission on Syria <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-investigators-violence-on-the-rise-in-syria.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] parties in the Syrian conflict to return to the "negotiation table" after a new report highlighted an increase of violence suffered by civilians. In August a top UN official submitted a report detailing an in-depth investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-syria-wracked-by-chemical-warfare.php">chemical warfare</a> [JURIST report] used by Islamic State and Assad in Syria. That same month Amnesty International said that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could amount to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-syria-chlorine-gas-attack-could-be-war-crime.php">war crime</a> [JURIST report]. In July Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. In June UN human rights experts called for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">immediate protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Russia holds national elections for 450 seats in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-national-elections-duma-tarred-by-violation-claims/">claims of election fraud</a> [CBS report] and other violations began to surface on Sunday. One election monitoring group in Golos has already received more than 1,300 complaints, and Ilya Shablinsky, a coordinator of observers for the presidential Council on Human Rights, said that "[i]nformation about violations is coming constantly from various regions." Among the various instances of voter fraud include young people voting in the name of elderly citizens unlikely to vote and poll workers dropping multiple sheets of paper into ballot boxes. Questions still remain as to whether these instances will incite protests similar to those in 2011, following the last Duma election.</p>

<p>This would not mark the first time Russia's election process has drawn ire, both domestically and internationally. In 2011, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) stated that the Russian election was <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2011/12/international-election-fraud-monitor-concerned-about-russia-election-process.php">"characterized by frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulation."</a> [JURIST report] There were allegations of voting fraud in both the 2007 and 2008 Russia elections as well. In 2008 the <a href="http://assembly.coe.int/">Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)</a> [official website] <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2008/03/russia-presidential-election-observers.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about Russia's presidential elections due to alleged media restrictions and polling irregularities. In 2007 election monitoring groups <a href="http://www.transparency.org/">Transparency International</a> [advocacy website] and Golos stated that Russia's parliamentary elections were <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2007/12/russia-parliamentary-elections-were.php">rife with fraud and corruption</a> [JURIST report]. Election observers from PACE and OSCE said the parliamentary elections were <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2007/12/fraud-claims-cloud-putin-party-win-in.php">"not held on a level playing field"</a> [JURIST report] due to strong media bias towards Putin and the United Russia party leading up to the election, widespread reports of harassment of opposition parties and a new election code that made it more difficult for smaller political parties go gain the seven percent of the vote necessary to serve on the State Duma. They also called Putin's merging of the state with the United Russia party an abuse of power.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3110202-SPECIAL-STATUS-REPORT-v5-9-16-16.html">report</a> [text] compiled by <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">California State University, San Bernardino</a> [official website] and released on Saturday found an increase in hate crimes in 2015, particularly among Muslims and Arab-Americans. The study compiled data from 20 states, representing over 53 percent of the national population. Overall hate crimes across the 20 states increased by about 5 percent. However, hate crimes against Muslims increased by 78 percent. The number of Anti-Muslim hate crimes committed in these twenty states alone (196) is so high that even if no other hate crimes were reported in any other states, it would still signal the highest increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes since shortly after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Hate crimes against Arab-Americans increased by over 200 percent and attacks against Transgender individuals increased about 40 percent, although the researchers warn this could be affected by improvements in data collection. The director of the <a href="http://hatemonitor.csusb.edu/">Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism</a> [official website] at the university believes the rise <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/us/politics/hate-crimes-american-muslims-rise.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0">may be caused</a> [NYT report] in part by the political discourse in the country, and a slight increase has been noticed after a candidate makes incendiary comments about the Muslim population. Official statistics for 2015 from the FBI are due to be released in November.</p>

<p>In recent years, Muslims have faced increased discrimination in the United States and other western countries. Last month, France's highest administrative court, the Council of State <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/france-court-overturns-burkini-swimsuit-ban.php">overturned</a> [JURIST report] the ban on full-body "burkini" swimsuits in the French city of Cannes, although authorities have continued attempts to ban the garment in the cities of <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/france-court-strikes-down-nice-burkini-ban.php">Nice</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/france-court-upholds-local-burkini-ban.php">Bastia</a> [JURIST reports]. In January, the New York Police Department (NYPD) <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/nypd-reaches-settlement-in-muslim-surveillance-cases.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to a settlement in two civil rights lawsuits accusing the NYPD of wrongfully monitoring Muslims after the 9/11 attacks. Two years earlier, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/new-york-city-asks-court-to-dismiss-nypd-muslim-surveillance-suit.php#.U06WWPldVhE">admitted</a> [JURIST report] that the NYPD spied on mosques and on a Muslim preacher but requested that the court dismiss the complaint. In 2015, The French Human Rights League and the Collective against Islamophobia <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/france-muslim-group-files-suit-alleges-government-abuse-after-paris-attacks.php">issued a statement</a> [JURIST report] urging the French government to lift the state of emergency as members of the French Muslim population alleged abuse and unfair targeting of Muslims. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website], world leaders meeting at the United Nations will <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54916#.V9776_BpE2x">focus heavily</a> [UN News Centre] upon the Syria conflict, refugees and the environment on Monday. Particularly, the Secretary General said the talks need to facilitate "progress in resolving protracted conflicts and rising tensions in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East" and "continue the momentum towards implementing...our plan of action for peace and prosperity on a healthy planet." The Secretary General was adamant that the international community must address the world's refugees and migrants, a step they believe has been taken by the adoption of the Declaration at the <a href="http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/summit">Summit for Refugees and Migrants</a> [official website]. He also expressed that "while many conflicts are causing enormous pain, none is causing so much death, destruction and widespread instability as the worsening war in Syria," calling for continued intra-Syrian negotiations. Finally, Ban pushed for the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jurist.org/feature/featured/syria-1/">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war surrounding the legitimacy of Assad. Last week a UN commission on Syria <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/09/un-investigators-violence-on-the-rise-in-syria.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] parties in the Syrian conflict to return to the "negotiation table" after a new report highlighted an increase of violence suffered by civilians. In August a top UN official submitted a report detailing an in-depth investigation into <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/08/un-syria-wracked-by-chemical-warfare.php">chemical warfare</a> [JURIST report] used by Islamic State and Assad in Syria. That same month Amnesty International said that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could amount to a <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-syria-chlorine-gas-attack-could-be-war-crime.php">war crime</a> [JURIST report]. In July Human Rights Watch <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. In June UN human rights experts called for the <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">immediate protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Egyptian court on Saturday froze assets of five notable human rights activists and three NGOs for allegedly accepting foreign funds without governmental authorization. Though a criminal proceeding has yet to take place, this <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/egypt-court-freezes-assets-rights-defenders-ngos-160917144339206.html#">order</a> [Al Jazeera report] likely spells criminal indictments for those groups and individuals for "pursuing acts harmful to national interests." If found guilty, the individuals could face up to 25 years in prison. Many believe this action is politically motivated. Amnesty International <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/09/egypt-asset-freeze-is-a-shameless-ploy-to-silence-human-rights-activism/">called the court order</a> [press release] a "shameless ploy to silence human rights activism," and called for the court order to be invalidated.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13315719">Egypt</a> [BBC timeline] has been internationally scrutinized in recent months over allegations of human rights infringements and free speech violations. Of particular concern is the prosecution and imprisonment of journalists by the Egyptian government, which has garnered widespread criticism from governments and rights groups worldwide. In March Egypt Justice Minister Ahmed al-Zind was relieved of his position after he stated that he would even imprison the Prophet Mohammed in response a question regarding the imprisonment of journalists. In January non-governmental organizations issued a <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/ngos-issue-statement-to-egyptian-parliament-on-enforcement-of-constitutional-and-human-rights.php">joint statement</a> [JURIST report] to the Egyptian parliament giving recommendations to ensure the enforcement of constitutional and human rights. In December Egyptian lawyer Nasser Amin <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/egypt-lawyer-challenges-censorship-law.php">challenged a law</a> [JURIST report] that allows writers to be jailed for writings that violate Egyptian "morals." In August 2015 Egyptian President <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19256730">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a> [BBC profile] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/egypt-passes-sweeping-anti-terrorism-legislation.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a 54-article counter-terrorism law that has been met with significant controversy, as many believe it infringes on the freedom of the press. Many have said that the law defines terrorism too broadly and imposes harsh sentences and fines on violators. The same month <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/hrw-new-egypt-counterterrorism-law-threatens-press.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the law saying it infringes on freedom of the press.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants on Monday, UN experts are <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20521&LangID=E">urging</a> [statement] states to protect women and girls in the movement of refugees and migrants by adhering to international human rights conventions and standards, including the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/cedaw.pdf">Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women</a> and the <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001435/143557e.pdf">International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families</a> [texts, PDF]. Migrant women and girls are at a high risk of gender-based violence while in transit and may also face intersecting forms of discrimination based race, nationality, or religion. The joint statement also notes it is important for countries to recognize the socio-economic contributions made by women, although their work is often undervalued. The experts believe this will benefit countries by giving a voice to more migrant women and girls.</p>

<p>UN committees and working groups have advocated for the rights and protection of women throughout the world. In a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-experts-women-with-disabilities-should-be-empowered.php">statement</a> [JURIST report] released last month, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that women with disabilities face discrimination and are often excluded from freely participating in society. In June the UN Working Group on Discrimination against Women in Law <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-address-womens-health.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] the world's governments to take quick, effective steps towards ensuring women are granted equal rights to health, including reproductive and sexual health. UN officials last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/un-rights-experts-press-for-end-to-female-genital-mutilation.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to female genital mutilation, including the medicalization of the practice. In January 2015 a group of UN human right experts <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/un-rights-experts-urge-el-salvador-to-pardon-women-jailed-for-pregnancy-related-complications.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] El Salvador to pardon all women jailed for illegal abortions as a result of pregnancy complications or rape. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory filed a <a href="http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wtvd/docs/HB2%20Dismissal%20Eastern%20District%20(002).pdf">Notice of Voluntary Dismissal</a> [text, PDF] on Friday to withdraw a lawsuit in which the state sought a judgment declaring that the <a href="http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v4.pdf">Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act</a> [text, PDF], also known as House Bill 2 (HB 2), did not violate federal law. HB 2 prevented cities and counties from enacting laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity. In the notice, McCrory claimed that the defendants, the US and the US <a href="http://www.doj.gov">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] caused delays in the case by requesting a motion to dismiss and utilizing all of the time allotted to file an answer. The federal government also sued North Carolina over HB 2 in the <a href="http://www.ncmd.uscourts.gov/">Middle District of North Carolina</a> [official website] in a suit that was consolidated with cases brought forth by the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website]. The state's Notice of Dismissal states that North Carolina's arguments are already asserted as counterclaims in the the case brought forth by the DOJ, and McCrory is withdrawing this lawsuit because of "the substantial costs to [North Carolina] of litigating similar legal issues in two different judicial districts, and the interests of judicial economy and efficiency."</p>

<p>North Carolina's stance on LGBT rights has been a topic of national controversy. In April McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/north-carolina-governor-seeks-to-clarify-controversial-transgender-law.php">issued an executive order</a> [JURIST report] to clarify HB 2 in response to significant backlash. In March North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper stated during a press conference that he <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-ag-refuses-to-defend-transgender-law-in-court.php">would not defend</a> [JURIST report] the law, which he considers to be discriminatory against the LGBT community. Earlier that week North Carolina individuals and civil rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-sue-north-carolina-governor-regarding-new-transgender-law.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against McCrory, claiming that the bill he signed one week prior was unconstitutional and discriminatory. Earlier that month McCrory <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/north-carolina-governor-signs-controversial-transgender-bill-into-law.php">signed the bill into law</a> [JURIST report], preventing local governments from enacting their own nondiscrimination ordinances and making them unable to pass laws allowing transgender people to use the public restroom or locker room that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] called upon Pakistani authorities Monday to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/19/pakistan-dont-execute-man-mental-disability">stop the execution</a> [press release] of Imdad Ali, a mentally disabled man, which is scheduled for Tuesday. HRW expressed its belief that "executing people with mental health conditions is an affront to decency and serves no criminal justice purpose," and violates Pakistan's international legal obligations. The report cites various international organizations and compacts that call into question and prohibit execution of individuals suffering from psycho-social disabilities as violations of the right to be free from cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which Pakistan is a party. Imdad Ali was sentenced to death in 2002 for murdering a religious scholar and was diagnosed with psychosis and later paranoid schizophrenia. Despite these diagnoses, Imdad Ali has had several appeals denied by the Lahore High Court and Pakistan Supreme Court, and also has had a mercy petition denied by the Pakistan president. In addition to his mental illness, Imdad Ali has been held in solitary confinement for the last three years, which human rights experts have stated amounts to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment and can further exacerbate any mental infirmities. Pakistan currently has one of the world's largest death row populations with more than 8,000 prisoners currently facing the death penalty.</p>

<p><a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">Capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue worldwide. Last month a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-expert-condemns-iran-execution-of-12-drug-offenders.php">expressed "outrage"</a> [JURIST report] regarding Iran's execution of 12 people for drug-related charges. In July Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated that he would <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">approve reinstating the death penalty</a> [JURIST report] so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly. In May a spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-office-condemns-iran-sentencing-of-human-rights-activist.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Iranian authorities for the sentencing of Nargis Mohammadi, an anti-death penalty activist. Also in May UN rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-chief-welcomes-pfizer-measures-to-prevent-use-of-drugs-for-executions.php">welcomed</a> [JURIST report] the measures being taken by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to prevent the use of its drugs in state-sponsored execution by lethal injection. UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-experts-condemn-belarus-use-of-death-penalty.php">human rights experts expressed</a> [JURIST report] grave concern earlier that month over Belarus' death penalty practices after reports surfaced that a man was executed while his case was before the UN Human Rights Committee.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.scj.ro/">Romanian High Court</a> [official website] is expected to rules Tuesday on whether to recognize the marriage of a same-sex couple. US citizen Claibourn Robert Hamilton and Romanian activist Adrian Coman were married in Belgium and have <a href="http://coman.acceptromania.ro/cazul-coman-hamilton/?lang=en">sued to have their union recognized in Romania</a> [case backgrounder ]. The couple is represented by Iustina Ionescu, long time board-member of the civil-rights organization ACCEPT. </p>

<p>International courts and lay-people have continued to hesitate to recognize and accept same-sex marriages. Earlier this month tens of thousands of people marched in Mexico to protest a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thousands-march-to-protest-same-sex-marriage-in-mexico.php">same-sex marriage recognition proposal</a> [JURIST report]. Last month the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/belize-top-court-strikes-down-anti-homosexuality-law.php">Belize Supreme Court struck down</a> [JURIST report] a law banning sodomy, declaring it unconstitutional and adversely impactful to the LGBT community. Last December <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/slovenia-voters-reject-same-sex-marriage-law.php">voters in Slovenia rejected a law</a> [JURIST report] that would allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. In November the <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-constitutional-court-grants-same-sex-couples-right-to-adopt.php">Constitutional Court of Colombia ruled</a> [JURIST report] that same-sex couples can legally adopt children. The UN has become increasingly focused on the rights of LGBT individuals. Last September 12 <a href="/paperchase/2015/09/un-agencies-urge-states-to-protect-rights-of-lgbti-individuals.php">UN agencies released a joint statement</a> [JURIST report] arguing that abuses toward the LGBT population are human rights abuses impacting society as a whole. In June 2015 the UN Office of the <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/un-rights-office-reports-continued-lgbt-discrimination.php">High Commissioner for Human Rights reported</a> [JURIST report] that members of the LGBT community continue to face discrimination and human rights abuses. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kenyan representatives said Monday in a preliminary hearing that the <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php?lang=en">International Court of Justice</a> (ICJ) [official website] has no part in their dispute with Somalia over borders. The dispute, <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=3&case=161">Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean)</a> [case materials], centers around the boundary between the two countries and under which sovereignty oil deposits in the Indian Ocean fall. Githu Muigai, the lawyer for Kenya, said during objections at the beginning of the preliminary hearing that the ICJ does not have proper jurisdiction over the dispute as there are <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/161/19088.pdf">other methods through which the boundary could be determined</a> [transcript, PDF]. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/161/18362.pdf">Somalia v. Kenya</a> [official application] was filed with the ICJ in 2014, after negotiations between the two countries concerning the boundary fell through. Somalia filed their <a href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/161/18360.pdf">complaint</a> [press release, PDF], putting this question to the ICJ: "to determine, on the basis of international law, the complete course of the single maritime boundary dividing all the maritime areas appertaining to Somalia and to Kenya in the Indian Ocean, including the continental shelf beyond 200 [nautical miles]."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN representatives <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20525&LangID=E">stated</a> [press release] Monday that the organization needs access to Syrian refugees in order to better document war crimes. The remarks were made during an interactive dialogue between the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/HRC/Pages/redirect.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> and the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx">Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic</a> [official websites]. Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry, noted that it has become difficult to access witnesses and victims with fresh information as Syrian refugees flee the region, but the recent <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/syria-ceasefire-agreement-takes-effect.php">cessation of hostilities</a> [JURIST report] has created a "glimmer of hope." "We are appealing to countries inside Europe hosting newly arrived Syrian refugees to grant us access and remove any barriers to our work," Pinheiro stated. The inquiry panel also urged major world powers to refer Syria to the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> [official website].</p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war surrounding the legitimacy of Assad. Last week Russian officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/russia-us-air-strikes-that-killed-syria-forces-could-threaten-ceasefire-agreement.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that a US-led airstrike which killed Syrian troops could threaten the ceasefire agreed upon between Syrian and opposition forces. In August a top UN official submitted a report detailing an in-depth investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-syria-wracked-by-chemical-warfare.php">chemical warfare</a> [JURIST report] used by Islamic State and Assad in Syria. That same month Amnesty International said that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could amount to a <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-syria-chlorine-gas-attack-could-be-war-crime.php">war crime</a> [JURIST report]. In July Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. In June UN human rights experts called for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">immediate protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik stated to the press on Monday that there will be referendum for Bosnian Serbs regarding a disputed holiday in their autonomous region. The referendum will <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/bosnia-serb-dodik-vows-proceed-with-referendum/28000869.html">take place</a> [RFE/FL report] on September 25 and will ask residents of the Srpska region if the mini-state's statehood day should remain on January 9. This vote defies a ruling by the <a href="http://www.ccbh.ba/?lang=enhttp://www.ccbh.ba/?lang=en">Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitutional Court</a> [official website] upholding a previous decision that the referendum is banned for being discriminatory, since the date falls on a Serb Orthodox Christian holiday. The <a href="http://www.narodnaskupstinars.net/?q=en">National Assembly of the Republic of Srpska</a> [official website] previously voted in July to <a href="http://www.narodnaskupstinars.net/?q=la/vijesti/19-posebna-sjednica-narodne-skup%C5%A1tine-usvojena-odluka-o-raspisivanju-referenduma-o-danu-republike">hold the referendum</a> [press release, in Serbian; JURIST <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/republic-of-srpska-assembly-sets-date-for-referendum-on-statehood-day.php">report</a>] within its territory on September 25.</p>

<p>Tensions between the ethnic Bosnian and Serbian populations of the former Yugoslavian states continue to be emotionally charged, years after the Balkan war. The <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [JURIST backgrounder] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the conflict. In March the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/icty-acquits-serbian-nationalist-seselj-of-all-balkan-war-crimes.php#">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Vojislav Šešelj, president of the Serbian Radical Party and former Assembly member of Serbia, of all crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the Balkan war. In May 2015 the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/icty-orders-serbia-to-return-seselj-to-detention.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Serbia's justice ministry to <a href="/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">return Šešelj to his detention cell immediately</a> [JURIST op-ed] after he was released in February to return to Serbia for cancer treatment. The ICTY had <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icty-orders-serbian-nationalist-seselj-to-return-to-court.php">revoked his provisional release</a> [JURIST report] in March 2015 because Šešelj spoke at a news conference in Belgrade and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-serb-nationalist-vojislav-seselj-back-to-detention-1427715609">stated</a> [WSJ report] that he would not return voluntarily to The Hague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php">Governor Jerry Brown</a> [official website] on Monday signed <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1383">Senate Bill 1383</a> [legislative materials], which sets new state goals for cutting pollutants like methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot, also referred to as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-updates-vowing-to-protect-the-lungs-of-1474312163-htmlstory.html">black carbons</a> [LAT report]. While comparing the fight against climate change to Noah's ark, Brown said that reducing this "short lived" climate pollution will help the battle. The purpose of SB 1383 is "to achieve a reduction in methane by 40%, hydrofluorocarbon gases by 40%, and anthropogenic black carbon by 50% below 2013 levels by 2030."</p>

<p>This is only the most recent in a series of bills related to climate change signed by Governor Brown. Earlier this month Brown <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/california-governor-signs-emissions-reduction-bill-into-law.php">signed into law</a> [JURIST report] two bills that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030. At least since 1992, with the UN Conference on Environment and Development, <a href="/feature/2014/11/climate-change-international-treaties.php">treaties</a> [JURIST backgrounder] on climate change have bolstered multi-national commitment to combating climate change. On the state level, California has finalized many pieces of legislation seeking to reduce greenhouse gasses and other alleged contributors to climate change for the last decade or more. The state introduced the Clean Car Law in 2002 and the Global Warming Solutions Act in 2006. In the past year, Brown has traveled to the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19390">UN headquarters in New York</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19236">UN Climate Change Conference in Paris</a>, the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19048">Vatican in Italy</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19027">Climate Summit of the Americas in Toronto, Canada</a> [press releases] to urge other leaders to fight against climate change with the same intensity as California.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/home">US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit</a> [official website] on Monday <a href="http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/Opinions/Published/151591.P.pdf">ruled</a> [text, PDF] that Rowan County Commissioners in North Carolina may open public meetings with prayer. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) and <a href="http://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/">ACLU of North Carolina</a> [advocacy websites] brought the suit in 2013 on behalf of three Rowan County residents who were alleging that the opening prayers violated their First Amendment rights. The focus of the lawsuit is the opening prayer at almost all meetings, which is focused only on Christianity. In a press release on Monday, the ACLU <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/appeals-court-panel-reverses-ruling-found-rowan-county-prayer-policy-unconstitutional">stated</a> [press release]:<blockquote>In Rowan County, the officials themselves deliver the prayers, meaning people of different beliefs have no opportunity to do so, and the commissioners instruct those present to stand and join in the prayer, leading many residents to feel coerced and pressured into doing so.</blockquote>The ACLU argued that the Rowan County Commissioners' practices violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and the federal district court in 2015 agreed. However, Monday's Fourth Circuit opinion rejected that arguing, stating that the practices are constitutional and supported by previous case law.</p>

<p>The US <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/supreme-court-rules-prayer-allowed-at-town-meetings.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2014 <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/town-of-greece-v-galloway/">Town of Greece v. Galloway</a> [SCOTUSblog backgrounder] that the practice of opening town meetings with a prayer does not violate the <a href="/feature/featured/the-establishment-clause/">Establishment Clause</a> [JURIST backgrounder] of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment">First Amendment</a> [text]. The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/second-circuit-rules-against-town-council-led-prayer.php#.U2et0Cgxp48">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in 2012 that the New York town's practice amounted to an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion. In an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court reversed that ruling, finding a "permissible ceremonial purpose."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabon's <a href="http://www.gabonembassyusa.org/ambassador">Ambassador to the US</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/opinion/presidential-elections-in-gabon.html?_r=1">said</a> [NYT op-ed] Monday that ballots from the contested presidential election will be recounted in the coming days. The election results sparked days of protests and outrage when it was announced that incumbent <a href="http://presidence-gabon.ga">President Ali Bongo Ondimba</a> [official website, in French] won by less than 10,000 votes. The ambassador stressed that election was held in compliance with international law. He further claimed that representatives of the candidates also assisted with the initial counting of the ballots. However to ensure continued transparency of the electoral process, the ballots will be recounted:<blockquote>Gabon invited more than 1,200 international observers from the European Union, the African Union, N.D.I. and other election experts to observe this process. All said, the election was free, fair, and transparent. The State Department and the African Union stated that any challenge to the election results conform to Gabonese election law. The Constitutional Court's review will also conform to the law. A recount of the vote will be completed by the Constitutional Court and the winner confirmed.</blockquote>The announcement comes after the contested election has continued to generate criticism and backlash. Jean Ping, an opposition leader in Gabon, had filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court in a move challenging the validity of the recent <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/gabon-opposition-candidate-challenges-validity-of-election.php">presidential vote</a> [JURIST report]. A report released last week by Amnesty International condemned Gabon <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/amnesty-gabon-security-forces-using-excessive-force-against-protesters-after-election.php">security forces</a> [JURIST report] for using excessive force against protesters after the country's disputed election. Amid recent protests and outbreaks of violence, Gabon's Justice Minister Seraphim Moundounga <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/gabon-justice-minister-resigns-amid-presidential-election-protests.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] rom his post earlier in September.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Serbian paramilitary commander Dragan Vasiljkovic went on trial for war crimes Tuesday in Croatia's <a href="http://www.sudacka-mreza.hr/sudovi.aspx?Search=&ShowID=dir94&Lng=en">Split Court</a> [official website]. Dragan is <a href="http://hr.n1info.com/a150596/Vijesti/Sudjenje-Draganu-Vasiljkovicu.html">accused</a> [N1 report, in Croatian] of torturing and murdering civilians and prisoners during the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/croatia.htm">Croation War for independence</a> [GlobalSecurity backgrounder]. Some of the crimes of which he is accused include crimes of aggression that resulted in the destruction of civilian homes, the deaths of a reporter and the murder of prisoners. He has staunchly denied the accusations, claiming he was a defender of his homeland.</p>

<p>In July the 61-year-old <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/serbian-paramilitary-commander-formally-pleads-guilty-to-war-crimes.php">pleaded not guilty</a> [JURIST report] to the charges of "war crimes" brought against him. Vasiljkovic was first arrested in Australia in 2006, following an extradition request from the Croatian government. Vasiljkovic had challenged extradition at least 13 times, but in 2012 the Australian Minister for Justice formally approved Vasiljkovic's <a href="/paperchase/2012/11/australia-approves-extradition-of-alleged-serbian-war-criminal.php">extradition to Croatia</a> [JURIST report]. The Serbian commander was officially <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/former-serbian-commander-indicted-for-war-crimes-in-croatia.php">indicted</a> [JURIST report] for war crimes in January of this year.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thailand's Bangkok South Criminal Court <a href="http://www.finnwatch.org/en/news/408-andy-hall-found-guilty-in-a-shock-ruling-by-bangkok-court">found</a> [Finnwatch report] British labor rights activist Andy Hall guilty of criminal defamation and violating cyber crime laws on Tuesday. The charges came about after Hall published <a href="http://www.finnwatch.org/images/cheap%20has%20a%20high%20price_exec%20summary_final.pdf">Cheap Has a High Price</a> [report, PDF], a report on labor abuse in the fruit canning sector. The 2013 report focused on a <a href="http://www.naturalfruit.co.th/">Natural Fruit Company Ltd.</a> [corporate website] factory and alleged poor working conditions, low wages and instances of child labor. Natural Fruit, which is a major supplier to the western world, denied the allegations made in Hall's report and brought criminal charges against him. The court held that Hall had violated the <a href="https://www.samuiforsale.com/law-texts/computer-crime-act.html">Computer Crimes Act</a> [unofficial translation] and issued a three-year suspended jail sentence. Sonja Vartiala, Executive Director of Finnwatch stated her opinion on the ruling:<blockquote>Thailand's laws that allow for criminal punishment and even imprisonment for defamation are in clear breach of Thailand's international human rights obligations. Instead of allowing companies to take human rights defenders to criminal courts for alleged defamation, Thailand needs to thoroughly follow through on allegations of violations of migrant workers' rights.</blockquote>Hall will appeal the sentence.</p>

<p>Thailand has been home to significant human rights concerns for years, some of which stem from the nation's court system. In particular, human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand since the military junta came to power in May 2014. Also in September the Thailand Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailands-top-court-sentences-protest-leader-to-20-years.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 20-year prison sentence given to protest leader Sondhi Limthongkul in 2012. Thai military officials in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/three-human-rights-defenders-charged-in-thailand-over-report-on-torture.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] three human rights defenders with criminal defamation and violations of the Computer Crimes Act because of a report they published detailing acts of torture in Thailand. In April Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/thailand-urged-to-revoke-military-police-powers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to stop harassing and charging human right lawyers for defending victims of the government's abuses, and to revoke military police powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/UNIIB/Pages/UNIIB.aspx">Independent Investigation in Burundi</a> (UNIIB) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20534&LangID=E">stated</a> [press release] their grave concern about the current human rights situation in Burundi. The group found, "abundant evidence of gross human rights violations," which they believe could amount to crimes against humanity by the government of Burundi and people associated with it. Among the calls for international action, the UNIIB called for the immediate creation of an international Commission of Inquiry into the situation. The UNIIB stated that  if the violations continue and the Government continues to fail to prevent abuses, invocation of Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which authorizes the UN to deploy a force to restore international peace may be necessary. </p>

<p>Violence in Burundi began in the wake of President Pierre Nkurunziza's announcement that he would seek a third term of office, to which he was <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/president-of-burundi-reelected-despite-constitutional-limits.php">elected</a> [JURIST report] last year. Last month UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed concern over increased violence and rights violations in Burundi and <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/un-calls-for-inclusive-political-dialogue-to-end-burundi-crisis.php">called for an "inclusive political dialogue"</a> [JURIST report] to end the ongoing struggle. Speaking to the council about his trip to Burundi last month, the secretary-general stated, "I cannot stress enough the profound humanitarian consequences that political unrest, violence and impunity carry for the population." Last November the UN Security Council <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/un-adopts-resolution-to-work-to-end-violence-in-burundi.php">unanimously adopted</a> [JURIST report] a resolution condemning the political violence and killings currently afflicting Burundi.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] opened an investigation on Tuesday into the fatal police shooting of Terence Crutcher. Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-probes-police-shooting-of-unarmed-black-man-in-tulsa-1474393482">shot last week</a> [WSJ report] by a Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer responding to a 911 call of a vehicle blocking a road. The Tulsa police department is investigating the shooting, but US Attorney <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndok/meet-us-attorney">Danny Williams</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/state-and-federal-agencies-investigating-tpds-use-of-deadly-force">announced</a> [KJRH report] to the press that the DOJ's investigation will focus specifically on whether a civil rights violation occurred. A <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/19/police-involved-shooting-black-man-tulsa-prompts-investigation/90716058/">video</a> [AP report] of the circumstances surrounding the shooting was released earlier this week, but the actual moment of the shots being fired was blocked from view. The last images of Crutcher before the shooting showed him walking to his car with his hands up and then placing his hands on the top of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The situation has occurred amid a national conversation about police use of force, particularly against black citizens, and subsequent retaliation. In a press conference held in July in Washington, DC, Attorney General Loretta Lynch gave her response to the shooting of police in Dallas during a peaceful protest. Lynch <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/loretta-lynch-condemns-shooting-of-dallas-police.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that the DOJ, including the FBI, ATF, and US Marshals Service and US Attorneys Office were conducting an investigation into the Dallas shooting. In May Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law an <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">amended hate crimes bill</a> [JURIST report], referred to as the "Blue Lives Matter" law, including police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected. The bill has drawn the contempt of some civil rights groups, including the "Black Lives Matter" movement. Earlier this year the DOJ <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/san-francisco-police-under-doj-review.php">launched an investigation</a> [JURIST report] of the San Francisco Police Department following the shooting of an unarmed African American. In December an Ohio grand jury <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/ohio-grand-jury-declines-to-indict-in-police-shooting.php">decided not to indict</a> [JURIST report] two officers involved in a 2014 shooting resulting in the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Earlier that month the DOJ announced that it would be <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/doj-to-open-investigation-into-chicago-police-department-after-shooting.php">opening a full investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the Chicago Police Department following the 2014 police shooting death of a black teenager.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.nccourts.org/courts/appellate/appeal/">North Carolina Court of Appeals</a> [official website] <a href="https://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=2&pdf=34253">affirmed</a> [opinion, PDF] a lower court's dismissal of a claim by two former magistrates that their rights were violated by 2014 guidance memos from the <a href="http://www.nccourts.org/courts/crs/aocadmin/default.asp">Administrative Office of the Courts</a> (AOC) [official website] that said they could be fired if they refused to perform same-sex marriages. The magistrates resigned after the guidance was issued and filed this suit in April 2015. The magistrates sought a religious accommodation so that they would not be forced to violate their religious beliefs by performing same-sex marriages. The suit was filed against the North Carolina AOC and its interim director, but the court dismissed the claim for lack of standing because the AOC has no statutory authority to "appoint, sanction, suspend, remove, or generally supervise magistrates."  </p>

<p>Similar disagreement occurred among officials in the Alabama court system regarding same-sex marriage. In March the Alabama Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/alabama-supreme-court-dismisses-petitions-against-same-sex-marriage.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] petitions that sought a ruling declaring the state's prohibition on same-sex marriage valid despite the US Supreme Court's June ruling declaring same-sex marriage legal. In January Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore instructed state judges <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/alabama-chief-justice-halts-same-sex-marriage-licenses.php">not to issue</a> [JURIST report] same-sex marriage licenses. The Alabama Supreme Court had ruled in March 2015 that the state's ban on same-sex marriage is legal and Moore's order stated that ruling remained in effect despite the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-same-sex-marriage-bans.php">finding</a> [JURIST report] such bans unconstitutional. Moore's order had caused confusion among probate judges, with some defying the order and issuing <a href="/feature/featured/same-sex-marriage/">same-sex marriage</a> [JURIST backgrounder] licenses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/node">US District Court for the Southern District of Texas</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzgzy2KXyxqtM3Q3WnN0UjNseUk/view">ruled</a> [order, PDF] in favor of the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] in a case asserting that the state of Texas failed to soften its voter identification law <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/judge-approves-texas-voter-id-agreement">as ordered</a> [TPM report]. After the <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> [official website] in July <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/14/14-41127-CV3.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that Texas' voter ID law was too stringent, the state and the DOJ reached an agreement to soften the law. Now, voters lacking the required ID may sign an affidavit promising that they had a "reasonable impediment" to bringing it, on the condition that they provide another form of ID. Contradicting this agreement, the state was telling voters that they could use the affidavit alternative only if they "have not obtained" and "cannot obtain" a required ID, language that Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos ruled was more harsh than the reasonable impediment language agreed upon. To remedy the situation Ramos ordered the state to re-issue all of its pre-election brochures and propaganda to incorporate the agreed-upon language. </p>

<p>The right to vote has become especially contentious as the presidential election approaches. Earlier this month the Missouri legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/missouri-legislature-overrides-veto-on-voter-id-and-gun-laws.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] vetoes by Governor Jay Nixon to approve two bills, one requiring voter ID and the other removing the need to renew permits in order to carry a concealed weapon. Last month an Oklahoma court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial voter ID law allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. In July voter restrictions were overturned in <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> [official website] on Tuesday <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/09/20/15-35738.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] that children facing deportation proceedings may not file a class action suit to determine whether they are entitled to an attorney as a due process right. The opinion reversed in part a ruling by Judge Thomas Zilly that <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/jefm-v-lynch">determined</a> [ACLU report] the federal courts had jurisdiction to hear the class action lawsuit on constitutional grounds. The three-judge panel ruled instead that the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/laws/immigration-and-nationality-act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a> [text] exclusive review process applied, necessitating that each individual plaintiff file an appeal in the federal court after all deportation proceedings were exhausted. Interest groups vying on behalf of those facing deportation said it is unreasonable to expect children to navigate the courts to avoid deportation, and the court commiserated. Judge Mary Margaret McKeown wrote in her concurrence to a unanimous decision that it is within the purview of the legislature and executive branches to extend to potential deportees the right to counsel, but she opined that little is likely to be done because the issue lacks "[m]oney and resolve." </p>

<p>Immigrants' rights and abilities to participate in American governance and judicial proceedings have been hotly contested recently. In July a Kansas judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the state must count thousands of votes from people who registered without providing citizenship documents. In April Assistant Professor Michael Morley at Barry University School of Law <a href="/forum/2016/04/michael-morley-unanswered-evenwel.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] a Supreme Court ruling that dealt with voting rights and illegal immigration. Last November New Jersey lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/new-jersey-lawmakers-advance-immigrant-drivers-license-bill.php">advanced a bill</a> [JURIST report] that allowed undocumented immigrants to obtain New Jersey driver's licenses. Last January the US House of Representatives <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/us-house-votes-to-block-funding-for-obamas-action-on-immigration.php">passed</a> [JURIST report] a $40 billion funding bill for the Department of homeland Security that included amendments to repeal two key facets to President Barack Obama's immigration action. In 2014 Obama <a href="/paperchase/2014/11/obama-announces-immigration-reforms.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] executive actions on immigration that would allow 4.7 million undocumented immigrants to stay in the US.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/">US Chamber of Commerce</a> [website], representing 50 business organizations, is also <a href="http://www.chamberlitigation.com/content/plano-chamber-commerce-texas-association-business-us-chamber-commerce-et-al-v-us-department">suing the DOL</a> [materials] over the same regulation. The "new Overtime Rule," as it is referred to by challengers, was promulgated by the DOL and its Wage and Hour Division to update salary and compensation standards as well as to provide guidelines for determining who qualifies for exemption from from the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf">Fair Labor Standards Act</a> [text, PDF] minimum wage and overtime pay protections. The regulation raises the bar for exemption by doubling the baseline salary requirement and implementing a "duties test." The challengers assert that the regulation did not complete the rule-making process, violates federalism in regards to wage-making provisions, and bypasses Congressional authorization. The states argue that the rule will be unduly difficult to abide by as it updates standards every three years. The states also allege that compliance will result at high costs to employers, and may lead to less hours or opportunities for employment. </p>

<p>In June the US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-orders-new-look-at-overtime-case.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/encino-motorcars-llc-v-navarro/">Encino Motorcars v. Navarro</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that it could not rely on the DOL's interpretation of a statute on overtime pay, sending the case back to the lower court. In May the White House <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-extends-overtime-pay-to-42-million-salaried-workers-2016-5">announced</a> [Business Insider report] that the DOL would raise the salary threshold for overtime pay to $47,476 a year or $913 a week. The change has widespread <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2016/05/04/overtime-rule-changes-are-coming-is-your-business-ready/#44863aa35f56">implications</a> [Forbes report] for businesses and nonprofits that must either raise wages for employees or pay overtime compensation. The Obama administration has maintained that the new rule will improve the lives of workers while businesses and Republicans have <a href="https://www.shrm.org/legalissues/federalresources/pages/overtime-rule-bill-introduced.aspx">criticized</a> [SHRM report] the rule stating that it will "hurt the lowest paid American workers the most."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/us/ahmad-khan-rahami/index.html">Ahmad Rahami</a> [CNN profile], the suspect in last week's <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/19/timeline-new-york-new-jersey-bombings/90685308/">bombings in New York and New Jersey</a> [USA Today timeline], was <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/southern-district-of-new-york-criminal-complaint-against-ahmad-rahami-1.12347292">charged</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] Tuesday. The charges include: Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Bombing a Place of Public Use, Destruction of Property by Means of Fire or Explosive, and Use of a Destructive Device During and in Furtherance of a Crime of Violence. Rahami is also facing <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/u-s-district-court-of-new-jersey-complaint-against-ahmad-rahami-1.12347322">similar charges</a> [complaint, PDF] in the <a href="http://www.njd.uscourts.gov/">US District Court for the District of New Jersey</a> [official website]. The bombings, which took place on Saturday, injured 29 people in New York, and no one was injured in the New Jersey attack.

The suspect also faces charges of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/19/us/new-york-explosion-investigation/">attempted murder of a law enforcement officer</a> [CNN report] stemming from the shootout. </p>

<p>A bomb went off in Seaside Park, New Jersey, on Saturday morning. The location was serving as the venue for a Marine Corps charity race. That evening an explosion occurred in Chelsea, injuring 29 people. Numerous explosive devices were uncovered in the city throughout the weekend. Ahmad Rahami was identified as the suspect behind the bombings from surveillance video and fingerprinting. Rahami's father <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/nyregion/ahmad-khan-rahami-suspect.html?_r=0">reported him in 2014</a> [NYT report] as a suspected terrorist. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A commission under the <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/home">Council of Europe</a> [official website] on Wednesday released a <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-PI(2016)010-e">preliminary report</a> [text, PDF] finding that proposed changes to the Azerbaijan Constitution are not justified and would hinder the <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/european-human-rights-group-warns-on-azerbaijan-constitution/">balance of government power</a> [AP report]. The <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/events/">Venice Commission</a> [official website], a constitutional watchdog branch of the Council of Europe, wrote the report and focused their warning on proposed changes to the <a href="http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/events/?id=2302">powers of the president</a> [press release]. Proposed changes include increasing presidential terms from five to seven years, allowing the president to appoint a vice president and permitting the president to set dates for early elections. According to the Venice Commission, these modifications are "unprecedented in comparative perspective and have no justification in the context of Azerbaijan." The proposals also include many human rights provisions of the Constitution. While some raise concerns due to limiting certain freedoms, the Venice Commission acknowledges that some of the human rights proposals are "generally positive." A referendum on the modifications will be held Monday.</p>

<p>The human rights situation in Azerbaijan has drawn heavy criticism from the UN and various rights groups the past few years. In April Azerbaijan <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/azerbaijan-announces-ceasefire-with-armenia-over-disputed-land.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] a "unilateral ceasefire" to the fighting with Armenian forces over the disputed area of Nagorno-Karabakh. In March Azeri human rights lawyer and advocate <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=Intigam+Aliyev&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Intigam Aliyev</a> [JURIST news archive] was <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/azerbaijan-releases-human-rights-activist-from-jail.php">freed from jail</a> [JURIST report] after the US State Department <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/us-department-of-state-condemns-azerbaijan-for-human-rights-lawyer-imprisonment.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] the imprisonment and called for his release almost a year before. In April 2015 Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/hrw-calls-for-release-of-azerbaijan-human-rights-activist.php">reported the conviction</a> [JURIST report] of leading human rights activist Rasul Jafarov and called for his immediate release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A senior UN official on Tuesday unveiled a draft set of principles aimed at continuing momentum toward the protection of <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54978#.V-LDCvArLb0">human rights of refugees and migrants</a> [UN News Centre report]. The momentum began with UN member states' adoption of the <a href="http://www.un.org/pga/70/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/08/HLM-on-addressing-large-movements-of-refugees-and-migrants-Draft-Declaration-5-August-2016.pdf">New York Declaration</a> [text, PDF; UN <a href="http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/declaration">summary</a>] earlier this week. <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/KateGilmore.aspx">Kate Gilmore</a> [official profile], the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, talked about the necessity of making human rights, and how they are implemented, a consistent focus in discussions about migration movements:<blockquote>Specifically, the 20 draft principles focus on human rights; non-discrimination; rescue and assistance; access to justice; border governance; returns; violence; detention; family unity; child migrants; women migrants; right to health; adequate standard of living; decent work; right to education; right to information; monitoring and accountability; migrants' human rights defenders; data; and international cooperation.</blockquote>Between these guiding principles and the New York Declaration, one goal is to eventually establish a plan for safe migration in 2018.</p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. Ahead of the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants this week, UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-protect-women-and-girls-in-migration.php">experts urged</a> [JURIST report] states to protect women and girls in the movement of refugees and migrants by adhering to international human rights conventions and standards. Last week <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy websites] said that the draft of the final outcome document for the UN summit on refugees fell short of dealing with the issue <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/rights-groups-un-summit-falling-short-on-refugee-issues.php">effectively</a> [JURIST report]. According to the rights groups, the UN is missing an opportunity by not proposing anything of substance. Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/austria-threatens-lawsuit-against-hungary-over-migrant-acceptance.php">said</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that Austria will take Hungary to the International Court of Justice if Hungary does not begin accepting returning migrants that crossed into Austria from Hungary. Last month the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-bulgaria-arresting-migrants-cause-for-concern.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over Bulgaria's criminalization of migrants leaving and entering the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30d58b9e0d8f99ac41dd8793b43cc7d11f3a.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxyKa3b0?text=&docid=183607&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=860365">ruled</a> [judgment] Wednesday that a power plant in Wales has violated the EU's limit on nitrogen oxide emissions. The <a href="http://www.rwe.com/web/cms/en/97594/rwe-npower/about-us/our-businesses/power-generation/aberthaw/">Aberthaw plant</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-court-emissions-idUSKCN11R13H">operated</a> [Reuters report] for 45 years and primarily uses Welsh coal as its fuel source. In 2008 the EU forced member states to reduce their emissions to meet new environmental standards. Though Britain argued that the plant's use of Welsh coal should allow for a greater emissions limit, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/index_en.htm">European Commission</a> [official website] nevertheless brought Britain to court in March 2015. Due to the EU court's ruling, Britain will be required to reduce the plant's emissions and pay all imposed fines and legal costs. German utility company <a href="https://www.rwe.com/web/cms/en/8/rwe/">RWE</a> [corporate website], operator of the plant, expressed disappointment in the ruling and declared its intention to continue improving the plant's environmental status into the next decade. The Welsh government also stated it will continue to address the area's air quality. </p>

<p>Environmental destruction has been an issue plaguing much of the world, including the US. Last week a policy paper was published detailing how the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] will work to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/icc-to-focus-on-environmental-crimes.php">prosecute environmental crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this month environmentalists <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/environmentalists-sue-epa-over-water-quality-standards.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the US Environmental Protection Agency regarding federal water quality standards. In March Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was served with a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the water contamination in Flint, Michigan. In February BP supervisors were <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bp-supervisor-found-not-guilty-of-clean-water-act-violation.php">found not guilty</a> [JURIST report] of a Clean Water Act violation after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) [official website] on Wednesday filed a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2016/comp-pr2016-189.pdf">civil suit</a> [complaint, PDF] in federal district court against <a href="http://www.forbes.com/profile/leon-g-cooperman/">Leon Cooperman</a> [Forbes backgrounder], billionaire and head of major hedge fund firm <a href="https://www.omega-advisors.com/">Omega Advisors</a> [corporate website]. Cooperman is a major shareholder in <a href="https://partnerdatalink.com/Atlas/Login/Logon.aspx">Atlas Pipeline Partners</a> [corporate website] and was allegedly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/business/dealbook/leon-cooperman-insider-trading.html">informed</a> [NYT report] in 2010 that the company was selling off one of its operating facilities. According to SEC regulators, Cooperman took advantage of this insider information and garnered USD $4 million when Atlas' stock rose following the sale. Regulators have also found that Cooperman shared this insider information with other relatives invested in the company, one of which may have made the initial report against Cooperman. While the definition of insider trading has recently been narrowed to those that seek personal benefit, regulators believe that Cooperman may still be charged since he misappropriated confidential information. Cooperman has denied all allegations and has stressed his determination to fight the charges and preserve his legacy.</p>

<p>Insider trading is an international concern among securities regulators. In November New York a district judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/federal-judge-orders-congress-to-cooperate-with-insider-trading-probe.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] a US House of Representatives committee and a former staffer to cooperate with an insider trading investigation into a health care policy leak. Last October the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/supreme-court-declines-request-to-review-insider-trading-case.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] an appeal in the case of two former hedge fund traders whose insider trading convictions were overturned by a lower court in December. In July 2015 the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/pennsylvania-federal-court-issues-indictment-for-insider-trading.php">issued an indictment</a> [JURIST report] against real estate agent Herbert Sudfeld for alleged insider trading, with charges including securities fraud, three counts of making false statements to the FBI, and aiding and abetting. In April of last year the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-declines-rajat-guptas-insider-trading-appeal.php">denied <em>certiorari</em></a> [JURIST report] in an appeal brought by Rajat Gupta, the former director of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., for his 2012 insider trading conviction. In January 2015 the Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/supreme-court-rejects-appeal-by-ex-goldman-sachs-director.php">rejected another appeal</a> [JURIST report] by Gupta, leaving in place a lifetime ban on serving as an officer or director of a public company that stems from the civil case against him by the SEC.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Germany court: Volkswagen facing over $8 billion in claims</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A German court <a href="http://www.landgericht-braunschweig.niedersachsen.de/aktuelles/presseinformationen/1400-schadensersatzklagen-von-anlegern-gegen-die-volkswagen-ag-beim-landgericht-braunschweig-147085.html">said</a> [press release, in German] Wednesday that <a href="http://www.vw.com/">Volkswagen</a> (VW) [corporate website] faces over USD $8.2 billion in damage claims from investors over its emissions scandal. Roughly 1,400 lawsuits have been <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/21/volkswagen-emissions-lawsuits/">filed</a> [Fortune report] at the Braunschweig court near VW's Wolfsburg headquarters. Plaintiffs <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-08-08/investor-suits-against-volkswagen-move-ahead-in-germany">allege</a> [AP report] that VW did not inform shareholders quickly enough of the impending scandal. The biggest single claim was filed for over €3.3 billion on behalf of institutional investors. The court is still processing claims as many plaintiffs rushed to file before the one-year anniversary of the scandal on September 18. VW may need to set aside more than the USD $18 billion that they already designated to cover the cost of vehicle refits and a settlement with US authorities.</p>

<p>VW is facing legal difficulty around the world over the emissions scandal. Earlier this month the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/australia-suing-volkswagen-for-misleading-customers.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] VW and its local subsidiary for misleading customers. In August a district court in Germany <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/germany-court-lawsuits-against-volkswagen-may-proceed.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that a collective complaint against VW may move forward. Like US-style class-action lawsuits, the collective complaint was launched on behalf of multiple investors who lost money following the diesel emissions cheating scandal. In July a judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of California <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-gives-preliminary-approval-to-volkswagen-settlement.php">gave preliminary approval</a> [JURIST report] to a $15 billion settlement between VW and the US Environmental Protection Agency, California officials and consumers. In June VW <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/volkswagen-settles-over-allegations-of-cheating-emissions-tests-and-deceiving-customers.php">agreed</a> [JURIST report] to spend up to $14.7 billion to settle allegations of cheating emissions tests and deceiving customers in a settlement with US regulators. In March the US Federal Trade Commission <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/ftc-sues-volkswagon-for-false-advertising.php">filed suit</a> [JURIST report] against VW for false advertising.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Brazilian judge on Tuesday accepted charges against former president <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-10841416">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> [BBC profile] after the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/business/international/effects-of-petrobras-scandal-leave-brazilians-lamenting-a-lost-dream.html">Petrobas Oil Scandal</a> [NYT report]. Judge Sergio Moro allowed charges that include complaints that da Silva illegally received almost USD $1.1 million in improvements and expenses from a construction company for a beachfront apartment. In return, it is reported, da Silva secured lucrative contracts from Petrobas for the construction company. Corruption charges were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/world/americas/ex-president-of-brazil-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-faces-charges.html">filed</a> [NYT report] against da Silva in March when prosecutors accused him of attempting to hide the property. Da Silva has also been charged for obstructing the investigation of the graft scheme around Petrobas.</p>

<p>More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal, including the chief of staff under Brazil's former President Jose Dirceu and the former president Fernando Collor de Mellon. Last November Brazil's highest court <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/brazil-arrests-politician-and-investment-banker-in-corruption-investigation.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the arrest of André Esteves, the chief executive of the country's largest investment bank, and that of Delcídio do Amaral, a powerful senator of the country's ruling party, both accused of bribery and corruption affiliated with Petrobras.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and hazardous substances and wastes <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/ToxicWastes/Pages/BaskutTuncak.aspx">Baskut Tuncak</a> [official profile] on Wednesday <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20546&LangID=E">urged</a> [press release] the international community to help end the "silent pandemic" of childhood disease and disability..." caused by exposure to toxins and waste. Stating that children were the "most vulnerable to toxics and pollution," and that they are "impacted in ways in which adults [are] not," Tuncak said that states and businesses had an "obligation" to protect children from these hazardous substances. He then cited examples of children being exposed to hazardous waste from the <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/6-michigan-employees-indicted-in-flint-water-crisis.php">water crisis in Flint, Michigan</a> [JURIST report], to deaths in South Korea resulting from untested products.</p>

<p>Exposure to hazardous substances has been an issue plaguing much of the world, including the US. Earlier this month environmentalists <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/environmentalists-sue-epa-over-water-quality-standards.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the US Environmental Protection Agency regarding federal water quality standards. In March Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan was served with a <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/parents-in-flint-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-michigan-governor-over-water-contamination.php">class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] over the water contamination in Flint, Michigan. In February BP supervisors were <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/bp-supervisor-found-not-guilty-of-clean-water-act-violation.php">found not guilty</a> [JURIST report] of a Clean Water Act violation after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Also in February the <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/us-supreme-court-delays-epas-clean-power-plan.php">Supreme Court blocked</a> [JURIST report] the EPA's Clean Power Plan, which meant to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In January a Hungarian court <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/hungary-court-acquits-15-employees-connected-to-2010-toxic-red-sludge-spill.php">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] 15 employees of the Mal Corp for their role in the toxic red sludge spill that killed 10 people in 2010 after a reservoir burst. Also in January Brazil's Federal Police <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/brazil-alleges-environmental-crimes-in-investigation-into-dam-collapse.php">accused seven people and three companies</a> [JURIST report] of environmental crimes in a probe into the major Fundão dam collapse that occurred on November 5.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Kashmir re-arrested a human rights advocate on Wednesday night under color of a controversial security law, the Public Safety Act, which allows the detention of suspects for up to six months without a trial. The arrest came almost <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/india-kashmiri-human-rights-activist-re-arrested">immediately after a court had ordered him released from police custody</a> [AI report]. Khurram Parvez had been in administrative detention since September 16 for allegedly posing an imminent threat of "breach of peace," and a court had ordered his release on Tuesday after ruling that the executive official who had ordered the detention had not followed necessary procedures, including failing to adequately explain the grounds for his detention. Amnesty International (AI) has called for his release and claims that "this kind of arbitrary use of the law suggests that the Jammu and Kashmir police are determined to lock up Khurram Parvez at any cost."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-16069078">Kashmir</a> [BBC backgrounder] has long been a subject of international concern. Last month the India branch of AI temporarily closed its office after the organization was <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-closes-india-office-after-accusations-of-sedition.php">accused of sedition and anti-India sentiments</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in August UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-urges-india-and-pakistan-to-grant-access-to-kashmir.php">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [JURIST report] expressed his <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20382&LangID=E">concerns</a> [press release] regarding Indian and Pakistani authorities refusing to allow the Human Rights Council access to Kashmir. In July <a href="http://mofa.gov.pk/content.php?pageID=adviser">Pakistani Adviser to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz</a> [official profile] announced his country's intention to ask the UN Human Rights Council to send a fact-finding mission to Kashmir following recent civil unrest in the disputed region. <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/pakistan-accuses-india-of-human-rights-violations-in-kashmir.php#">Pakistan accused</a> [JURIST report] India of human rights violations after a clash between the Indian army and pro-independence rebels, which led to the death of militant commander Burhan Wani of the group <a href="http://hizbmedia.org/Introduction.php">Hizbul Mujahideen</a> [official website]. Continued unrest following the clash preceded the use of force on which Pakistan now seeks Human Rights Council action.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Afghanistan government signed a peace agreement on Thursday with insurgent group Hezb-i Islami, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The US Embassy <a href="https://kabul.usembassy.gov/pr-092216.html">applauded</a> [press release] the peace accord as an important step towards ending violence and protecting constitutional rights in the country. The peace negotiations focused on Hezb-i Islami renouncing ties to extremist groups and acts of terrorism in exchange for immunity for acts committed during the war and the removal of Hekmatyar's name and that of his faction from terrorism blacklists. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/21/afghanistan-war-crimes-suspect-comes-home">denounced</a> [press release] the peace agreement as a failure by the Afghan government to pursue accountability for the many victims of actions taken by Hekmatyar in the 1990s. Afghanistan's chief executive Dr Abdullah Abdullah <a href="https://twitter.com/afgexecutive/status/778878004181295104?lang=en">expressed his hope</a> [Twitter statement] that the peace agreement with Hezb-i Islami would lead to a future peace with the Taliban.</p>

<p>The ongoing conflict in Afghanistan between the government and insurgent groups has created a dangerous environment for Afghan citizens and notably for women and children. In August HRW <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/hrw-afghanistan-forces-using-schools-as-military-bases.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] the government to take immediate steps to curtail the use of schools in military efforts. In July the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported that civilian casualties have <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/un-afghanistan-civilian-casualties-reach-record-high-in-first-half-of-year.php">reached a record high</a> [JURIST report] in the first half of 2016, with more than a third of that number accounting for children. In June three Taliban gunmen <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/taliban-gunmen-attack-afghanistan-court-building-killing-prosecutor.php">attacked</a> [JURIST report] a court building in eastern Afghanistan, killing seven people including a newly appointed chief prosecutor.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) [official website] Advocate General <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7026/fr/">Eleanor Sharpston</a> [official profile] released two opinions Thursday arguing that <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=183709&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=888451">Hamas</a> and the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=183682&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=888451">Tamil Tigers</a> [opinions] should be removed from the EU's <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/fight-against-terrorism/terrorist-list/">Terror List</a> [official website]. The opinions reason that because the organizations' governments followed the wrong procedures when including the two groups the court should reevaluate their place on the list. If the Advocate General's recommendation is heeded by the ECJ, the organizations will be removed from the Terror List and sanctions in relations to the list will be lifted. The groups' assets will cease to be frozen and the EU will cease to make extra efforts to stop any European funding from reaching them. EU officials would also be permitted to hold direct talks with senior members of either group. </p>

<p>Terror Lists have <a href="/paperchase/2008/01/europe-rights-watchdog-slams-eu-un.php">come under fire</a> in the last several years for <a href="/paperchase/2007/11/europe-rights-watchdog-says-eu-terror.php?edition=full">violating the basic human rights</a> [JURIST reports] of those affected by the blacklisting. This is the second time that the place of Hamas and the Tamil Tigers on the Terror List has been in dispute. In <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-court-strikes-down-inclusion-of-hamas-on-terror-list-1418808890">2014 the EU's second-highest court</a> [WSJ report] ruled that the groups' inclusion on the list had not followed official procedures and had been decided on "factual imputations derived from the press and the Internet."</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A policing unit in Afghanistan set up to investigate alleged war crimes committed by UK soldiers stationed in the war-torn country reportedly <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37441509">received</a> [BBC report] around 600 complaints of ill treatment and abuse occurring between 2005 and 2013. Members of the <a href="http://www.army.mod.uk/agc/provost/23207.aspx">Royal Military Police</a> [official website] are investigating the allegations, and UK Prime Minister Theresa May has <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/713223/Unit-investigates-Army-war-crimes-in-Afghanistan-receives-600-complaints">expressed her concern</a> [Daily Express report] that the allegations may be false claims against soldiers. A UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence">Ministry of Defence</a> [official website] spokesperson said that where there are credible complaints an investigation would be conducted. </p>

<p>War crime investigations of UK armed forces in the past had largely focused on actions in Iraq. In July the International Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/icc-will-not-prosecute-tony-blair-for-war-crimes-over-iraq-war.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] the decision not to prosecute Tony Blair for war crimes related to the 2003 Iraq War. In May the UK Supreme Court unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/uk-supreme-court-dismisses-iraq-civilians-claims-of-abuse-by-british-soldiers.php">rejected claims</a> [JURIST report] made by Iraqi civilians that they were extrajudicially detained and physically abused by British forces. In 2005 a prosecutor argued at the opening of a <a href="/paperchase/2005/09/british-court-martial-hears-of-killing.php">much-anticipated</a> [JURIST report] British court-martial that seven British paratroopers patrolling in southern Iraq in 2003 killed an Iraqi civilian and abused others after stopping a truck carrying them three weeks after hostilities had officially ended. This was the first trial of British soldiers for the killing of an Iraqi civilian.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Ukraine's high court on Tuesday <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/20160921/1045540454/ukraine-russia-gazprom-court.html">dismissed</a> [Sputnik International report] an <correction num=1>appeal</correction> by <a href="http://www.gazprom.com/">Gazprom</a> [corporate website] finding it "groundless." The court decided to <a href="http://uatoday.tv/business/ukraine-supreme-court-rejects-gazprom-s-appeal-against-usd-3-4-bln-monopoly-fine-751038.html">uphold</a> [Ukraine Today report] the USD $3.4 billion fine against the company handed down by Ukraine's Anti-Monopoly Committee, which alleged that the company abused its monopoly position in the gas transit market. Gazprom appealed the fine, and the <a href="http://www.scourt.gov.ua/clients/vsu/vsuen.nsf">Supreme Court</a> [official website] refused to open the case.</p>

<p>Last year, the European Commission <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/eu-charges-gazprom-with-abusing-gas-markets.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a Statement of Objection to Gazprom, accusing the Russian gas giant of abusing its position as the dominant source of gas in Central and Eastern European in breach of EU anti-trust rules. According to the Commission, "Gazprom wass the dominant gas supplier in a number of Central and Eastern European countries. Its market share well above 50% and in some cases up to 100% in these markets." The European Commission believes Gazprom is breaking EU antitrust rules by implementing a strategy to "partition Central and Eastern European" with the goal of perpetuating unfair pricing policies in EU member states. Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) prohibited the abuse of a dominant market position, which may affect trade between Member States.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/WhoWeAre.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20555&LangID=E">warned</a> [press release] Thursday that conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) will deteriorate unless there is accountability for the atrocities against civilians. Earlier this week there was an attack in Kinshasa that resulted in the deaths of civilians and police officers. Additionally, the commissioner found that in response to these events, the police were conducting raids that violated the autonomy and human rights of civilians by preventing their free movement. The commissioner warned that these were clear violations of fundamental rights and democratic principles. He cautioned that unless there is unity among the country to prosecute those responsible these atrocities, they may continue.<blockquote>I am deeply saddened by the recent explosion of violence in the capital Kinshasa. The high number of civilian casualties, the burning of the headquarters of several political parties and the continuing high tension together provide a stark warning that a large-scale crisis could be just around the corner. The writing is on the wall, and the authorities need to pull back from their extremely confrontational position and build bridges with the opposition.</blockquote>Zeid pledged his office's support in aiding the Congolese government in their investigations.</p>

<p>The DRC and surrounding regions have seen a high level of conflict in the past several decades contributing to increased concerns about human rights abuses and displacement of civilians. Zeid and UN <a href="http://www.un.org/sg/">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/un-top-officials-over-human-rights-violations-in-congo.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] in April over reports coming out of the DRC regarding an apparent government security operation in an area of southern Brazzaville known as the Pool. In January Ban urged African leaders to avoid using loopholes and undemocratic constitutional changes to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-sg-urges-african-leaders-to-avoid-using-loopholes-to-cling-to-power.php">"cling to power"</a> [JURIST report]. Last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/hrw-drc-using-excessive-force-against-protestors.php">protests and demonstrations</a> [JURIST report] took place across the DRC to oppose the proposed changes in the law that would allow DRC President Joseph Kabila to extend his presidential term past the allotted two-year limit, and the government was accused of using excessive force against these protesters.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Independent UN human rights expert <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/IntOrder/Pages/AlfredDeZayas.aspx">Alfred de Zayas</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20560&LangID=E"> said</a> [press release] Thursday that "[a]rms deals are a major threat to security, peace and human rights." De Zayas, the UN Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, explained that the arms deals often bring with them the risk that the weapons will be used in a manner "contravening international law and human rights treaties" as well as the possibility that they will be used to commit war crimes. He urged states to "abstain" from engaging in arms deals, adding that those who do engage in arms deals cannot be granted military aid and instead stressed that these nations should "work collaboratively on resolving the root causes of local, regional and international conflict, often emerging from the unrepresentative nature of governments, great injustices and inequalities prevailing in the world, the race for natural resources and the asymmetries of trade relations."</p>

<p>This is not the first time that arms deals have come under fire. In March two human rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/rights-groups-urge-countries-to-stop-selling-arms-to-saudi-arabia.php">called</a> [JURIST report] for the US, UK and France to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia due to accusations and evidence that the weapons are being used in attacks against Yemen. Also in March the Dutch parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/dutch-parliament-approves-ban-on-arms-exports-to-saudi-arabia.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] that would ban weapon exports to Saudi Arabia. In May <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy website]  <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/amnesty-urges-us-to-stop-arms-transfers-to-egypt.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU officials to adhere to a 2013 suspension on arms transfers with Egypt in order to prevent human rights violations.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Human rights groups <a href="https://www.hrw.org">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW), <a href="https://www.amnesty.org">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and the <a href="http://www.acjps.org">African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies</a> (ACJPS) [advocacy websites] on Thursday <a href="http://www.acjps.org/acjpsaihrw-sudan-no-justice-for-protester-killings/">reported</a> [report] that justice still has not been achieved for the victims of the violent protest in Khartoum in September 2013 in which some protesters were killed. Saying that "[a]lthough it seems like Sudan has succeeded in sweeping the horrific violence of September 2013 under the carpet, victims' families still demand justice," ACJPS urged the Sudanese government to hold those responsible accountable. As many as 185 protesters were killed protesting anti-austerity measures and many more were killed or unlawfully detained, some even facing torture during their detention.</p>

<p>The human rights situation throughout Sudan has drawn global condemnation of Sudan's political leaders. In March HRW reported that <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/human-rights-watch-calls-on-sudan-to-protect-women-activist.php">female rights activists</a> [JURIST report] in Sudan are facing harassment, violence and other rights abuses. Earlier this month South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a lower court's ruling that the state broke the law by <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-court-rejects-governments-appeal-over-failure-to-arrest-bashir.php">not detaining</a> [JURIST report] Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir despite an International Criminal Court order to do so. In February a UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-expert-conflict-in-sudan-must-end-immediately.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to conflict in Darfur between the Sudanese government and the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid, which may have led to human rights abuses and violations of international law. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://courts.ky.gov/courts/supreme/Pages/supremecourt.aspx">Kentucky Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://162.114.92.72/Opinions/2016-SC-000272-TG.PDF#xml=http://162.114.92.72/dtsearch.asp?cmd=pdfhits&DocId=5221&Index=D%3a%5cInetpub%5cwwwroot%5cindices%5cSupremeCourt%5fIndex&HitCount=3&hits=37+d3+48c3+&hc=3&req=Bevin">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that <a href="http://governor.ky.gov/Pages/index.aspx">Governor Matt Bevin</a> [official website] did not have the authority to unilaterally cut the budget for state universities. The ruling came after a <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/kentucky-ag-files-suit-against-governor-over-university-funding-cuts.php">lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] was filed by <a href="http://ag.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear</a> [official website]. The 5-2 decision reverses a lower court ruling, which found that Bevin did have the authority to make such cuts. After Bevin took office, he requested a 4.5 percent cut across Kentucky's state budget. However, after failing to gain the state legislature'ss support, Bevin <a href="http://wuky.org/post/bevin-orders-college-university-budgets-cut-45-percent#stream/0">issued</a> [WUKY report] an order imposing the cuts on the state university and community college system.</p>

<p>Education funding has led to numerous legal challenges across the US. The Supreme Court of Washington last year <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/washington-supreme-court-fines-state-for-inadequate-school-funding.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the state to pay a fine of $100,000 per day for each day that it fails to comply with a previous court ruling mandating adequate funding of public schools. Also in August of last year the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/senate-passes-bill-to-revamp-no-child-left-behind-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to revamp the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act. The US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/us-court-upholds-regulations-on-loans-at-for-profit-college-loans.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in July of last year in favor of tight regulations pointed at the for-profit college industry. The court ruled that the Education Department has the right to demand that schools show that their graduates are financially dependent enough to repay their student loans. In August 2014 a judge for a Travis County Civil Court in Texas <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/texas-judge-rules-education-budget-cuts-unconstitutional.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Texas legislature failed to meet its constitutional duty to provide for Texas public schools because the school finance system is structured, operated, and funded so that it cannot provide a constitutionally reasonable education for all Texas schoolchildren.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Advocacy groups on Thursday filed a <a href="http://www.southerncoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Complaint-Final.pdf">lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] challenging the redrawn boundaries for North Carolina's congressional seats. Plaintiffs are <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/22/north-carolinas-congress-map-again-facing-a-challe/">arguing</a> [AP report] that the district lines were influenced by politics. Some of the parties involved in the suit are the <a href="http://lwv.org/">League of Women Voters</a> [advocacy website] and Democratic voters. They <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/north-carolinas-congress-map-again-facing-challenge-193023854.html">claim</a> [AP report], unlike previous plaintiffs in similar suits, that they have a method to measure excessive partisanship. The lawsuit is requesting that the current map be discarded and new lines be drawn for the districts. The lawsuit claims that the current map did not consider race. These allegations come after a <a href="http://www.commoncause.org/press/press-releases/common-cause-files-landmark.html?referrer=http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/2016/09/22/another-court-challenge-seeks-to-overturn-ncs-partisan-gerrymandering/">federal lawsuit</a> [press release] was filed last month of illegal partisan gerrymandering.</p>

<p>Voting rights remain a controversial legal issue in the US. In June a three-judge panel <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/three-judge-panel-upholds-north-carolinas-newly-drawn-voting-districts.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] North Carolina's voting districts. In April the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-unanimously-upholds-arizona-redistricting-decision.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a redistricting decision in Arizona as not discriminatory. Earlier that same month a panel of federal judges rejected a motion by Representative Corrine Brown <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-court-refuses-to-alter-florida-congressional-district-boundaries.php">challenging the current congressional district boundaries in Florida</a> [JURIST report]. Last year the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/supreme-court-rules-states-may-use-commissions-for-redistricting.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the Elections Clause of the US Constitution permits the state of Arizona to adopt a commission to draw congressional districts. In April of last year the court <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/supreme-court-throws-out-ruling-on-north-carolina-redistricting.php">threw out</a> [JURIST report] a North Carolina court ruling that upheld Republican-drawn electoral districts for state and congressional lawmakers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sgsm18127.doc.htm">called on</a> [press release] the international community to intensify its efforts to protect cultural treasures against enemy combatants in regions devastated by conflict. Ban specifically directed attention to attacks on cultural heritage sites in the Middle East, North Africa, Yemen and Mali among others, and termed such kinds of attacks "war crimes." The UN has been making its own independent efforts to restore and rebuild damaged sites. In Timbuktu, a city known for its rich history and cultural heritage sites, <a href="http://en.unesco.org/">UNESCO</a> [official website] helped rebuild 14 mausoleums and in the process recovered hundreds of thousands of ancient manuscripts. Pointing out that "Combatants that attack cultural treasures want to damage more than artefacts&#8212;they aim to tear at the fabric of societies," Ban stated: "Today, I call on the international community to intensify the global response to attacks on cultural heritage. We have a strong legal basis that we must apply through action to protect treasures and end illicit trafficking. When we 'Unite for Heritage,' we will advance our broader campaign for a more just, peaceful and sustainable future."</p>

<p>Last month the <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/malian-jihadist-pleads-guilty-to-destroying-timbuktu-shrines-at-start-of-icc-trial.php">opened its first trial</a> [JURIST report] for the destruction of historical and religious monuments. Malian Justice Minister Malick Coulibaly had said in July 2012 that he <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/mali-to-ask-icc-to-investigate-potential-war-crimes.php">would ask</a> [JURIST report] the ICC to open an investigation into the destruction of Timbuktu's mausoleums. Minister Coulibaly's announcement came after ICC Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/icc-chief-prosecutor-calls-for-end-to-destruction-of-mali-religious-shrines.php">told reporters</a> [JURIST report] that attacks by Islamist rebels on religious monuments in Mali would not be tolerated and destruction of tombs of ancient Muslim saints in Timbuktu likely amounted to war crimes. Conflicts in Timbuktu took place against a background of significant domestic turmoil, as Malian soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/mali-soldiers-take-control-of-government-suspend-constitution.php">took control of the government</a> and suspended the constitution in March of that year, leading to what Amnesty International characterized as the nation's <a href="/paperchase/2012/05/mali-facing-human-rights-crisis-amnesty.php">worst human rights crisis</a> [JURIST reports] since it gained independence in 1960.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>International human rights groups, including <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy websites], issued a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/22/urgent-need-international-inquiry-yemen">joint letter</a> [text] on Thursday to the permanent representatives of member and observer states of the UN Human Rights Council urging them "to support the High Commissioner's call for an international, independent investigation into civilian deaths and injuries in Yemen." Pointing out that nearly 3,800 civilians have been killed and more than 6,700 wounded since March 2015, the letter claimed that "the council has missed critical opportunities to address alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Yemen." Numerous kinds of human rights and humanitarian violations were cited by the letter including, airstrikes that have repeatedly hit homes, hospitals, markets, civilian factories and schools; laying of internationally banned antipersonnel landmines; arbitrary detention of civilians; raiding offices of non-governmental organizations, and blocking of the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians. Stating that "No valid human rights-based reason has been identified that would justify failing to create an international inquiry," the groups warned that "If the Council once again fails to create an international inquiry, it will have shirked its mandate to promote accountability, failed to help provide victims of violations in Yemen the justice to which they are entitled, and undermined its own credibility as the Council marks its tenth anniversary."</p>

<p>The rapidly deteriorating situation in Yemen has sparked significant international concern. Last month the UN High Commissioner for human rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile], <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-high-commissioner-calls-for-creation-of-independent-international-body.php">called on the international community</a> [JURIST report] to establish an independent international body for conducting comprehensive investigations of human rights violations in Yemen. According to a <a href="www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/YE/OHCHRYemen_report2016_EN.docx">report</a>  [text, DOC] from the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> (OHCHR) released in August, the civilian death estimate was at only <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-office-yemen-civilian-death-toll-reaches-nearly-2800.php">2,800 in January</a> [JURIST report], which would mean that approximately another 1,000 have died in as little as nine months. The report further indicates that an approximate 7.6 million people, including three million women and children, are currently suffering from malnutrition and at least three million people have been displaced from their homes. The OHCHR <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-office-condemns-attacks-in-residential-areas-of-yemen.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] a string of rocket and mortar attacks against residential areas and markets in Taizz, Yemen, from June 3 to June 8. In March <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-use-of-cluster-bombs-in-yemen-may-be-war-crime.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that the use of cluster bombs by the Saudi-led coalition against neighborhoods in Yemen may amount to a war crime. In January the UN <a href="http://www.wfp.org/">World Food Programme</a> [official website] appealed to all the parties involved in the Yemen conflict to <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-wfp-to-parties-in-yemen-conflict-allow-food-distributions-in-taiz.php">allow the safe passage of food</a> [JURIST report] to the city of Taiz. In October AI <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/amnesty-urges-war-crime-investigation-into-yemen-hospital-air-strike.php">called for</a> [JURIST report] an independent investigation into possible war crimes surrounding the destruction of a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Yemen. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN experts <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20566&LangID=E">condemned</a> [text] Australia Friday for its laws allowing indefinite detention of intellectually disabled persons facing criminal charges. Under the current law, if a person is found unfit to plead to a charge against them, they may be held in custody for an unspecified amount of time. Such prisoners may not come before a court until they are found to understand the idea of "criminal responsibility." The legislation, the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/num_act/clida199670o1996414/clida199670o1996414.pdf">Criminal Law (Mentally Impaired Defendants) Act 1996</a> [text, PDF], led to an Aboriginal man being detained for 10 years without having the charges against him determined. Marlon James Noble was conditionally released in 2012. The UN urged Australia to amend its law and provide Noble with, "an effective remedy." The UN highlighted that Australia has ratified its <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRPD/Pages/ConventionRightsPersonsWithDisabilities.aspx">Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a> [materials], requiring each nation to recognize the equal legal rights of disabled people on par with all other citizens.  </p>

<p>The promotion of rights for persons with disabilities is a critical issue around the world. Last month the UN released a statement that women with disabilities face discrimination and are often <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-experts-women-with-disabilities-should-be-empowered.php">excluded from freely participating in society</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier that month the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit against the state of Georgia alleging the "<a href="/paperchase/2016/08/doj-sues-georgia-for-segregating-students-with-disabilities.php">unnecessary segregation of persons with disabilities in state programs, services, and activities</a>" [JURIST report]. In April the advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) claimed France is <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-france-prisons-neglecting-inmates-mental-health.php">failing to provide adequate mental health care</a> [JURIST report] and appropriate conditions for prisoners with psychosocial disabilities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea Manning, a former US soldier imprisoned for leaking classified documents, was sentenced on Thursday to two weeks of solitary confinement as a punishment for a suicide attempt, as well as for keeping a banned book in her quarters. According to a <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/150813426803/breaking-prison-disciplinary-board-decides-to">statement </a> [text] released by <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Furture</a> [advocacy website], an advocacy group supporting Manning, seven days of the sentence will be suspended on conditions of Manning's behavior over the next six months. Manning <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/lawyers-confirm-chelsea-manning-attempted-suicide-160712055644219.html">attempted to take her own life</a> [Al Jazeera report] in July. </p>

<p>According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Manning was being <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/chelsea-manning-facing-new-charges-after-suicide-attempt.php">investigated</a> [JURIST report] in July for charges in relation to a suicide attempt at the facility. At the time, ACLU Staff Attorney Chase Strangio issued a statement in which he was deeply critical of the Army's handling of Manning, in particular the "denial of medical care related to her gender transition" despite "the treatment [being] recognized as necessary." Earlier this month Manning ended a five-day <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/chelsea-manning-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-prison-treatment.php">hunger strike</a> after the Army agreed to allow her to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/chelsea-manning-to-undergo-gender-reassignment-surgery-following-hunger-strike.php">undergo gender reassignment surgery</a> [JURIST report]. In May Manning <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/chelsea-manning-appeals-35-year-sentence.php">appealed</a> [JURIST report] her 35-year prison sentence. In 2013 Manning filed for a <a href="/paperchase/2013/09/wikileaks-defendant-applies-for-presidential-pardon.php">presidential pardon</a> [JURIST report] of the 35-year sentence. The sentence came a month after she was <a href="/paperchase/2013/07/wikileaks-informant-found-not-guilty-of-aiding-the-enemy-convicted-of-espionage.php">found guilty</a> [JURIST report] of violating the Espionage Act but was acquitted of the more serious charge of "aiding the enemy." The judge had raised the <a href="/paperchase/2013/04/judge-raises-standard-of-proof-in-wikileaks-case.php">burden of proof</a> [JURIST report] in order to require the government to prove that Manning "knowingly" aided al Qaeda. Manning <a href="/paperchase/2013/02/wikileaks-defendant-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charges.php">pleaded guilty</a> [JURIST report] to 10 of the 22 charges against her for providing classified materials to WikiLeaks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A UN human rights expert on Friday urged the US government to <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20570&LangID=E">halt the construction</a> [press release] of the Dakota Access oil pipeline out of respect for the rights of affected Native Americans. Earlier this month the North Dakota pipeline's construction was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-dakota-pipeline-construction-suspended-by-request-of-us-government.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] after the US Departments of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Justice</a>, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/">Interior</a> and <a href="https://www.army.mil/">Army</a> [official websites] released a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/joint-statement-department-justice-department-army-and-department-interior-regarding-standing">joint statement</a> [text] stating the need to reconsider the pipeline's effect on the neighboring <a href="http://standingrock.org/">Standing Rock Sioux Tribe</a> [official website]. Special Rapporteur Victoria Tauli-Corpuz stressed that the tribe should have been properly consulted during the initial stages of planning and construction. Tauli-Corpuz also denounced the intimidation and harassment of protesters and tribal leaders, stating that the US government must abide to international standards regarding the rights of indigenous people. In light of the current situation, Tauli-Corpuz called on the the US <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the <a href="http://www.achp.gov/">Advisory Council on Historic Preservation</a> (ACHP) [official websites] to work towards an amendment of the law requiring tribal consultation and consent for matters that effect Native Americans. </p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples remain a pressing international legal topic. In this case a federal judge had <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-judge-halts-construction-of-north-dakota-oil-pipeline-near-tribal-land.php">issued</a> [JURIST report] a temporary injunction to halt building earlier this month, with the caveat that it would be superseded by his later ruling. In other indigenous matters, a federal appeals court in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-allows-alaska-natives-to-place-land-in-federal-trust.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Alaska's challenge in a case determining the right of Alaskan tribes to place land in a federal trust. In May Canada's Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-adopts-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] it would drop its objector status against the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In April JURIST Guest Columnist Dwight Newman of the University of Saskatchewan <a href="/forum/2016/04/Dwight-Newman-indigenous-rights.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] what is happening with recent leave decisions related to Indigenous rights and Canadian energy regulation. In March Canadian indigenous people, including Inuits of Nunavut and the Chippewa, were <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/inuit-appeal-seismic-testing-case-to-canadas-highest-court.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, challenging the use of seismic testing to find natural gas under the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay. In February experts from the UN and the Inter-American human rights systems <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-call-on-canada-to-address-violence-against-indigenous-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Canada to address the "root causes" of the extreme violence and discrimination against indigenous women and girls in that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HighCommissioner.aspx">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> [official profile] on Friday urged the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to end its pattern of expelling and detaining migrants contrary to international standards. Numerous Central European countries have recently <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20567&LangID=E">closed their borders</a> [UN report] to fight the influx of migrants, and many migrant families have found themselves either trapped in Macedonian transit centers or forced into neighboring countries as a result. Zeid strongly denounced the treatment of such families, stressing that all migrants deserve not only adequate living requirements but also opportunity for employment and education. Zeid also expressed concern over the country's <a href="http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?reldoc=y&docid=53072de34">Asylum Law</a> [text, PDF], which significantly hinders the ability for migrants to be granted legal asylum upon request. Reportedly 600 migrants have sought legal asylum since 2015 yet only five have actually succeeded. Zeid called on Macedonia and neighboring countries to address the ongoing suffering and mistreatment of all migrant families and abide by international law. </p>

<p>The rights of migrant populations has emerged as one of the most significant humanitarian issues around the world, as millions seek asylum from conflict nations. Earlier this week a senior UN official <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-official-unveils-principles-regarding-rights-of-migrants-and-refugees.php">unveiled</a> [JURIST report] a draft set of principles aimed at continuing momentum toward the protection of human rights of refugees and migrants. Ahead of the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants this week, UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/un-rights-experts-urge-states-to-protect-women-and-girls-in-migration.php">experts urged</a> [JURIST report] states to protect women and girls in the movement of refugees and migrants by adhering to international human rights conventions and standards. Last week <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy websites] said that the draft of the final outcome document for the UN summit on refugees fell short of dealing with the issue <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/rights-groups-un-summit-falling-short-on-refugee-issues.php">effectively</a> [JURIST report]. According to the rights groups, the UN is missing an opportunity by not proposing anything of substance. Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/austria-threatens-lawsuit-against-hungary-over-migrant-acceptance.php">said</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month that Austria will take Hungary to the International Court of Justice if Hungary does not begin accepting returning migrants that crossed into Austria from Hungary. Last month Zeid <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-bulgaria-arresting-migrants-cause-for-concern.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over Bulgaria's criminalization of migrants leaving and entering the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/23/veto-message-president-s2040">vetoed</a> [press release] a bill that would have allowed 9/11 victims and their families to sue Saudi Arabia, citing concerns that it would open US diplomats and servicemen to suit abroad. Congress overwhelmingly approved the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2040">Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act</a> (JASTA) [text] earlier this year, with support from both parties for the bill that would allow federal suits against foreign nations determined to have had a hand in terror acts. In rejecting the law, Obama stated:<blockquote>I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts. ... First, [I cannot sign the bill because] JASTA threatens to reduce the effectiveness of our response to indications that a foreign government has taken steps outside our borders to provide support for terrorism, by taking such matters out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts. ... Second, JASTA would upset longstanding international principles regarding sovereign immunity, putting in place rules that, if applied globally, could have serious implications for U.S. national interests.</blockquote>Both major presidential candidates criticized Obama's veto decision that put him at odds with Congress, which is expected to overrule his veto in the near future. </p>

<p>The White House Press Secretary Paul Earnest <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/white-house-says-obama-will-veto-911-victims-bill.php">announced</a> earlier this month that Obama intended to veto the bill, shortly after the bill was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/us-house-approves-bill-allowing-911-families-to-sue-saudi-arabia.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] by the US House of Representatives. The Act was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/us-senate-approves-bill-allowing-saudi-arabia-to-be-sued-for-911-attacks.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Senate in May. In 2012 a US District judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-dismisses-motion-to-reinstate-saudi-arabia-as-911-defendant.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Saudi Arabia as a defendant in a civil compensation lawsuit by victims against the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim against Saudi Arabia was dismissed in 2008 by a US Appeals Court due to insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes has actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the attacks. In 2005 Judge Richard Casey <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that all had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Gabon's <a href="http://www.cour-constitutionnelle.ga/">Constitutional Court</a> on Saturday upheld incumbent president <a href="http://presidence-gabon.ga/">Ali Bongo Ondimba</a>'s victory over challenger <a href="http://jeanping.org/">Jean Ping</a> [official websites, in French], despite calls for a recount based on alleged vote rigging. Ping's allegations focused on the Haut-Ogooue province, where Bongo received 95 percent of votes on a 99 percent turnout. The court did not overturn the vote or demand a recount, and instead it increased the percentage of votes in Bongo's favor, from 49.8 to 50.6 percent. On Ping's warning to the court that unrest would follow a decision in Bongo's favor, the court announced that Ping would be held accountable for any subsequent violence. </p>

<p>The Constitutional Court's ruling comes just days after Gabon's Ambassador to the US <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/gabon-court-to-recount-presidential-election-votes.php">said</a> [JURIST report] that ballots from the contested presidential election would be recounted, after Bongo won by less than 10,000 votes. Ping <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/gabon-opposition-candidate-challenges-validity-of-election.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] the complaint with the Constitutional Court earlier this month after a report released last week by Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/amnesty-gabon-security-forces-using-excessive-force-against-protesters-after-election.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Gabon security forces for using excessive force against protesters after the country's disputed election.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=499">Chief Justice Patricia Breckenridge</a> [official profile] of the Missouri Supreme Court <a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/page.jsp?id=105936">announced</a> [text] at the joint annual meeting of the Missouri Bar and the Judicial Conference in Lake Ozark on Thursday new mandatory standards of practice and procedure for municipal courts within the state. The new mandatory standards are being imposed as a response to the many accusations levied against the municipal courts. The Chief Justice made specific references in this regard to media headlines concerning violations of civil rights and disparate treatment between individuals of different levels of income, race or both. The Chief Justice's own personal observations during unannounced visits to the various regional courts revealed, among other things: that courts had been closing every weekday much earlier than the required hours of operation; prohibition against entry of children into courtrooms; inadequate separation of powers between the police and staff members of the courts; and inappropriate seating of prosecutors behind the bench with the judge during proceedings, raising concerns of conflict of interest. The Chief Justice stated: "I experienced first-hand what citizens in our state must encounter every day. I felt frustrated and angry." </p>

<p>The Chief Justice announced <a href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/sup/index.nsf/d45a7635d4bfdb8f8625662000632638/c908dc0681884e13862580340051c22b?OpenDocument">minimum operating standards</a> [order, PDF] requiring municipal courts to: 1) ensure that individuals detained are so held in custody in strict compliance with the principles of due process of law; 2) permit individuals to present any information on their capacity or lack thereof to pay court costs and fines; 3) not condition access to judicial hearing or probationary grant on payment of fines and costs; 4) not collect unauthorized fines, costs, or surcharges; 5) lawfully select authorized, educated, qualified and adequately prepared and trained judges; 6) operate municipal divisions in a manner reasonably convenient to the public; 7) operate municipal division in such a manner as to uphold "the constitutional principles of separation of powers and the integrity of the judiciary as a separate and independent branch of government;" 8) operate the municipal divisions "in accordance with the constitutional principles and legal requirements of open courts and open records;" 9) notify litigants and other concerned individuals of their appropriate rights; and 10) maintain appropriate oversight of municipal divisions through the circuit court presiding judges of the respective judicial circuits. The minimum operating standards also require adherence to various other subsets of rules both within and outside of the standards mentioned above. Acknowledging that some of these standards may be unpopular, the Chief Justice expressed hope that they can affect "meaningful improvement" in court practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit</a> [official website] on Friday <a href="http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/16a0241p-06.pdf">struck down</a> [opinion, PDF] a procedure implemented by the <a href="https://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/">Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted</a> [official website] that effectively eliminated inactive voters from registration rolls if they failed to respond to letters requesting confirmation of their status and addresses. The suit was filed by the A. Philip Randolph Institute, the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless, and Larry Harmon, who sought to enjoin the Secretary from removing the names of registered voters from Ohio's voter rolls on the contention that such a procedure violates the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</a> (NVRA) [text] and <a href="http://www.eac.gov/assets/1/workflow_staging/Page/41.PDF">Help America Vote Act of 2002</a> (HAVA) [text, PDF]. The Secretary has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-appeals-court-rules-against-ohio-voter-roll-purges/2016/09/23/67c1311e-81b4-11e6-a52d-9a865a0ed0d4_story.html">indicated</a> [WP report] that he may be appealing this decision if it requires the state to reinstate the eligibility of voters who have moved out of Ohio.</p>

<p>The right to vote has become especially contentious as the presidential election approaches. Earlier this month the Missouri legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/missouri-legislature-overrides-veto-on-voter-id-and-gun-laws.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] vetoes by Governor Jay Nixon to approve two bills, one requiring voter ID and the other removing the need to renew permits in order to carry a concealed weapon. Last month an Oklahoma court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial voter ID law allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. In July voter restrictions were overturned in <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two former employees of <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">Wells Fargo</a> [corporate website] filed a <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Polonsky-v.-Wells-Fargo-Bank-Co.-BC634475-California-Superior-Court-Los-Angeles-County.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> [complaint, PDF] on Thursday on behalf of employees whom they claim were penalized over the last 10 years for following the rules and not meeting sales quotas. The lawsuit seeks $2.6 billion in damages or possibly more for allegations that include wrongful termination, unlawful business practices and failure to pay wages. According to the lawsuit, Wells Fargo was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-lawsuit-idUSKCN11U0NY">aware</a> [Reuters report] that their strict sales quotas were leading bankers to fraudulently open accounts for customers. The plaintiffs allege that the biggest victims of this were employees who did not engage in these practices. </p>

<p>Over the past several years, Wells Fargo has been the subject of various administrative and judicial action. Earlier this month, the Consumer Protection agency <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/consumer-agency-fines-wells-fargo-us-100-million.php">fined</a> [JURIST report] Wells Fargo $100 million for various violations, including the opening of fraudulent accounts. Customers also filed a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/wells-fargo-customers-file-suit-against-the-bank-for-fraudulent-accounts.php">class action lawsuit</a> alleging invasion of privacy, fraud, negligence and breach of contract. In 2014 a US District Court approved a <a href="/paperchase/2014/08/federal-judge-approves-final-settlement-in-wells-fargo-investment-case.php">$62.5 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] between the bank and large institutional clients who lost money in a securities lending program. In 2013 a federal judge imposed a <a href="/paperchase/2013/05/wells-fargo-ordered-to-pay-203-million-for-misleading-customers.php">$203 million penalty</a> [JURIST report] against the bank in a class-action suit alleging the bank misled customers and charged excessive overdraft fees.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www2.stf.jus.br/portalStfInternacional/cms/verPrincipal.php?idioma=en_us">Brazil Supreme Court</a> [official website] approved a motion by prosecutors to open a preliminary investigation into accusations from Sergio Machado, former Transpetro head, that president Michel Temer sought illegal campaign donations in 2012. It was revealed by the Supreme Court in June that portions of Machado's plea bargain testimony allege that Temer requested contribution from an engineering group in relation to Sao Paulo's 2012 mayoral campaign, which was legal but resulted from illegal kickbacks on contracts with Petrobras. Transpetro is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company, which is currently the subject of Brazil's largest corruption scandal to date. Temer, the former vice president of now-impeached Dilma Rousseff, has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-probe-idUSKCN11U01D">denied the accusations</a> [Reuters report].</p>

<p>More than 100 individuals and 50 politicians have been arrested in connection to the Petrobras scandal that continues to plague the country as it prepares for the upcoming summer Olympics. Earlier this week a Brazilian judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-former-president-to-be-tried-on-corruption-charges.php">accepted charges</a> [JURIST report] against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva relating to the Petrobas Oil Scandal. In July da Silva <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/former-brazil-president-appeals-to-un-for-rights-violation-in-corruption-investigation-1.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] a petition with the UN Human Rights Committee, claiming that his corruption investigation has been riddled with impartiality and abuse of power by the judge. In May Brazil's Supreme court <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-house-speaker-suspended-for-obstructing-corruption-investigation.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha after being suspected of obstructing investigations into his allegedly corrupt activities. Also in May local media in Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/brazil-prosecutors-call-for-investigation-of-president.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that the country's top prosecutors had requested an investigation into sitting-President Dilma Rousseff over alleged connections to the Petrobras corruption scandal. In April the Supreme Federal Court in Brazil <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/high-court-in-brazil-orders-legislature-to-commence-impeachment-procedures-against-vice-president---.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the legislature to commence impeachment proceedings against Temer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attacks in Aleppo, Syria's capital, were called a "breach of international humanitarian law" in a <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/nuclear-safety/10414/joint-statement-on-the-situation-in-aleppo_en">joint statement</a> [text] by EU officials on Saturday. The EU is urging countries with influence on the parties to encourage negotiations to cease the attacks and allow humanitarian aid to victims in need. Suffering in Aleppo has become worse in the last 48 hours, according to the officials. They denounced the targeting of a humanitarian convoy, which was hit by an airstrike last week. Because of this, many civilians in Aleppo were deprived of water supplies. According to UN officials, millions more civilians were also left <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-25/aleppo-attacks-'breach'-humanitarian-law/7875374">without water</a> [AFP report] after attacks damaged a pumping station. The EU said it will review actions it could take to help parties in negotiations. </p>

<p>The <a href="/feature/featured/syria-1/">conflict in Syria</a> [JURIST backgrounder] has continued for five years in a civil war surrounding the legitimacy of Bashar al-Assad. Earlier this month Russian officials <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/russia-us-air-strikes-that-killed-syria-forces-could-threaten-ceasefire-agreement.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that a US-led airstrike that killed Syrian troops could threaten the ceasefire agreed upon between Syrian and opposition forces. In August a top UN official submitted a report detailing an in-depth investigation into <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-syria-wracked-by-chemical-warfare.php">chemical warfare</a> [JURIST report] used by Islamic State and Assad in Syria. That same month Amnesty International said that a suspected chlorine gas attack in Aleppo could <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/amnesty-syria-chlorine-gas-attack-could-be-war-crime.php">amount to a war crime</a> [JURIST report]. In July Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/hrw-use-of-cluster-bombs-reignited-in-northern-syria.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] cluster bombs have been targeted at civilians and rebels in Northern Syria. In June UN human rights experts called for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/un-rights-experts-urge-protection-of-civilians-in-syria.php">immediate protection</a> [JURIST report] of thousands of Syrian civilians.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ambacongo-us.org/en-us/aboutcongo/diplomacy/overview.aspx">Foreign Minister of the Republic of Congo</a> [embassy website], Jean-Claude Gakosso, <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55105#.V-gUBvDx42x">embraced the country's new constitution</a> [UN News Centre] on Saturday before the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/">UN General Assembly</a> [official website], which he said will improve political, economic and social governance. The new constitution, which Gakosso said was "more adapted to the requirements of the rule of law in its most commonly accepted sense," is structured on the separation of powers, particularly entrenching the independence of the judiciary, and abolishes the death penalty, works towards equalizing education opportunities for both genders, and recognizes fundamental rights of indigenous peoples. In addition, the constitution laid the groundwork for a more participative democracy. Finally, Gakosso reiterated his belief that the new constitution will "improve the political, economic and social governance in [the Congo]."</p>

<p>Last year the Republic of the Congo's electoral commission announced that voters had <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/congo-voters-approve-referendum-extending-presidential-term-limits.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] an amendment to the <a href="http://www.presidence.cg/files/my_files/constit200102.pdf">constitution</a> [text, PDF, in French] that would allow President Denis Sassou Nguesso to extend his term in office. The amendment, approved by the citizens of the Congo in a referendum, allows presidents to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/congo-government-announces-referendum-on-extending-presidential-term-limits.php">renew</a> [JURIST report] their term twice and removes the age limit for presidential candidates, currently set at 70. Nguesso, who is 72 and serving his second term, would be ineligible for the presidency without the amendment. Before being elected to office in 2002, he also served as president from 1979 to 1992. With the referendum approved, Nguesso plans on seeking another term in office in the next election. While officials claimed a 72 percent voter turnout in the referendum, opposition leaders said turnout was under 10 percent and had <a href="http://www.voanews.com/content/congo-voters-approve-referendum-allowing-president-bid-for-third-term/3024424.html">called for results to be annulled</a> [VOA report]. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bosnian Serbs <a href="http://www.predsjednikrs.net/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D1%81%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BE/">voted in a referendum</a> [press release, in Serbian] Sunday to maintain January 9 as a national holiday in defiance of a court ruling. The date remembers January 9, 1992, when ethnic Serbians declared their own state within Bosnia and triggered a deadly conflict in which it is estimated 100,000 people died. The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina had banned the referendum, and had originally ruled that the date should be changed because it discriminated against Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats. Republika Srpska <a href="http://www.predsjednikrs.net/">President Milorad Dodik</a> [official website], who had <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/republic-of-srpska-assembly-sets-date-for-referendum-on-statehood-day.php">set the date</a> [JURIST report] for the vote, <a href="http://www.predsjednikrs.net/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%98%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA-%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D1%81%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B5-%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%BE-14/">said he was proud</a> [press release, in Serbian] of the peaceful manner in which the referendum passed.  </p>

<p>Tensions between the ethnic Bosnian and Serbian populations of the former Yugoslavian states continue to be emotionally charged, years after the Balkan war. The <a href="/feature/featured/icty/">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a> (ICTY) [JURIST backgrounder] and the Balkan States continue to prosecute those accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity that left more than 100,000 people dead and millions displaced during the conflict. In March the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/icty-acquits-serbian-nationalist-seselj-of-all-balkan-war-crimes.php#">acquitted</a> [JURIST report] Vojislav Šešelj, president of the Serbian Radical Party and former Assembly member of Serbia, of all crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the Balkan war. In May 2015 the ICTY <a href="/paperchase/2015/05/icty-orders-serbia-to-return-seselj-to-detention.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] Serbia's justice ministry to <a href="/forum/2015/02/gregory-gordon-seselj-release.php">return Šešelj to his detention cell immediately</a> [JURIST op-ed] after he was released in February to return to Serbia for cancer treatment. The ICTY had <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/icty-orders-serbian-nationalist-seselj-to-return-to-court.php">revoked his provisional release</a> [JURIST report] in March 2015 because Šešelj spoke at a news conference in Belgrade and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-war-crimes-tribunal-orders-serb-nationalist-vojislav-seselj-back-to-detention-1427715609">stated</a> [WSJ report] that he would not return voluntarily to The Hague.   </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistani police are <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/26/pakistan-overhaul-abusive-police-force">committing serious human rights abuses</a> [press release], <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> (HRW) [advocacy website] reported Monday, calling for a complete overhaul of the country's police system. The <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/09/25/crooked-system/police-abuse-and-reform-pakistan">report</a> [text], "This Crooked System," looks at the history of the Pakistani police and details occurrences of arbitrary arrest, torture, extra-judicial killings and sexual violence, especially among religious minorities that are vulnerable to "disgruntled and corrupt" members of the force. "The rule of law won't become a reality in Pakistan unless the law enforcement forces tasked with imposing the law are also held to it," said Brad Adams, Asia director at HRW. "For this to happen, the government needs to bring changes within the system and address the improper influences outside of it."</p>

<p>Pakistan has been under pressure to improve human rights conditions for years. Last week HRW called on Pakistani authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/hrw-urges-pakistan-not-to-execute-man-with-intellectual-disability.php">halt the execution of a mentally disabled man</a> [JURIST report], saying "executing people with mental health conditions is an affront to decency and serves no criminal justice purpose." Earlier this month a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/kashmir-authorities-re-arrest-human-rights-activist.php">human rights lawyer was re-arrested in Kashmir</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier this year UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein expressed his concerns regarding Indian and Pakistani authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-chief-urges-india-and-pakistan-to-grant-access-to-kashmir.php">refusing to allow the Human Rights Council access to Kashmir</a> [JURIST report]. The UN also petitioned Pakistan earlier this year to cease rights infringement relating to a construction project that has <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-asks-pakistan-to-stop-construction-infringing-on-human-rights.php">displaced civilians and damaged sites of cultural heritage</a> [JURIST report].  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>UAE to enact stricter drone regulations</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will enact laws to have stricter regulations on the sale and operation of drones, according to a statement by the country's <a href="https://www.gcaa.gov.ae/en/Pages/Default.aspx">General Civil Aviation Authority</a> (GCAA) [official website] Monday. The regulations <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/emirates-drones-idINKCN11W160">will focus on</a> [Reuters report] imports, sales, and performance and will also address separate regulations for heavier drones and pilotless aircraft. The GCAA is currently <a href="http://www.arabianaerospace.aero/gcaa-dot-abu-dhabi-move-to-speed-drone-operations-approvals.html">developing a process</a> [<em>Arabian Aerospace</em> report] in Abu Dhabi to link drone approval systems so that private drone users can have their devices approved more quickly. The GCAA hopes this will make the air space safer. The agency currently operates an app that allows users to learn of <a href="https://www.gcaa.gov.ae/en/pages/UASRegistration.aspx">current regulations</a> [materials] and drone no-fly zones, but there have still been incidents of airport closures because of the unmanned vehicles. The GCAA has not yet set a date for the new regulations.</p>

<p>The use of <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">drones</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is controversial in both the international arena and in domestic circles. In April Human Rights Watch issued a report stating that fully autonomous weapons, as opposed to the current remote-controlled drone weapons, must be <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/hrw-fully-autonomous-weapons-must-be-internationally-prohibited.php">internationally prohibited</a> [JURIST report]. Also in April a US appeals court <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/federal-appeals-court-dismisses-request-for-drone-records.php">upheld</a> a district court's dismissal of a Freedom of Information Act request for information about the US government's use of drones for "targeted killings." In November the Second Circuit ruled that the US government <a href="https://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2015/11/drone-memos-may-stay-secret-federal-appeals-court.php">may keep secret</a> [JURIST report] memoranda related to the legal justification for the use of drones for targeted killings of those in other countries believed to be involved in terrorism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swiss voters on Sunday voted to approve a new surveillance law allowing their national intelligence service broad powers to spy on 'terrorist' suspects and cyber criminals, as well as the ability to cooperate with foreign intelligence agencies. While Switzerland is a country where the right to privacy is considered very important, the new law will allow security agents to tap phones and computer networks. This marks a drastic change from previous surveillance capabilities, as the intelligence agency relied solely on information from public sources and other authorities. Some left-wing groups have expressed their displeasure saying the new legislation violates citizens' right to privacy and will undermine Switzerland's neutrality. Likewise, Amnesty International said the law would lead to "disproportionate" levels of surveillance and was harmful to "freedom of expression." Despite some opposition, the new surveillance law garnered <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/swiss-voters-controversial-surveillance-law-160925155443740.html">65 percent of the vote</a> [Al Jazeera report] on assurances by Yannick Buttet, the Christian Democratic Party vice president, that the law is not intended to function in a manner similar to the US National Security Agency (NSA), which was exposed and criticized for setting up a vast data-gathering apparatus. The Swiss defense minister, Guy Parmelin, said Switzerland is "leaving the basement and coming up to the ground floor by international standards" of surveillance.</p>

<p>Surveillance and data collection have been a worldwide topic of discussion, particularly after Edward Snowden <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/us-citizen-charged-with-espionage-over-nsa-leaks.php">leaked top-secret</a> [JURIST report] NSA documents in 2013. Last month a UN rights groups <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-experts-warn-uk-bill-could-threaten-freedom-of-expression.php">criticized</a> [JURIST report] the Investigatory Powers Bill, stating it could threaten freedom of expression and association. In December China <a href="/paperchase/2015/12/china-passes-controversial-anti-terrorism-law.php">passed a new anti-terrorism law</a> [JURIST report] that requires technology companies to provide information to the government obtained from their products and make information systems "secure and controllable." Last October the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/federal-appeals-court-refuses-to-block-bulk-phone-data-collection.php">denied</a> [JURIST report] a motion by the American Civil Liberties Union to halt the bulk collection of phone records by the NSA. The court ruled that Congress intended for the agency to continue its data collection over the transition period, and the new legislation was to take effect November 29. In June of last year the French Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/france-parliament-adopts-new-surveillance-bill.php">adopted</a> [JURIST report] a new surveillance bill that would give French intelligence serves the authority to monitor Internet use metadata. In February 2015 the UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal <a href="/paperchase/2015/02/uk-tribunal-mass-internet-surveillance-unlawful.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the UK's mass surveillance of citizens' Internet use violates human rights law. In July 2014 civil liberties groups <a href="/paperchase/2014/07/advocacy-groups-challenge-uk-electronic-surveillance-legislation.php">sued</a> [JURIST report] the UK's Secret Intelligence Service known as MI6, alleging that the agency accesses data from undersea cables in violation of the rights to private life and freedom of expression.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A southern China court on Monday sentenced three prominent labor organizers to suspended prison terms, almost nine months after they were arrested during a crackdown on civic organizations working outside of the Communist Party. Zeng Feiyang, who was indicted on claims of "gathering a crowd to disturb social order" was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/world/asia/china-labor-activists-guangdong-sentenced.html">sentenced</a> [NYT report] to three years with a four-year suspension, while the two other organizers, Tang Jian and Zhu Xiaomei, were sentenced to one-and-a-half years with two-year suspensions. The three activists were important figures in the labor movement in China, effective at organizing workers to fight for higher wages and better working conditions. Recent downturn in China's economy and labor shortages have led to a crackdown by the government on such activities. While the activists will not immediately serve prison terms and their sentences have been called <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-labour-idUSKCN11W1DS">"a relatively good result"</a> [Reuters report] by human rights lawyer Chen Xuejin, the suspended sentences will make it difficult for the three men to continue with their labor work.</p>

<p>China's human rights record has drawn international scrutiny. Last week a Chinese court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/china-human-rights-lawyer-sentenced-to-12-years.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] noted human rights lawyer Xia Lin to 12 years in prison. In July China announced plans to <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/china-to-prosecute-eminent-human-rights-lawyer.php">prosecute</a> [JURIST report] prominent human rights lawyer Zhou Shifeng on charges of subverting state power, furthering its recent crackdown on political dissidents. In April a civil rights lawyer was <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/china-lawyer-detained-for-post-mocking-president-xi-jinping-over-panama-papers.php">arrested and released</a> [JURIST report] for posting an image online mocking Xi in relation to the Panama Papers release. In January Chinese authorities <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/prominent-china-human-rights-attorney-arrested-for-political-subversion.php">arrested</a> [JURIST report] high profile human rights lawyer Wang Yu and her husband on charges of political subversion.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Spanish court began hearing the fraud trial of former <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) [official website] chief Rodrigo Rato and more than 60 other bankers on Monday concerning allegations the defendants fraudulently used secret credit cards from Bankia bank to pay for personal luxuries. Rato also served as economic minister of Spain, was a member of the Popular Party and headed Bankia until it nearly collapsed in 2012. Prosecutors <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37470509">claim</a> [BBC report] the defendants spent about USD $13.5 million of bank funds on travel, hotels, and entertainment and also failed to report any of the expenses to tax authorities. Prosecutors are seeking a <a href="https://noticias.terra.es/espana/rodrigo-rato-se-enfrenta-hoy-a-juicio-por-el-uso-de-tarjetas-opacas-al-fisco,373f0fa2f6bd9f3700d392947e2aec7blv7okrmk.html">sentence</a> [<em>Terra España</em> report, in Spanish] of up to four years for Rato, while Bankia is requesting that he receive a penalty of six years. The prosecution is also requesting that Rato make restitution payments to Bankia. Officials <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/spanish-court-open-case-against-officials-of-nationalized-bank.php">began investigations</a> [JURIST report] into fraud in 2012, shortly after Bankia requested a government bailout in the amount of USD $24 billion to help lift itself out of financial crisis.</p>

<p>This is the latest of several high-profile corruption cases to come out of Spain in recent years. Last year a Spanish High Court judge <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/spain-judge-orders-trial-for-former-ruling-party-treasurers-in-graft-scandal.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] 40 people, including three former ruling party treasurers, to stand trial over a bribes-for-contracts scheme. The scandal is thought to have extended to six regional Popular Party governments between 1999 and 2009, and individuals involved are thought to have taken bribes and rerouted public money in exchange for public contracts. In 2013 the Spanish Provincial Court of Malaga <a href="/paperchase/2013/10/spain-court-convicts-53-in-corruption-trial.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] 53 people for money laundering, bribery and fraud, while 42 people were acquitted. The trial, referred to as the Malaya case, was Spain's largest ever corruption trial after a total of 199 court sessions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] UN human rights expert <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Women/SRWomen/Pages/DubravkaSimonovic.aspx">Dubravka Šimonović</a> [official profile] <a href="http://ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20584&LangID=E">called</a> [press release] Monday for women to participate in a new peace process between Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). Šimonović suggested that reducing violence against women and supporting gender equality will assist in achieving peace in the region. Her comments were made at the end of her first official visit to Israel and the OPT, which spanned nearly two weeks and was intended to investigate violence against women:<blockquote>My visit takes place after a long absence of any other UN Special Rapporteur visits and I hope that this translates the willingness of both governments to strengthen their efforts to eliminate violence against women and to uphold women's rights in public and private sphere in line with their international human rights obligations and commitments.</blockquote> Groups of women in Israel, including refugees and women from minority communities, face multiple forms of discrimination, and the "prolonged occupation" has had a particular impact on females in relation to "embedded patriarchal social norms." Šimonović will present her final report and recommendation to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Pages/Home.aspx">UN Human Rights Council</a> [official website] in June.</p>

<p>The violence in the ongoing <a href="https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/israel/palestine">Israel-Palestinian conflict</a> [HRW backgrounder] has created contentious legal and human rights situations. In July Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-palestine-and-israel-officials-need-to-deal-with-war-crimes.php">called upon Palestinian and Israeli officials</a> [JURIST report] to address human rights violations committed by their forces. The UN Committee Against Torture, a body of independent experts, <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/un-rights-group-finds-excessive-force-by-israel.php">released closing remarks</a> [JURIST report] to its fifty-seventh session in May, expressing concern about the use of excessive force by Israeli forces against Palestinians. An Israeli court in April <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/israel-man-convicted-of-2014-murder-of-palestinian-teenager-that-sparked-conflict.php">convicted</a> [JURIST report] Yosef Haim for the 2014 murder of a Palestinian teenager that led to the 50-day war in Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/CountriesMandates/PS/Pages/MakarimWibisono.aspx">Makarim Wibisono</a> [official profile] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-rights-expert-resigns-over-denial-of-access-to-occupied-palestinian-territory.php">resigned</a> [JURIST report] from his position in January, saying that Israel has not granted him access to the OPT after repeated requests.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/29687cc7-26d9-42b6-9d76-60d9cd86cf3d/1/doc/15-1672_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/29687cc7-26d9-42b6-9d76-60d9cd86cf3d/1/hilite/">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Monday that <a href="http://about.americanexpress.com/?inav=footer_about_american_express">American Express</a> (Amex) [corporate website] can enforce rules that ban merchants accepting its credit cards from directing customers to its competitors' cards. The court reversed a lower court's determination that Amex's agreements with merchants impermissibly restrained trade in violation of antitrust laws. The court held:<blockquote>We conclude that, so long as Amex's market share is derived from cardholder satisfaction, there is no reason to intervene and disturb the present functioning of the payment‐card industry. Whatever market power Amex has appears, on this record, to be based on its rewards programs and perceived prestige, i.e., Amex cardholders regard the card as cheaper than competing Visa and MasterCard cards. The [nondiscriminatory provisions] (NDPs) protect that program and that prestige.  Outlawing the NDPs would appear to reduce this protection&#8212;and likely with the result of increasing the market shares of Visa and MasterCard.</blockquote>The Second Circuit directed that judgment be entered in favor of Amex.</p>

<p>There have been several high-profile cases involving credit card companies in the last several years. In April 2014 a judge for the <a href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/index.php">US District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2014/04/district-court-judge-dismisses-lawsuit-against-credit-card-issuers.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] a class action lawsuit against Amex, <a href="http://www.citigroup.com/citi/">Citigroup</a> and <a href="https://www.discover.com/">Discover Financial Services</a> [corporate websites] that alleged the three credit card issuers violated the Sherman Act by colluding to require that all disputes be settled in arbitration. The plaintiffs in the case were seeking injunctive relief to prohibit these credit card issuers from putting such arbitration clauses in their agreements. In August 2014 a judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York approved a <a href="/paperchase/2013/08/federal-judge-approves-590-million-citigroup-investor-lawsuit.php#.U0gSOMfTavM">settlement</a> [JURIST report] in which Citigroup will pay its investors over $590 million for misrepresenting its assets in securities linked to the <a href="/jurist_search.php?q=Sub-prime">sub-prime mortgage crisis</a> [JURIST news archive]. In June 2014 the US Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2013/06/supreme-court-upholds-contractual-waiver-of-class-arbitration.php#.U0gRJ8fTavM">ruled</a> [JURIST report] in <span class="casename">American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant</span> that the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/9#">Federal Arbitration Act</a> [text] does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiff's cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</a> [official website] on Monday reported an increase in violent crime during 2015 and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2015-crime-statistics">decrease in property crimes</a> [press release]. <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/home">Crime in the United States, 2015</a> [report materials] revealed the first increase in violent crime in recent years, although property crimes have been declining each year for over a decade. While the report showed a 3.9 percent rise in violent crime from 2014, the totals for 2015 were lower than 2011 by 0.7 percent, and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/latest-crime-statistics-released">lower than 2006 by 16.5 percent</a> [FBI report]. Included in the report was a <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/resource-pages/messagefromthedirector_final">message</a> [text] from <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/about/leadership-and-structure/fbi-executives">FBI Director James Comey</a> [official profile] highlighting the necessity of accurate crime statistics:<blockquote>We need more transparency and accountability in law enforcement. We also need better, more informed conversations about crime and policing in this country. To get there, we are improving the way this nation collects, analyzes, and uses crime statistics and data about law enforcement's use of force. Information that is accurate, reliable, complete, and timely will help all of us learn where we have problems and how to get better.</blockquote>The report also unveiled that crime was almost twice as high in the southern US than in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-fbi-idUSKCN11W0AY">other regions</a> [Reuters report].</p>

<p>The report was released amid a national conversation about police use of force, as well as conversations about hate crimes in general. Last week the US <a href="https://www.justice.gov/">Department of Justice</a> (DOJ) [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/doj-to-investigate-tulsa-police-shooting-of-unarmed-black-man.php">opened an investigation</a> [JURIST report] into the fatal police shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man who was shot the previous week by a Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer. A new report compiled by <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">California State University, San Bernardino</a> [official website] and released earlier this month found an <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/research-finds-highest-increase-in-anti-muslim-hate-crimes-since-911.php">increase in hate crimes</a> [JURIST report] in 2015, particularly against Muslims and Arab-Americans. In May Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law an <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-expanding-hate-crime-statute-to-police-ems-workers-firefig.php">amended hate crimes bill</a> [JURIST report], referred to as the "Blue Lives Matter" law, including police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/en/index.php">National Assembly of Pakistan</a> [official website] on Monday approved a <a href="http://www.na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1474902799_197.pdf">bill</a> [PDF] that allows the Hindu community to legally register their marriages. Rights groups <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pakistani-lawmakers-adopt-landmark-Hindu-marriage-bill/articleshow/54545116.cms">applauded</a> [Times of India report] the passing of the Hindu marriage bill as it will lead to greater protection for female members of the minority Hindu community who will now be able to provide proof of marriage. The bill sets the minimum age for marriage for Hindus at 18. It also grants Hindus the right to divorce, with women having the additional right to do so on grounds of negligence, bigamy or having been married before the age of 18. In February the Pakistani province of Sindh became the <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/pakistani-province-becomes-first-to-legalize-hindu-marriage.php">first province to legalize Hindu marriage</a> [JURIST report] under the marriage registry in the nation. The nation-wide bill will now proceed to the Senate for approval. </p>

<p>Pakistan has been under pressure to improve human rights conditions for years. Also in September Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/hrw-pakistan-must-overhaul-its-police-force.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] that looks at the history of the Pakistani police and details occurrences of arbitrary arrest, torture, extra-judicial killings and sexual violence, especially among religious minorities that are especially vulnerable. Last week HRW called on Pakistani authorities to <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/hrw-urges-pakistan-not-to-execute-man-with-intellectual-disability.php">halt the execution of a mentally disabled man</a> [JURIST report], saying "executing people with mental health conditions is an affront to decency and serves no criminal justice purpose." Earlier this month a <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/kashmir-authorities-re-arrest-human-rights-activist.php">human rights lawyer was re-arrested in Kashmir</a> [JURIST report] on the grounds of a controversial security law which allows the detention of suspects for up to six months without a trial. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) signed a <a href="https://www.mesadeconversaciones.com.co/sites/default/files/24_08_2016acuerdofinalfinalfinal-1472094587.pdf">peace agreement</a> [text, in Spanish] on Monday that ends a more than 50-year conflict. The agreement was <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/colombia-and-farc-rebels-finalize-peace-agreement.php">finalized</a> [JURIST report] in August after four years of negotiations in Havana, Cuba. Witnesses to the signing included UN secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, US secretary of state John Kerry, as well as hundreds of victims of the war. Under the accord, FARC has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/27/colombia-farc-peace-deal-resounds-homeland-uribe">vowed</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] to sever all ties with the drug trade, hand over all its weapons and convert into a political party. A special tribunal will try war-related crimes, but those who confess to crimes against humanity will serve alternative sentences that do not involve jail time. Rodrigo Londoño, also known as Timoshenko, said, "[o]ur only weapons will be our words. In the name of the Farc I ask sincere forgiveness to all the victims of the conflict and for all the pain we may have caused in this war[.]" Colombian citizens will vote on Sunday whether to approve the deal.</p>

<p>The peace agreement seeks to end more than half a decade of conflict in the South American country that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/24/americas/farc-colombia-final-peace-deal/">claimed</a> [CNN report] more than 220,000 people and displaced countless others. In June the Colombian government and FARC <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/colombia-and-farc-agree-to-bilateral-ceasefire.php">signed</a> [JURIST report] a ceasefire as the revolutionary forces transition to a peaceful political party. In January the UN Security Council unanimously <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/un-security-council-approves-peace-mission-in-colombia.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a resolution authorizing the creation of a political peace mission in Colombia to monitor the disarmament between the Colombian government and FARC rebels. In November Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/colombia-president-pardons-30-farc-guerrilla-soldiers.php">pardoned</a> [JURIST report] 30 former guerrilla soldiers in jail for non-violent and minor crimes. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.pf.gov.br/">Federal Police of Brazil</a> [official website, in Portuguese] on Monday <a href="http://www.pf.gov.br/agencia/noticias/2016/09/pf-investiga-ex-ministro-da-casa-civil-e-da-fazenda">arrested</a> [press release, in Portuguese] former finance minister Antonio Palocci in connection with an ongoing corruption probe. The former minister is accused of being involved with a host of other government officials who worked under the administrations of former presidents <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-10841416">Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11446466">Dilma Rousseff</a> [BBC profile] and illegally conspired with the local company <a href="http://www.odebrecht.com/en/odebrecht-group">Odebrecht group</a> to engage in deceitful business practices with the oil giant <a href="http://www.petrobras.com/en/home.htm">Petrobras</a> [corporate websites]. The ongoing probe, entitled <a href="http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/tag/lava-jato/">Operation Lava Jato</a> [Rio Times backgrounder], is in its 35th phase with the execution of the warrant.</p>

<p>Last week the Brazil Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/brazil-supreme-court-allows-corruption-probe-of-president-temer.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a motion by prosecutors to open a preliminary investigation into accusations from Sergio Machado, former Transpetro head, that current President Michel Temer sought illegal campaign donations in 2012.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/investor-relations/">Wells Fargo</a> [corporate website] shareholders on Monday <a href="http://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-wellsfargo.html">filed</a> [press release] suit against the banking conglomerate over their allegedly deceptive sales practices. The <a href="http://www.rgrdlaw.com/media/cases/399_Wells%20Fargo%20cpt.pdf">suit</a> [complaint, PDF], filed in the <a href="https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/home">US District Court for the Northern District of California</a> [official website], alleges that the Wells Fargo organization violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by engaging in misleading and incorrect information regarding the financial status of the bank. The shareholders argue that this misinformation caused the stock of the banking giant to trade at an inflated rate causing undue financial harm to them. The shareholders further argue Wells Fargo recouped millions in profit after misleading consumers and the public by creating false cross-selling techniques to make the company more profitable.<blockquote>While bragging about the Company's cross-selling prowess, defendants knew but deliberately failed to disclose known material true facts, including that the Company's cross-selling strategy was not focused on or designed to benefit customers, but was instead designed to fulfill sales quotas or otherwise advances the interest of Wells Fargo or its employees and ind increase sources of profitability, while simultaneously burdening customers with financial products they did not authorize, need and/r even know about. In fact, defendants knew  the Company;s cross-sell strategy that they oversaw was fueled by a sales culture designed by Wells Fargo management that incentivized and rewarded employees for pushing products on customers in order to show growth without regard for the impact on customers.</blockquote>Two former employees of Wells Fargo <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/former-wells-fargo-employees-file-lawsuit-against-bank.php">filed</a> a class action lawsuit  on Thursday on behalf of employees whom they claim were penalized over the last 10 years for following the rules and not meeting sales quotas. A class action lawsuit was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/wells-fargo-customers-file-suit-against-the-bank-for-fraudulent-accounts.php">filed</a> [JURIST report] earlier this month in a US District Court in Utah against Wells Fargo by customers alleging invasion of privacy, fraud, negligence and breach of contract. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a federal agency entrusted with consumer protection in the financial sector, <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/consumer-agency-fines-wells-fargo-us-100-million.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] in September a $100 million fine against banking giant Wells Fargo [corporate website] for widespread illegal sales practices.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/">International Criminal Court</a> (ICC) [official website] on Tuesday <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/CourtRecords/CR2016_07244.PDF">sentenced</a> [judgment, PDF] a Malian jihadist to nine years of imprisonment for overseeing the destruction of Muslim shrines in Timbuktu, Mali. <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf">Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi</a> [case information, PDF] <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/malian-jihadist-pleads-guilty-to-destroying-timbuktu-shrines-at-start-of-icc-trial.php">admitted his guilt</a> [JURIST report] when his trial began in August. This is a historic case, marking the first time the ICC has tried and convicted someone for committing the war crime of demolishing religious buildings and historical monuments. In determining a nine-year sentence, the court acknowledged that while crimes against property are grave, they are not as grave as crimes against persons. However, the destroyed shrines had been <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/">UNESCO World Heritage</a> [official website] sites, and the mosques and mausoleums of saints were fundamental parts of the religious life of the Mali community and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The danger to world heritage sites and other important landmarks in Mali is not the only concern among the international community regarding the country. Mali has been facing a humanitarian crisis since 2012 that has raised graver international concerns. In May 2012 <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] released a report saying that Mali was facing its <a href="g/paperchase/2012/05/mali-facing-human-rights-crisis-amnesty.php">worst human rights crisis</a> [JURIST report] since it gained independence in 1960. Human Rights Watch released a similar report in April 2012 claiming that all sides to the conflict are <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/all-sides-in-mali-conflict-have-committed-war-crimes-hrw.php">committing war crimes</a> [JURIST report]. Earlier in April the ICC said they would <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/icc-closely-monitoringsituation-in-mali.php">monitor the situation</a> [JURIST report] in Mali for potential crimes under the ICC's jurisdiction. The turmoil began when Taureg rebels <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/01/20121182151622785.html">attacked Malian soldiers</a> [Al Jazeera report]. Many in the international community <a href="/paperchase/2012/04/un-rights-expert-concerned-with-ongoing-violence-refugee-safety-in-mali.php">expressed concern</a> [JURIST report] over the situation, including <a href="https://www.un.org/sg/en">UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon</a> [official website], then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> [official website]. All of this came after Malian soldiers <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/mali-soldiers-take-control-of-government-suspend-constitution.php">took control of the government</a> [JURIST report] and suspended the constitution in March 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A judge for the <a href="http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/Default.aspx">US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/IL%20election.pdf">granted</a> [opinion, PDF] a motion on Tuesday blocking Illinois from allowing voter registration on Election Day in the state's most populated counties. The state's same-day voter registration program was implemented in 2015 and offered to counties with populations over 100,000. The Chicago-based <a href="http://libertyjusticecenter.org/">Liberty Justice Center</a> [advocacy website], filed the lawsuit to halt the program, claiming it gave an unfair advantage to Democratic candidates, who are traditionally populated in urban, highly-populated counties. The court <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-illinois-idUSKCN11X2C6">ruled</a> [Reuters report] that if Illinois wants to have a same-day voter registration program, it must be state-wide to be fair. "The application of this legislation favors the urban citizen and dilutes the vote of the rural citizen," Judge Samuel Der-Teghiayan wrote in the opinion. "The Supreme Court has made it clear that legislation cannot 'restrict the political participation of some in order to enhance the relative influence of others.'" The ruling placed an injunction on the program, and if the injunction is not lifted, then the latest that Illinois voters could register online for the presidential election is October 23.</p>

<p>Voting issues have become especially contentious as the presidential election approaches. Last week the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-ohio-purging-of-inactive-voters-from-rolls.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a procedure implemented by the Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted that effectively eliminated inactive voters from registration rolls if they failed to respond to letters requesting confirmation of their status and addresses. Earlier this month the Missouri legislature <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/missouri-legislature-overrides-veto-on-voter-id-and-gun-laws.php">overrode</a> [JURIST report] vetoes by Governor Jay Nixon to approve two bills, one requiring voter ID and the other removing the need to renew permits in order to carry a concealed weapon. Last month an Oklahoma court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/voting-begins-in-oklahoma-after-voter-id-law-upheld.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report] a controversial voter ID law allowing the law to be in place while early voting commenced for a primary run-off. In July voter restrictions were overturned in <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/supreme-court-declines-to-reinstate-north-carolina-voter-id-law.php">North Carolina</a>, <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/judge-orders-kansas-to-count-thousands-of-disputed-votes.php">Kansas</a> and <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-rules-wisconsin-election-laws-unconstitutional.php">Wisconsin</a> [JURIST reports].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/en/">Greek Parliament</a> [website] approved new legislation Tuesday cutting pensions and increasing the rate of privatization. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/business/international/greek-lawmakers-pass-additional-austerity-measures.html?_r=0">measures</a> [NYT report] were taken in order to satiate creditors and receive aid under the country's third bail-out procedure. Included in the deal was a transfer of electricity and water utilities. Passed by a narrow majority, the legislation was <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-reforms-idINKCN11X288">met with protests by workers</a> [Reuters report], largely by those employed by the nation's water providers. The purpose of the package is to further decrease the nation's tremendous debt and to maintain employment rates. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216">debt crisis</a> [BBC timeline] in Greece began in 2009 with a down-grade of a credit rating, and in the following years, has led Greece to borrow hundreds of billions of euros. In May the Greek Parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/greece-lawmakers-approve-austerity-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] the last round of austerity measures necessary to secure European bailout funds. The nation <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/greek-parliament-approves-reform-bill-to-aid-victims-of-austerity-measures.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill in February that provides health insurance and municipality jobs to poor Greek citizens affected by the country's recent austerity measures. Last October Greek lawmakers <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/greece-lawmakers-approve-new-austerity-bill.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a bill containing new austerity measures and economic overhauls under its new bailout program. In April of last year the European Central Bank <a href="/paperchase/2015/04/euro-bank-identifies-risks-in-greece-anti-foreclosure-law.php">expressed concerns</a> [JURIST report] about Greece's draft law that prohibits the government from foreclosing on primary residences where borrowers can prove total wealth requirements as ripe for unscrupulous debtors to engage in strategic defaults without repercussions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/KateGilmore.aspx">Kate Gilmore</a> [official profile] <a href="http://unsmil.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?tabid=5662&ctl=Details&mid=6187&ItemID=2099737&language=en-US">addressed</a> [text] the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session33/Pages/33RegularSession.aspx">33rd session of the Human Rights Council</a> [website] on Tuesday speaking on the deteriorating human rights situation in Libya and calling for accountability and reform. She described the ability of armed groups to terrorize the nation by kidnapping, torturing and killing civilians based on political or familial affiliations. She noted that human rights advocates and media professionals face similar dangers. She claimed some of these groups have state ties, which pay them and enable them to carry out law-enforcement duties. Gilmore continued to highlight abuses by alleging the inhuman treatment of migrants. She urged the council to consider the "establishment of a special procedures mandate of an independent expert on Libya, to report on the situation of human rights and on progress made towards accountability." </p>

<p>Libya has remained politically unstable since the <a href="/feature/featured/libya-conflict/">2011 deposition of Muammar Gaddafi</a> [JURIST backgrounder] and subsequent civil war. In May International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/icc-prosecutor-accountability-and-justice-critical-in-libya.php">told</a> [JURIST report] the UN Security Council that justice and accountability were crucial aspects of achieving and maintaining peace in the country. Also in May Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/hrw-islamic-state-has-executed-dozens-in-sirte-libya.php">reported</a> [JURIST report] that Islamic State militants had executed 49 people in the Libyan city of Sirte since seizing control in February 2015. The UN <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-report-libya-abuses-may-amount-to-war-crimes.php">released</a> [JURIST report] a report in February detailing a "litany of violations and abuses" being committed by both state and non-state actors in the Libyan conflict that could amount to war crimes. In January the internationally-recognized Libyan parliament <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/libya-parliament-rejects-unity-government.php">voted</a> [JURIST report] to reject a proposal by the then-UN-supported unity government to curb the country's political crisis.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Switzerland's lower house of Parliament on Tuesday narrowly approved a <a href="http://www.verhuellungsverbot.ch/darum-geht-es/">bill</a> [text, in German] that would amend the nation's federal constitution to include a ban on "concealing ones face" in public under most circumstances. Proposed by the <a href="http://www.verhuellungsverbot.ch/darum-geht-es/">Swiss People's Party</a>, the bill passed the <a href="http://www.verhuellungsverbot.ch/darum-geht-es/">National Council</a> [official websites] by an 88-87 vote, with 10 abstentions. Proponents of the bill argue that the ban does not impinge on freedoms and instead provides respect for women. Opponents counter, stating that the proposed law infringes on religious freedom and expression. The bill will next have to be approved by the <a href="http://www.verhuellungsverbot.ch/darum-geht-es/">Swiss Council of States</a> [official website], or by a national referendum, to become law. This is the second attempt at a burqa ban in Switzerland, with the first being voted down in January. </p>

<p>Swiss law has undergone a handful of notable adjustments in the recent past. Earlier this month, Swiss voters <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/switzerland-voters-approve-new-surveillance-law.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] a new surveillance law allowing their national intelligence service broad powers to spy on 'terrorist' suspects and cyber criminals, as well as the ability to cooperate with foreign intelligence agencies. In June Swiss voters <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/switzerland-voters-reject-universal-basic-income-plan.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a plan that would provide all citizens with a guaranteed basic income. The proposal called for all adults to be paid an unconditional monthly income, regardless of need. Finally in February the citizens of Switzerland <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/swiss-voters-reject-deportation-measure.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] a proposed referendum that would require immediate, automatic deportation of any foreign national who was convicted of two crimes within a 10-year period.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Four UN human rights experts on Tuesday <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20593&LangID=E">called on</a> [press release] Pakistan to halt the execution of Imdad Ali, a mentally disabled man that was convicted of murder in 2001. The experts called Imdad Ali's execution "unlawful and tantamount to an arbitrary execution, as well as a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment," and called for it to be annulled. Further, the UN requests a re-trial that would take into consideration his disability, and for Imdad Ali to be provided psychosocial treatment in the interim. </p>

<p>In addition to the UN, Human Rights Watch earlier this month <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/hrw-urges-pakistan-not-to-execute-man-with-intellectual-disability.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] Pakistan to stop Imdad Ali's execution, calling it "an affront to decency [that] serves no criminal justice purpose." More generally, <a href="/forum/2015/04/john-bessler-death-penalty.php">capital punishment</a> [JURIST op-ed] remains a controversial issue worldwide. Last month a UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-expert-condemns-iran-execution-of-12-drug-offenders.php">expressed "outrage"</a> [JURIST report] regarding Iran's execution of 12 people for drug-related charges. And in July Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-president-announces-support-of-reinstated-death-penalty.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] that he would approve reinstating the death penalty so long as the measure had sufficient support in the Grand National Assembly. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Obama administration announced Monday that is <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-loretta-e-lynch-and-secretary-interior-sally-jewell-announce-settlements">agreed</a> [press release] to <a href="http://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=3114864-Colorado-River-Joint-Stipulation-of-Settlement">pay</a> [settlement agreement] over $492 million to 17 Native American tribes. The lawsuits <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-pay-17-indian-tribes-492-million-to-settle-long-standing-disputes/2016/09/26/61d55e02-83fc-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html">accused</a> [WP report] the government of mismanaging natural resources and other tribal assets. According to the Obama administration, more than100 lawsuits were filed totaling more than $3.3 billion in damages against the federal government. The <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/27/495627997/u-s-government-to-pay-492-million-to-17-american-indian-tribes">US government is trustee</a> [NPR report] to a large portion of tribal land and manages almost 56 million acres on behalf of tribes. Under the trust agreement, the US government must ensure the tribe receives "just compensation for the use of their land and resources." According to the lawsuits, the government did not manage the land well and the tribes lost a lot of income. Since Obama has taken office, there have been almost 100 settlements with tribes.</p>

<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have become a pressing international legal topic in the past decade. In September a construction of a North Dakota pipeline was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-dakota-pipeline-construction-suspended-by-request-of-us-government.php">suspended</a> [JURIST report] due to its construction over sacred tribal land. A federal appeals court in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-appeals-court-allows-alaska-natives-to-place-land-in-federal-trust.php">rejected</a> [JURIST report] Alaska's challenge in a case determining the right of Alaskan tribes to place land in a federal trust. In May Canada's Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/canada-adopts-un-indigenous-rights-declaration.php">stated</a> [JURIST report] it would drop its objector status against the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In April JURIST Guest Columnist Dwight Newman of the University of Saskatchewan <a href="/forum/2016/04/Dwight-Newman-indigenous-rights.php">discussed</a> [JURIST op-ed] what is happening with recent leave decisions related to Indigenous rights and Canadian energy regulation. In March Canadian indigenous people, including Inuits of Nunavut and the Chippewa, were <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/inuit-appeal-seismic-testing-case-to-canadas-highest-court.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, challenging the use of seismic testing to find natural gas under the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay. In February experts from the UN and the Inter-American human rights systems <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/un-rights-experts-call-on-canada-to-address-violence-against-indigenous-women.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Canada to address the "root causes" of the extreme violence and discrimination against indigenous women and girls in that country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Norwegian court of appeals on Wednesday <a href="https://www.domstol.no/globalassets/upload/borg/internett/forside-nyheter/lagmannsrettens-kjennelse-280916---edward-joseph-snowden-2.pdf">rejected</a> [judgment, PDF, in Norwegian] a lawsuit against the country's government from <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-22837100">Edward Snowden</a> [BBC profile]. Snowden received a free-speech award from <a href="http://norskpen.no/nb_NO/">Norsk PEN</a>, the country's branch of <a href="http://www.pen-international.org/">PEN International</a> [official websites]. Snowden, having asylum in neighboring Russia, desired to travel to Oslo to accept the award, but filed suit against the nation's government seeking an advance decision on whether the country would extradite him to the US. The <a href="https://www.domstol.no/en/Enkelt-domstol/Borgarting-lagmannsrett/">Borgarting court</a> [official website, in Norwegian] followed the <a href="https://www.domstol.no/en/Enkelt-domstol/Oslo-District-Court/">Oslo district court</a> [official website, in Norwegian] in <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-snowden-norway-idUSKCN11Y10P">rejecting</a> [Reuters report] Snowden's claim, declining to compel the justice ministry to make such advance decisions. Norsk PEN, also involved in the lawsuit with Snowden, stated that they intend to appeal to the country's highest court.</p>

<p>Snowden, a former US <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) [official website] contractor and computer professional, became famous in 2013 for leaking classified information. His leak ultimately led to significant revelations about global mass surveillance programs employed by various governments, particularly the US. Earlier this month human rights groups, including the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> [advocacy websites], <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/rights-groups-urge-obama-to-pardon-snowden.php">called on</a> [JURIST report] US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barack Obama</a> [official profile] to pardon the former NSA contractor <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/leaving-edward-snowden-in-limbo-will-be-a-stain-on-president-obamas-legacy/">with the launch</a> [AI press release] of the <a href="https://pardonsnowden.org/">Pardon Snowden Campaign</a> [advocacy website]. Last October the European Parliament voted to <a href="/paperchase/2015/10/european-parliament-vote-to-protect-snowden-from-extradition.php">approve</a> [JURIST report] a resolution encouraging its member countries not to extradite Snowden and called upon its member states to drop all criminal charges against him and offer him protection as an "international human rights defender." The <a href="/forum/2013/07/tung-yin-edward-snowden.php">question of Snowden's guilt</a> [JURIST op-ed] and the legitimacy of the charges against him have been <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=5%2C4%2C6%2C&search=Snowden&limit=25&page=&author=&filtered=true&narrow=&authored=false">debated and analyzed</a> [JURIST news archive] widely in the U.S.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/Pages/default.aspx">National Credit Union Administration</a> (NCUA) [official website]  <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/newsroom/Pages/news-2016-sept-legal-recoveries-exceed-4-billion.aspx">said</a> [press release] Wednesday that the <a href="http://personal.rbs.co.uk/personal.html">Royal Bank of Scotland Group</a> (RBS) [corporate website] will pay $1.1 billion after it allegedly solid toxic mortgaged-backed securities. The RBS is currently <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-royal-bank-scot-lawsuit-idUSKCN11X2O8">preparing</a> [Reuters report] to settle a number of other US cases dealing with mis-selling similar bonds. This comes after the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Financial-Crisis-of-2008-The-1484264">2008 financial crisis</a> [Britannica backgrounder], in which the NCUA claim such firms "contributed to the corporate crisis." Under this settlement, the RBS does not admit fault as they currently are still facing 13 other cases for similar claims. The NCUA said that it continues to litigate against other bands for their sale of bad mortgage-backed securities to credit unions.</p>

<p>Major banking firms have faced numerous lawsuits regarding their business practices. In December 2013 the NCUA brought a <a href="/paperchase/2012/12/credit-union-agency-files-larges-suit-to-date-against-wall-street-firms.php">suit</a> [JURIST report] against JPMorgan for similar RMBS products sold by Bear Stearns, which was also subsequently purchased by JPMorgan. In July 2012 JPMorgan <a href="/paperchase/2012/07/jpmorgan-agrees-to-100-million-settlement-in-credit-card-case.php">agreed to a $100 million settlement</a> [JURIST report] in a suit brought by customers claiming unreasonable fees and a three percent increase on monthly minimum payments by credit card holders. In early June of that year the firm was <a href="/paperchase/2012/06/federal-judge-grants-preliminary-approval-for-jpmorgan-settlement.php">granted</a> [JURIST report] permission to pay $44.6 million to resolve allegations of fraudulent bidding practices for state and local government investment securities at taxpayers' expense. The settlement followed JPMorgan's <a href="/paperchase/2011/07/jpmorgan-chase-agrees-to-pay-$228-million-for-fraudulent-bidding-on-municipal-bonds.php">agreement</a> [JURIST report] with the US Department of Justice to pay $228 million to federal and state authorities. One month earlier JPMorgan again <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/jpmorgan-reaches-1536-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settled</a> [JURIST report] at $153.6 million for fraud charges brought by the SEC for misleading investors during the housing crises. In July 2010 Goldman Sachs agreed to a $550 million <a href="/paperchase/2010/07/goldman-sachs-reaches-record-550-million-settlement-with-sec.php">settlement</a> [JURIST report] with the SEC to resolve similar charges.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] on Wednesday released a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa39/4747/2016/en/">report</a> [text] detailing the prevalence of torture employed by Thai authorities and claiming the military government has <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/thailand-a-culture-of-torture-under-the-military/">led to a "culture of torture"</a> [AI report]. "Make Him Speak by Tomorrow," named after an apparently common order given to soldiers, is the product of a two-year investigation and details 74 cases of torture or other forms of ill-treatment implemented by Thai authorities. Although Thailand is a party to the <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CAT.aspx">UN Convention against Torture</a> [text], there are reportedly many aspects of the legal system that allow or incentivize the use of torture. Thailand is currently working on legislation that would criminalize torture, but AI's report also provides suggestions for how the government can resolve the major issues.<blockquote>These include ending unaccountable detention, criminalizing torture, banning the use of "evidence" obtained by torture and other ill-treatment, investigating reports of torture and bringing those responsible to justice, creating an independent monitoring body to carry out oversight of detention facilities, and providing remedies to victims.</blockquote>The report was set to be launched at a press conference in Bangkok on Wednesday, but Thai authorities <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/thailand-torture-victims-must-be-heard/">threatened AI representatives</a> [AI report] with arrest and prosecution if they went forward, prompting them to cancel the event.</p>

<p>Thailand has been home to significant human rights concerns for years, some of which stem from the nation's court system. In particular, human rights groups worldwide have expressed growing concern over violations in Thailand since the military junta came to power in May 2014. Earlier in September Thailand's military government <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailand-junta-to-stop-prosecuting-dissidents-in-military-courts.php">announced</a> [JURIST report] that it will prosecute cases concerning national security and "royal insult" in civilian courts, as opposed to military courts where the cases have been tried since 2014. Also in September the Thailand Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/thailands-top-court-sentences-protest-leader-to-20-years.php">affirmed</a> [JURIST report] a 20-year prison sentence given to protest leader Sondhi Limthongkul in 2012. Last month Thailand <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/thailand-passes-new-constitution-via-referendum.php">passed a new constitution</a> [JURIST report] by referendum vote. The constitution was drafted by a military-appointed counsel and is feared to be another step in entrenching military control of the nation. Thai military officials in July <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/three-human-rights-defenders-charged-in-thailand-over-report-on-torture.php">charged</a> [JURIST report] three human rights defenders with criminal defamation and violations of the Computer Crimes Act because of a report they published detailing acts of torture in Thailand. In April Human Rights Watch <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/thailand-urged-to-revoke-military-police-powers.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] Thailand to stop harassing and charging human right lawyers for defending victims of the government's abuses, and to revoke military police powers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Israel's <a href="http://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/home/index.html">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Wednesday unanimously rejected an appeal by former prime minister Ehud Olmert attempting to shorten his sentence for accepting bribes. The court, taking into account both the severity of the sentence and the conviction, <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/sites/almonitor/contents/afp/2016/09/israel-politics-olmert-court.html">upheld</a> [Al-Monitor report] Olmert's sentence but also rejected an appeal from the prosecution appealing Olmert's acquittal in another matter as well as a <a href="http://www.jta.org/2016/09/28/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/ehud-olmert-loses-supreme-court-appeal-in-talansky-affair">call for a harsher sentence</a> [JTA report]. The ruling means that Olmert will serve a total of 27 months in prison.</p>

<p>Earlier this year an Israeli court <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/israel-court-extends-prison-sentence-for-former-pm.php">extended</a> [JURIST report] Olmert's 18-month jail sentence by one month. Olmert was sentenced to serve five months for obstruction of justice concurrently with the sentence for bribery charges and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35541000">one additional month consecutively</a> [BBC report], totaling 27 months. Olmert was convicted in March 2014 and <a href="/paperchase/2014/05/former-israel-pm-sentenced-to-six-years-in-prison-for-bribery.php">sentenced</a> [JURIST report] to six years imprisonment on several charges dealing with bribery. His sentence was <a href="/paperchase/2014/09/israel-supreme-court-postpones-former-pms-prison-sentence.php">postponed</a> [JURIST report] pending the appeal of his conviction. Olmert was accused of accepting money to promote a real-estate project in Jerusalem when he was mayor and the country's trade minister. He was forced to resign in 2009 amid the bribery charges, but has always denied any wrongdoing on his part.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] Turkish <a href="http://www.justice.gov.tr">Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag</a> [official official, in Turkish] <a href="http://www.ntv.com.tr/turkiye/bozdag-adil-oksuz-mit-ajani-degil-bu-bir-propaganda,Kh9-90jumUyiYojAXFAy1w?_ref=infinite">said</a> [NTV report] Wednesday that approximately 32,000 people have been arrested in relation to the recent coup attempt, and 70,000 have been questioned. Bozdag indicated the country will have to build more courts in order to try those accused in the coup attempt. Construction has already begun on a <a href="http://news.trust.org/item/20160928094936-cj4gb/">new courthouse</a> [Reuters report] near Ankara. The Justice Minister also noted that the US is expected to cooperate with the extradition of Pennsylvania-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. </p>

<p>The aftermath of the failed coup attempt continues as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/turkish-authorities-detain-thousands-over-attempted-coup.php">vowed</a> [JURIST report] that those involved in the coup would "pay a heavy price." Last month a group of human rights experts for the <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-experts-urge-turkey-to-maintain-human-rights-despite-state-of-emergency.php">UN called upon</a> [JURIST report] Turkey's government to uphold its international human rights obligations, despite declared emergency following failed coup. Also last month an Istanbul court <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/turkish-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-us-based-fetullah-gulen-over-coup.php">issued an arrest warrant</a> [JURIST report] for Gullen on charges of orchestrating the attempted coup. Also last month Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjørn Jagland <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/top-eu-rights-official-urges-turkey-to-respect-rule-of-law.php">traveled</a> [JURIST report] toTurkey to meet with a variety of Turkish officials to urge for respect for the rule of law. In July Amnesty International <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/amnesty-turkish-government-attacking-press-freedom-in-coup-aftermath.php">condemned</a> [JURIST report] Turkey's decision to issue arrest warrants for 42 journalists.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The US <a href="https://www.congress.gov/">Congress</a> [official website] on Wednesday overrode US <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/president-obama">President Barrack Obama's</a> [official website] veto of a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. Obama <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/obama-vetoes-911-bill-allowing-suit-against-saudi-arabia.php">vetoed</a> [JURIST report] the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2040">Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act</a> (JASTA) [text] last Friday, stating that such a bill violates international standards of foreign sovereign immunity and may set a dangerous precedent for allowing the US to be held liable by foreign private courts. Obama has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/senate-obama-veto-september-11-bill-saudi-arabia">stated</a> [<em>Guardian</em> report] that, though voting against the bill may appear to be a vote against 9/11 families, the decision is necessary to uphold US national interests. Nevertheless Congress voted overwhelmingly against Obama's veto, with the Senate voting 97-1 and the House voting 348-77. Supporters of the bill have argued that such a bill gives terrorist victims their day in court and only holds sovereign nations  liable should they have any responsibility for a terrorist attack inside US borders. This is the first veto overridden during Obama's presidency. Obama and White House representatives responded to the decision with disappointment.</p>

<p>The White House Press Secretary Paul Earnest <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/white-house-says-obama-will-veto-911-victims-bill.php">announced</a> earlier this month that Obama intended to veto the bill, shortly after the bill was <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/us-house-approves-bill-allowing-911-families-to-sue-saudi-arabia.php">approved</a> [JURIST reports] by the US House of Representatives. The Act was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/us-senate-approves-bill-allowing-saudi-arabia-to-be-sued-for-911-attacks.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Senate in May. In 2012 a US District judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-dismisses-motion-to-reinstate-saudi-arabia-as-911-defendant.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Saudi Arabia as a defendant in a civil compensation lawsuit by victims against the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim against Saudi Arabia was dismissed in 2008 by a US Appeals Court due to insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes has actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the attacks. In 2005 Judge Richard Casey <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that all had <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/15-2021P-01A.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday against a New Hampshire law banning electronic devices in the ballot booth, making way for individuals to take "selfies" when voting. The court held that New Hampshire's <a href="https://www.nhliberty.org/bills/view/2014/HB366">HB 366</a> [materials], which prohibited individuals from making their marked ballots known to other individuals, is unconstitutional. The legislation later amended to state, "This prohibition shall include taking a digital image or photograph of his or her marked ballot and distributing or sharing the image via social media or by any other means." As a result, individuals were guilty of violating the bill if they took selfies while voting. The state argued the provision was to uphold the election process to prevent election intimidation. The appeals court held:<blockquote>Digital photography, the internet, and social media are not unknown quantities&#8212;they have been ubiquitous for several election cycles, without being shown to have the effect of furthering vote buying or voter intimidation. As the plaintiffs note, "small cameras" and digital photography "have been in use for at least 15 years," and New Hampshire cannot identify a single complaint of vote buying or intimidation related to a voter's publishing a photograph of a marked ballot during that period. Indeed, Secretary Gardner has admitted that New Hampshire has not received any complaints of vote buying or voter intimidation since at least 1976, nor has he pointed to any such incidents since the nineteenth century.</blockquote>The First Circuit's decision upholds a lower court ruling that had also struck down the ban on selfies.</p>

<p>As the election draws close, voting rights are becoming a contentious issue. A judge for the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois  <a href=/paperchase/2016/09/federal-court-blocks-election-day-voter-registrations-in-illinois.php">granted</a>  [JURIST report] a motion on Tuesday blocking Illinois from allowing voter registration on dlection day in the state's most populated counties. The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on Friday <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-ohio-purging-of-inactive-voters-from-rolls.php">struck down</a> [JURIST report] a procedure implemented by the Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted that effectively eliminated inactive voters from registration rolls if they failed to respond to letters requesting confirmation of their status and addresses. Advocacy groups last  Thursday <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/north-carolina-district-lines-challenged.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the redrawn boundaries for North Carolina's congressional seats. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=home&c=">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) [official website] on Thursday <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-167182">dismissed</a> [decision; <a href="http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press?i=003-5502553-6915399#{"itemid":["003-5502553-6915399"]}">press release</a>] the complaints of two individuals who were found liable for the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/omagh_bomb">1998 Omagh bombing</a> [BBC backgrounder]. The Belfast High Court had found that Liam Campbell and Real IRA leader Michael McKevitt were civilly liable for perpetuating the bombing. They appealed to the ECHR arguing that their trial was unfair because the court should have applied criminal, rather than civil standards of proof. At issue for the plaintiffs was their inability to cross examine FBI agents whose testimony was relayed to the court. The ECHR dismissed the complaint in a final, binding decision.</p>

<p>The fight to establish responsibility for the bombing has been ongoing. The Belfast High Court in 2008 <a href="/paperchase/2008/04/northern-ireland-starts-civil-trial-of.php">heard arguments</a> [JURIST report] in a civil lawsuit against five suspected Real IRA members accused of involvement in the deadly 1998 Omagh bombing, in which a car loaded with explosives killed 29 people and wounded 220 on a busy shopping street. In 2009 the Belfast High Court <a href="/paperchase/2009/06/real-ira-found-liable-in-northern.php">found</a> [JURIST report] four men, including McKevitt and Campbell, and the Real IRA responsible for the Omagh bombing in a civil case brought by victims' families. In 2010 the Irish Special Criminal Court <a href="/paperchase/2010/02/ireland-court-dismisses-case-against.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report the case against the only man criminally convicted for a role in the 1998 Omagh bombing, finding that the evidence against Colm Murphy was not strong enough to support the conviction</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The <a href="http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/">Supreme Court of India</a> [official website] ruled Wednesday that an Italian marine under investigation for murdering two Indian fishermen may stay in Italy pending a determination of where jurisdiction lies in the matter. Salvatore Girone, another marine involved in the 2012 incident, was allowed by the court to <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/india-top-court-frees-italian-marine-involved-in-killing-of-fishermen.php">return to Italy</a> [JURIST report] in May under similar circumstances. Massimiliano Latorre, the marine involved in Wednesday's ruling, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/09/28/world/asia/ap-as-italian-marines.html">returned</a> [NYT report] to Italy in 2014 seeking medical treatment following a stroke. The court has stated that the two marines must await a decision from the <a href="https://pca-cpa.org/en/home/">Permanent Court of Arbitration</a> [official website], which will determine what court has jurisdiction over an event that technically occurred in international waters. Though tensions have grown between Italy and India over the ongoing matter, the Italian foreign ministry praised the court's recent decision. </p>

<p>The "Enrica Lexie Incident" took place in 2012 when two Italian marines, Girone and Latorre, <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-fishermen-killing-italian-ship-enrica-lexie-sails-off-kerala-waters-1684893">shot and killed two Indian fishermen</a> [DNA India report], Ajesh Binki and Valentine, believing them to be pirates. The killing sparked international controversy and also created questions regarding jurisdiction. Last year the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea <a href="https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no.24_prov_meas/C24_Order_24.08.2015_orig_Eng.pdf">ordered India</a> [order, PDF] to <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/tribunal-orders-india-to-suspend-trial-of-italy-marines.php">suspend the trial</a> [JURIST report] of the two Italian marines. In July of last year the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-italy-marines-idUSKCN0PN1MK20150713">India Supreme Court heard</a> [Reuters report] a plea from Italy challenging India's jurisdiction. In 2012 Rome compensated the victims' families with $190,000, and the families dropped their cases against the marines, but the state did not follow suit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/courts/supreme-court/">Pennsylvania Supreme Court</a> [official website] <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-47A-2016mo%20-%2010282709712025453.pdf?cb=1">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Wednesday that indigent defendants may sue counties to ensure that public defenders' offices are more adequately funded. The case presented the issue of: "whether a cause of action exists entitling a class of indigent criminal defendants to allege prospective, systemic violations of the right to counsel due to underfunding, and to seek and obtain an injunction forcing a county to provide adequate funding to a public defender&#8217;s office." Justice David Wecht wrote the opinion and concluded that when:<blockquote>the level of funding provided by a county to operate a public defender's office has left that office incapable of complying with <a href="http://www.glencoe.com/sec/socialstudies/btt/celebratingfreedom/pdfs/305.pdf">Gideon</a> [opinion, PDF], creating the likelihood of a systematic, widespread constructive denial of counsel in contravention of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution [injunctive relief may be granted].</blockquote>The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.aclupa.org/news/2016/09/29/pa-supreme-court-rules-poor-defendants-have-right-challenge">called the decision</a> [press release] "critical to the ability of poor defendants to receive an effective legal defense."</p>

<p>The right to counsel at trial is constitutionally codified in the Sixth amendment and the duty for states to provide counsel to those who could not afford it themselves was established through Supreme Court precedent. While there are certain situations in the civil sector that <a href="/paperchase/2011/06/supreme-court-rules-that-indigent-defendants-do-not-have-right-to-counsel-in-civil-cases.php">do not require representation</a> [JURIST report] the right to counsel when a party may be imprisoned has long been held. In January the ACLU <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/aclu-files-lawsuit-over-public-defender-shortage-in-new-orleans.php">filed a class action lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the New Orleans Public Defenders Office and the Louisiana Public Defender Board due to the lack of available public defenders for individuals with no access to an attorney. The ACLU claims that as a result of the lack of state funding for public defenders, individuals are forced to wait months in jail without counsel or accept bail and plea negotiations which can have irreparable effects on their case. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>California Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=19566">signed</a> [press update] <a href="http://64.166.146.245/docs/2016/LEG/20160509_793/25474_AB%202466%20(Weber)%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf">legislation</a> [AB 2466 fact sheet, PDF] clarifying felons' voting rights. The law now clarifies that those sentenced under the third category of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB109">Criminal Justice Realignment Act</a> <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB117">of 2011</a> [AB 109 and 117]&#8212;a term in county jail&#8212;are not stripped of their constitutional right to vote and confirms that only those serving a state-prison sentence or on parole and under <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> [official website] supervision lose the right to vote. Bill sponsor Shirley Weber (D-San Diego) said the legislation is expected to ease the transition back to society and reduce recidivism. </p>

<p>Voting rights of convicted felons are a controversial issue. In June The Iowa Supreme Court <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/iowa-supreme-court-upholds-felon-voting-ban.php">upheld</a> [JURIST report]] a state law forbidding convicted felons from voting, even after serving their sentences. Also in June Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit challenging an executive order by Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/virginia-felon-voting-rights-challenged.php">restoring the voting rights of certain felons</a> [JURIST report]. In February the Maryland Senate overrode a veto by Governor Larry Hogan to pass a bill that will <a href="/paperchase/2016/02/maryland-senate-overrides-governor-veto-on-felon-voting-rights.php">allow felons to vote</a> [JURIST report] before they complete parole or probation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sudanese government used chemical weapons on civilians in a region of Darfur between January and September 9, an <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/">Amnesty International</a> (AI) [advocacy website] investigative report <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/09/sudan-credible-evidence-chemical-weapons-darfur-revealed/">claimed</a> [press release] Thursday. During this time, the Sudanese army engaged in a military offensive targeting the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid. AI believes that during this time 30 attacks occurred and more than 200 civilians died, including young children. The <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr54/4877/2016/en/">evidence</a> [materials] includes hundreds of interviews with survivors and satellite imagery. AI Director of Crisis Research, Tirana Hassan, said the military's use of chemical weapons is a war crime. She further stated: "Chemical weapons have been banned for decades in recognition of the fact that the level of suffering they cause can never be justified. The fact that Sudan's government is now repeatedly using them against their own people simply cannot be ignored and demands action." AI is urging the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/">UN Security Council</a> [official website] to investigate these attacks, prosecute anyone responsible and ensure the implementation of the current arms embargo. They also hope the UN Security Council can pressure Sudan to allow humanitarian access to the region.</p>

<p>The human rights situation throughout Sudan has drawn global condemnation. In March Human Rights Watch reported that <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/human-rights-watch-calls-on-sudan-to-protect-women-activist.php">female rights activists</a> [JURIST report] in Sudan are facing harassment, violence and other rights abuses. Earlier that month South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal upheld a lower court's ruling that the state broke the law by <a href="/paperchase/2016/03/south-africa-court-rejects-governments-appeal-over-failure-to-arrest-bashir.php">not detaining</a> [JURIST report] Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir despite an International Criminal Court order to do so. In February a UN human rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/rights-groups-urge-sudan-to-seek-justice-for-victims-of-violent-protest-in-khartoum.php">called for an end</a> [JURIST report] to conflict in Darfur between the Sudanese government and the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid, which may have led to human rights abuses and violations of international law.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A teen blogger in Singapore was sentenced to six weeks in jail on Thursday for "wounding religious feelings" after he pleaded guilty to posting comments on the Internet criticizing Christianity and Islam. The 17-year-old defendant, Amos Yee, told reporters he thought the sentence <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-teen-verdict-idUSKCN11Z0DW">was very fair</a> [Reuters report]. However, others have criticized the sentence as deterring freedom of expression. Last year Yee was also <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/singapore-releases-16-year-old-blogger-jailed-for-obscenity.php">jailed</a> [JURIST report] after posting images and video insulting the country's first prime minister, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-12975980">Lee Kuan Yew</a> [BBC backgrounder]. A UN rights expert <a href="/paperchase/2016/08/un-rights-expert-concerned-over-singapore-trial-of-teen-blogger.php">warned</a> [JURIST report] that Yee's trial was a sign of increased criminalization of expression in Singapore. </p>

<p>Singapore has a history of prosecuting those critical of the government. In March 2015 the Supreme Court of Singapore <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/singapore-top-court-fines-blogger-for-criticizing-same-sex-cases.php">fined blogger Alex Au</a> [JURIST report] for comments he made about an on-going challenge to the country's anti-homosexuality laws. Another court <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/singapore-court-orders-blogger-to-pay-pm-court-cost-in-defamation-suit.php">ordered blogger Roy Ngerng</a> [JURIST report] to pay Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for legal fees incurred pursuing a defamation case against Ngerng. In 2008 a Singapore court sentenced US <a href="/paperchase/2008/09/singapore-court-sentences-us-blogger-to.php">blogger and attorney Gopalan Nair</a> [JURIST report] to three months in jail for insulting a judge.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) on Thursday <a href="http://unama.unmissions.org/unama-condemns-killing-least-15-civilians-airstrike">condemned</a> [press release] an airstrike launched by unmanned aerial vehicle that struck a civilian home killing 15 and injuring 13, including one child. The airstrike, apparently targeting Islamic State (IS) militants, was conducted during the early morning hours of Thursday in the eastern district of Achin where civilians had gathered in a village to celebrate the return of a tribal leader from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. US Force-Afghanistan has thus far admitted conducting the airstrike and stated that they are in the process of investigating the incident internally before elaborating further. Expressing condolences to the families of those killed, UNAMA reiterated the need for all parties involved in the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law. UNAMA called on the government and international military forces to launch "a prompt, independent, impartial, transparent, and effective investigation into this incident."</p>

<p>The use of <a href="/feature/featured/drones/">drones</a> [JURIST backgrounder] is controversial in both the international arena and in domestic circles. In January the <a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> [official website] <a href="/paperchase/2016/01/federal-appeals-court-rules-national-security-council-records-not-subject-to-foia.php">ruled</a> [JURIST report] that the president's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc">National Security Council</a> (NSC) [official website] is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) [official website]. In November the Second Circuit ruled that the US government <a href="/paperchase/2015/11/drone-memos-may-stay-secret-federal-appeals-court.php">may keep secret memoranda</a> [JURIST report] related to the legal justification for the use of drones for targeted killings of those in other countries believed to be involved in terrorism. The case was the result of FOIA requests by the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> [media website] for documents prepared by the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc">Office of Legal Counsel of the US Department of Justice</a> [official website] regarding the drone strikes. In June 2015 the families of two Yemeni men killed by US drone strikes <a href="/paperchase/2015/06/yemen-drone-strike-victims-families-file-suit-against-us.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against the government, claiming they were wrongfully killed. In December 2010 a judge for the US District Court for the District of Columbia <a href="/paperchase/2010/12/federal-judge-dismisses-targeted-killing-lawsuit.php">dismissed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] challenging the Obama administration's ability to conduct <a href="/feature/2013/08/us-drones-abroad.php">targeted killings</a> [JURIST backgrounder], a challenge spurred because one subject of a targeted killing, al-Awlaki-Khan, was a dual US-Yemeni citizen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.sa/sites/mofaen/pages/default.aspx">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia</a> [official website] has <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.sa/sites/mofaen/ServicesAndInformation/news/MinistryNews/Pages/ArticleID201693001814440.aspx">condemned</a> [press release] the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/congress-overrides-veto-of-911-bill-allowing-suit-against-saudi-arabia.php">passage of the 9/11 bill</a> [JURIST report], called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2040/text">Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act</a> (JASTA) [bill, text], that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to fie civil suits for damages against the country. Pointing out that US' own top leaders, including <a href="https://www.barackobama.com/">President Barack Obama</a> [official website], the secretary of defense, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of the CIA, opposed JASTA in its current form, the Ministry stated that "the enactment of JASTA is of great concern to the community of nations that object to the erosion of the principle of sovereign immunity, which has governed international relations for hundreds of years." The Ministry also pointed out that JASTA has been publicly opposed by many nations around the world and American national security experts who have recognized the dangers that the bill represents. The Ministry expressed hope that Congress will take the necessary steps to reconsider the bill and correct it to avoid the serious unintended consequences that may ensue.</p>

<p>There has been great controversy concerning the passage of the 9/11 bill even within the US and Obama himself strongly criticized the congressional overriding of <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/obama-vetoes-911-bill-allowing-suit-against-saudi-arabia.php">his veto of the bill</a> [JURIST report]. In vetoing the bill last week, Obama expressed concern that JASTA may set a dangerous precedent for allowing the US to be held liable by foreign private courts. The White House Press Secretary Paul Earnest <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/white-house-says-obama-will-veto-911-victims-bill.php">announced</a> earlier this month that Obama intended to veto the bill, shortly after the <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/us-house-approves-bill-allowing-911-families-to-sue-saudi-arabia.php">bill was approved</a> [JURIST reports] by the US House of Representatives. The Act was <a href="/paperchase/2016/05/us-senate-approves-bill-allowing-saudi-arabia-to-be-sued-for-911-attacks.php">approved</a> [JURIST report] by the Senate in May. In 2012 a US District judge <a href="/paperchase/2012/03/federal-judge-dismisses-motion-to-reinstate-saudi-arabia-as-911-defendant.php">dismissed a motion</a> [JURIST report] to reinstate Saudi Arabia as a defendant in a civil compensation lawsuit by victims against the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The claim against Saudi Arabia was dismissed in 2008 by a US Appeals Court due to insufficient evidence that the Kingdom's princes has actual knowledge that their money was going to be used in the attacks. In 2005 Judge Richard Casey <a href="/paperchase/2005/01/federal-judge-dismisses-saudi-arabia.php">dismissed</a> [JURIST report] Saudi Arabia, its defense minister and its ambassador to the UK as defendants in litigation stemming from the terrorist attacks, ruling that <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereign_immunity">all had sovereign immunity</a> [Cornell LII backgrounder].</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://nvcourts.gov/supreme/">Supreme Court of Nevada</a> [official website] <a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Downloads/16-30308.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] Thursday that the funding provision of the state's <a href="https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/programs/nevada-education-savings-accounts/">Education Saving Account</a> (ESA) [official website] program is unconstitutional under the <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/const/nvconst.html">Nevada Constitution</a> [text]. In its opinion the court did not address the merit of the program as a whole, but effectively halted implementation until the financial issue can be resolved. The system would enable parents to access up to $5,000 in funds that would have otherwise been distributed to their child's public education, and put it toward private education and other academic expenses. The court took issue with the fact that the current plan for ESA funding was to draw money from resources allocated for public education and that the ESA did not have its own source separate from the amount budgeted for public education, nor was it included in that budget.</p>

<p>Education funding has led to numerous legal challenges across the US. Earlier this month the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that Governor Matt Bevin did not have the authority to unilaterally <a href="/paperchase/2016/09/kentucky-top-court-rules-governor-cannot-cut-state-university-budgets.php">cut the budget</a> [JURIST report] for state universities. In 2015 the Supreme Court of Washington <a href="/paperchase/2015/08/washington-supreme-court-fines-state-for-inadequate-school-funding.php">ordered</a> [JURIST report] the state to pay a fine of $100,000 per day for each day that it fails to comply with a previous court ruling mandating adequate funding of public schools. Also in August of that year the US Senate <a href="/paperchase/2015/07/senate-passes-bill-to-revamp-no-child-left-behind-act.php">passed a bill</a> [JURIST report] to revamp the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">Supreme Court</a> [official website] on Thursday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/092916zr_b97d.pdf">granted certiorari</a> [order list, PDF] in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/09/justices-add-eight-new-cases-to-docket-for-upcoming-term/">eight cases</a> [SCOTUSblog report] following its September 26 conference. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-827.htm">Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15-827-Petition-for-Certiorari.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine what level of educational benefit school districts must confer on children with disabilities to provide them with the free appropriate public education guaranteed by the <a href="https://www.disability.gov/individuals-disabilities-education-act-idea/">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> [official website]. The petitioner in the case is an autistic child whose parents' dissatisfaction with his education in a local public school prompted them to enroll him in a private school and seek reimbursement for the cost of tuition.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1248.htm">McLane Co. v. EEOC</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/32768-pdf-Dove.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine whether a district court's decision to quash or enforce an <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov//">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) [official website] subpoena should be reviewed de novo, which only the Ninth Circuit does, or should be reviewed deferentially, which eight other circuits do. The question arises from a gender discrimination charge filed with the EEOC against McLane, a national distribution company that argues that the more deferential standard should apply.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1256.htm">Nelson v. Colorado</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cert-petition-Nelson-v-Colorado.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine whether Colorado's requirement that defendants prove their innocence by clear and convincing evidence to get their money back, after reversal of conviction of a crime entailing various monetary penalties, is consistent with due process. The case concerns two Colorado residents convicted and sent to prison and ordered to pay restitution and a variety of fees. Their convictions were subsequently reversed on appeal and they unsuccessfully sought a refund of the money they had paid.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1293.htm">Lee v. Tam</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Petition-for-writ_Michelle-K.-Lee-Director-United-States-Patent-and-Trademark-Office-Petitioner-v.-Simon-Shiao-Tam.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine whether the disparagement provision of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1052">Lanham Act</a> [text], which provides that no trademark shall be refused registration on account of its nature unless, inter alia, it "[c]onsists of ... matter which may disparage ... persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute" is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The dispute arises in relation to the denied registration of a band name, and the case is expected to have implications for the <a href="/cgi-bin/mt/jurist-search.cgi?search=redskins&IncludeBlogs=2%2C5%2C4%2C6%2C21%2C15">Washington Redskins trademark dispute</a> [JURIST news archive].</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1391.htm">Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman</a> [docket; cert. petition, PDF] the court will determine, "whether state no-surcharge laws unconstitutionally restrict speech conveying price information (as the Eleventh Circuit has held), or regulate economic conduct (as the Second and Fifth Circuits have held)." The dispute arises because many merchants would prefer to describe the fees as surcharges to discourage their customers from using credit cards.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1406.htm">Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15-1406-Goodyear-v.-Haeger-Petition-For-A-Writ-Of-Certiorari-appendix-omitted....pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], consolidated with <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1491.htm">Musnuff v. Haeger</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/15-1491-cert-pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF], the court will determine whether a federal court is required to tailor compensatory civil sanctions imposed under inherent powers to harm directly caused by sanctionable misconduct when the court does not afford sanctioned parties the protections of criminal due process. The case arises from the imposition of sanctions against Goodyear and its attorney for alleged misconduct in a product liability case alleging that a defect in one of Goodyear's tires caused a car accident.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1498.htm">Lynch v. Dimaya</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-1498-Dimaya-Pet.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine if a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/16">provision</a> [text] of the Immigration and Nationality Act defining a crime of violence and governing an alien's removal from the US is unconstitutionally vague. In a similar case the court ruled in <a href="/paperchase/2016/04/supreme-court-clarifies-precedent-under-armed-career-criminal-act.php">Johnson v. United States</a> [JURIST report] that the so-called "residual clause" in the Armed Career Criminal Act's definition of "violent felony" was unconstitutionally vague.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/15-1500.htm">Lewis v. Clarke</a> [docket; <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/15-1500-Petition.pdf">cert. petition</a>, PDF] the court will determine the scope of sovereign immunity of a member of an Indian tribe for damages sought against tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment. The plaintiffs in the case, Brian and Michelle Lewis, were struck by a limousine driven by William Clarke, who was employed by an Indian tribe to drive casino patrons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] A federal judge on Thursday <a href="http://media.arkansasonline.com/news/documents/2016/09/29/document_2.pdf">issued a temporary injunction</a> [order, PDF] against Arkansas' suspension of Medicaid funding to <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-arizona">Planned Parenthood</a> [advocacy website]. Republican <a href="http://governor.arkansas.gov/governor-hutchinson">Governor Asa Hutchinson</a> [official profile] <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/29/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-planned-parenthood-defunding.html">terminated</a> [AP report] the Medicaid funding last year following national controversy ignited by video recordings of Planned Parenthood's practices. That same year, District Judge Kristine Baker forced the state to provide funding to three Medicaid patients who brought suit against the organization. In Thursday's ruling, Baker expanded the ruling to apply to all future Medicaid patients in the state. Baker found that such defunding irreparably harms patients by depriving them of their right to choose their family planning services provider. While Planned Parenthood praised the ruling, <a href="http://arkansasag.gov/meet-leslie/bio/">Attorney General Leslie Rutledge</a> [official profile] expressed her disappointment. Arkansas has already appealed the matter to the <a href="http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/">US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit</a> [official website] for further review. </p>

<p>There has been a recent slew of state laws attempting to cut back on women's access to abortion. In July the <a href="http://www.acluaz.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) [advocacy website] and Planned Parenthood <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/aclu-and-planned-parenthood-challenge-arizona-law-affecting-abortion.php">filed a lawsuit</a> [JURIST report] against an Arizona law that would potentially prevent low-income women from obtaining healthcare from their provider of choice. Earlier in July in a US district judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/federal-judge-blocks-florida-efforts-to-cut-planned-parenthood-funding.php">issued a preliminary injunction</a> [JURIST report] against a Florida law intended to cut state funding to clinics administering abortions. That same week a federal judge <a href="/paperchase/2016/07/indiana-federal-court-blocks-state-abortion-bill.php">placed an injunction</a> [JURIST report] on an Indiana law that would have banned women from seeking abortion procedures when they are based on race, sex, or the potential for or actual diagnosis of a disability in the fetus. Recently the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_p8k0.pdf">ruled</a> [opinion, PDF] 5-3 in <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/whole-womans-health-v-cole/">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a> [SCOTUSblog materials] that a Texas <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB2/2013/X2">law</a> [HB2 text] imposing certain requirements on abortion clinics and doctors creates an undue burden on access to abortion, and is therefore <a href="/paperchase/2016/06/supreme-court-rules-texas-abortion-law-creates-undue-burden.php">unconstitutional</a> [JURIST report]. A collection of Texas abortion providers challenged provisions of HB2 requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital and requiring abortion clinics to conform to state standards for ambulatory surgical centers on the grounds that such requirements violated the Fourteenth Amendment as interpreted by the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</a> [text]. The Indiana statute contained a similar "admitting privilege" provision.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[JURIST] The Kyrgyzstan <a href="http://www.kenesh.kg/">Supreme Council</a> [official website, in Kyrgyz] on Thursday voted in favor of holding a constitutional referendum that would give more power to the country's prime minister. Should the related parliamentary bill be <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyrgyzstan-politics-constitution-idUSKCN11Z1KC">passed</a> [Reuters report] in two more readings, the referendum will be held in December and introduce new constitutional provisions that expand the powers of cabinet and parliamentary leaders. Opponents of the bill have accused the referendum of being a plot to allow President Almazbek Atambayev to assume a prime minister position after his final term ends in 2017. Atambayev's <a href="http://www.sdpk.kg/">Social Democratic Party</a> [official website, in Kyrgyz] currently controls parliament's ruling coalition. </p>

<p>Kyrgyzstan has recently been under intense scrutiny for a variety of rights violations. In March <a href="http://www.hrw.org/">Human Rights Watch </a> (HRW) [advocacy website] <a href="/paperchase/2015/03/hrw-urges-european-leaders-to-raise-concerns-over-kyrgyzstan.php">urged</a> [JURIST report] EU leaders France, Germany and Switzerland to raise human rights concerns directly with Atambayev. In January a spokesperson for the Kyrgyzstan government <a href="/paperchase/2015/01/kyrgyzstan-considering-leglsiation-allowing-government-to-shut-down-media-outlets.php">discussed</a> [JURIST report] proposed legislation that would allow the Kyrgyz government to shut down media outlets without requiring a court decision with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In October 2014 Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/un-human-rights-office-urges-kyrgyzstan-to-reject-discriminatory-lgbt-bill.php">urged the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan to reject</a> [JURIST report] proposed legislation institutionalizing discrimination against individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Also in October 2014 the US Embassy in Kyrgyzstan <a href="/paperchase/2014/10/us-condemns-kyrgyzstan-proposed-gay-propaganda-ban.php">issued a press release</a> [JURIST report] condemning the proposed ban on homosexual propaganda legislation. In January 2014 HRW <a href="/paperchase/2014/01/hrw-gay-men-in-kyrgyzstan-target-for-police-abuse.php">released a report</a> [JURIST report] detailing abuses against gay and bisexual men at the hands of police in Kyrgyzstan. The report, entitled, "They Told Us We Deserved This: Police Violence against Gay and Bisexual Men in Kyrgyzstan," found that gay and bisexual men have been subjected to abuses including physical, sexual and psychological violence, arbitrary detention and extortion under the threat of violence by police officers, despite the decriminalization of consensual sex between men in 1998.</p>]]></content:encoded>
